0,Inhibition of cellular transport processes by 5-thio-D-glucopyranose,"5-Thio-d-glucopyranose, the nearest analogue of normal d-glucose, which is proving a useful tool in examinations of d-glucose biochemistry, affects active and facilitated-diffusion transport processes. 5-Thio-d-glucose is readily transported in rabbit kidney-cortex slices and reaches a tissue/medium ratio of 6.5 within 40min. The sulphur analogue shows typical saturation kinetics with a K(m) value of 2.4mm and V(max.) value of 70mumol/h per g of cell water. Uptake of 5-thio-d-glucose is phlorrhizin-sensitive, Na(+)-dependent and energy-dependent. d-Galactose and methyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside transport is competitively inhibited by 5-thio-d-glucose with K(i) values of 4.8 and 9.7mm respectively. 5-Thio-d-glucose thus shows all of the characteristics of active transport in kidney cortex. Transport of neutral amino acids in rat kidney cortex is inhibited by 5-thio-d-glucose. Thus 5.6mm-5-thio-d-glucose causes a 25-30% inhibition of the transport of glycine and the non-metabolized amino acids cycloleucine and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. 5-Thio-d-glucose is freely taken up by the facilitated-diffusion transport system in rat diaphragm muscle. The sulphur analogue inhibits the transport of d-xylose in this tissue but has no effect on the uptake of d-arabinose. It is concluded that the ring heteroatom is not an effector of binding in the transport processes examined and causes no important alteration in the conformation of the sugar. The diabetogenic action produced by 5-thio-d-glucose is due, in part, to the ability of the analogue to interfere with cellular transport processes that use d-glucose.",0
1,Age-related characteristics of structural support for ovarian function,"Histoenzymological assay was used to investigate various structures of the ovaries of rats of two groups aged 3-4 and 12-14 months during estral cycle. The activity of 3 beta-, 17 beta- and 20 alpha-steroid dehydrogenases, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NAD and NADP-diaphorases, esterase, acid and alkaline phosphatases was studied. It has been shown that transport alterations in the microcirculation including the hematofollicular barrier play, the leading part in age-dependent depression of reproductive and endocrine functions. Ageing rats demonstrated no linkage between endothelial, thecal and granular cells, which points to the injury of the histophysiological mechanisms of the follicular system integration.",0
2,Long-lasting marked inhibition of periaqueductal gray-evoked defensive behaviors in inescapably-shocked rats,"Clinical evidence suggests that depression and trauma predispose the subject to panic. Accordingly, here we examined the late effects of uncontrollable stress, a presumptive model of depression and/or traumatic disorder, on panic-like behaviors evoked by electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG). Changes in anxiety and depression were also assessed in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and forced-swimming test (FST), respectively. Rats with electrodes in the DPAG were subjected to a 7-day shuttle-box one-way escape yoked training with foot-shocks either escapable (ES) or inescapable (IS). The day after the end of one-way escape training, rats were trained in a two-way escape novel task (test-session) to ascertain the effectiveness of uncontrollable stress. DPAG stimulations were carried out in an open field, both before the escape training and 2 and 7 days after it, and EPM and FST were performed on the 8th and 10th days afterwards, respectively. Controls were either trained with fictive shocks (FS) or subjected to intracranial stimulations only. Although the ES rats performed significantly better than the IS group in the two-way escape task, groups did not differ with respect to either the anxiety or depression scores. Unexpectedly, however, IS rats showed a marked attenuation of DPAG-evoked freezing and flight behaviors relative to both the ES and FS groups, 2 and 7 days after one-way escape training. The conjoint inhibition of passive (freezing) and active (flight) defensive behaviors suggests that IS inhibits a DPAG in-built motivational system that may be implicated in depressed patients' difficulties in coping with daily-life stress.",1
3,Glycine attenuates hepatocellular depression during early sepsis and reduces sepsis-induced mortality,"Objectives: To determine whether administration of glycine, a nonessential amino acid, early after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis has any beneficial effects on hepatocellular function and the survivability of septic animals and, if so, whether the beneficial effects of glycine are associated with down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. Design: Prospective, controlled, and randomized animal study. Setting: A university research laboratory. Subjects: Male adult rats were subjected to polymicrobial sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture or sham operation followed by the administration of normal saline solution. Measurements and main results: At 1 hr after cecal ligation and puncture, glycine (0.6 mmol/kg) or vehicle (normal saline solution) was administered intravenously over 15 mins. At 5 hrs after cecal ligation and puncture (i.e., early stage of sepsis), hepatocellular function (i.e., the maximal velocity and efficiency of in vivo indocyanine green clearance) was determined and hepatocyte injury was assessed by measuring plasma concentrations of alpha-gluthathione S-transferase. Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In additional animals, the necrotic cecum was excised at 20 hrs after cecal ligation and puncture, the peritoneal cavity was irrigated with saline, and the midline incision was closed in layers. Mortality was monitored for 10 days thereafter. The results indicate that hepatocellular function was depressed in the early stage of sepsis (i.e., 5 hrs after cecal ligation and puncture) as indicated by significant decreases in both maximal velocity and transport efficiency of in vivo indocyanine green clearance. Plasma concentrations of alpha-gluthathione S-transferase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were elevated significantly at that interval after cecal ligation and puncture. Administration of glycine 1 hr after cecal ligation and puncture, however, increased maximal velocity and maximal efficiency by 60% and 101% (p <.05), respectively. Glycine administration in septic animals decreased alpha-gluthathione S-transferase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by 43% and 80% (p <.05). In addition, glycine treatment decreased the mortality rate from 50% to 0% (p <.05) at 10 days after cecal ligation and puncture and cecal excision. Conclusions: It appears that the beneficial effect of glycine on hepatocyte function and integrity in sepsis may be mediated via down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Because administration of glycine attenuated hepatocellular depression and injury during early sepsis and decreased sepsis-induced mortality rates, this amino acid appears to be a useful adjunct for maintaining cellular functions and preventing lethality from polymicrobial sepsis.",0
4,Chinese medicine Banxia-houpu decoction regulates c-fos expression in the brain regions in chronic mild stress model in rats,"Banxia-houpu decoction is a safe and effective traditional Chinese medicinal formula used in the treatment of mild and manic-depressive disorders for centuries. There has been increasing interest in its therapeutic application in depression. However, the mechanisms behind behavioural changes are still poorly understood. Chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced preference behaviour change has been used as a model to predict the clinical efficacy of many types of antidepressant treatment. Both EtOH and water extracts (AE and WE) of Banxia-houpu decoction exhibited a significantly increased sucrose intake in the CMS model in rats, but there was no effect in unstressed animals. In the present study, it was found that the c-fos expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum corpora were very high in the CMS model in rats. WE and AE at a dose of 130 mg/kg exhibited a significantly decreased c-fos expression in the cerebral regions in CMS model in rats, respectively. The former was more potent than the latter. However, no significant changes in the c-fos expression were observed in unstressed rats treated with the decoction. Fluoxetine not only significantly reduced c-fos expression in all regions in the CMS model in rats, but only showed a marked decrease in c-fos expression in the hippocampus in unstressed animals. A different molecular mechanism of Banxia-houpu decoction and fluoxetine may be implied. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum conpora might be important structural substrates in the central nervous system mediating the section of the Banxia-houpu decoction on preference behaviour in CMS-induced rats, and fos protein might be the common substrate of the signal transduction process of the decoction.",1
5,Brain monoamine receptors in a chronic unpredictable stress model in rats,"Antidepressant drugs are devoid of mood-elevating effects in normal (non-depressed) human subjects, thus, it is necessary to evaluate the antidepressant property of compounds (drugs) in animal models of depression. Several animal models of depression have been introduced, however, only a few have been extensively validated. In the present study we report the results of investigations into monoaminergic receptors in the brain of rats subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) procedure (one of the well validated animal models of depression). We have examined the dopaminergic (D-1, D-2), adrenergic (alpha-1, beta-1) and serotonergic (5HT-1A, 5HT-2A) receptors in different brain regions by a saturation radioligand binding method in rats subjected to CUS paradigm and control animals. CUS procedure resulted in a significant 29% increase in the D-1 receptor density in the limbic system and 52% increase of the density of 5HT-2A receptors in the cerebral cortex. The present data indicate that the increase of the density of brain D-1 and 5HT-2A receptors of rats subjected to CUS might be involved in the pathophysiology of 'animal depression' (since chronic antidepressant treatment produced opposite changes i.e. decrease in the density of these receptors) and thus in pathophysiology of human depression.",1
6,Behavioural and neuroendocrine effects of aqueous extract of Boerhaavia diffusa Linn. in mice using tail suspension and forced swim tests--a preliminary study,"The present study was done to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of B. diffusa on depression in mice using behavioral models such as tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST). The extract (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, po) was administered for 14 successive days to Swiss young albino mice. On 14th day, 60 min after administration, mice were subjected to TST and FST. The administration of aqueous extract of B. diffusa (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, po) significantly decreased immobility period in both TST and FST, indicating significant antidepressant-like activity. The lowest dose (50 mg/kg) of the extract decreased the immobility period most significantly in FST, showing most potent antidepressant-like action. The efficacy of the extract (50 mg/kg) was comparable to fluoxetine (20 mg/kg). The extract did not show any significant effect on locomotor activity. The extract showed significant monoamine oxidase -A inhibitory activity. There was no significant effect of the extract on plasma corticosterone levels. Prazosin (alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist), sulpiride (selective D2-receptor antagonist), baclofen (GABA(B) agonist), and p-CPA (tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor) significantly attenuated the extract-induced antidepressant-like effect, when tested in TST. The extract might produce antidepressant-like effect by interaction with alpha1-adrenoceptors, dopamine-D2 receptors, serotonergic, and GABA(B) receptors. Thus, aqueous extract of B. diffusa showed significant antidepressant-like activity in mice probably through involvement of monoaminergic and GABAergic systems.",1
7,Seasonality of glycogen phosphorylase activity in crucian carp (Carassius carassius L.),"Seasonal changes in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), a rate-limiting enzyme of glycogen degradation, were examined in an anoxia-tolerant fish species, the crucian carp (Carassius carassius L.). In muscle and brain, the activity of GP remained constant throughout the year when tested at 25°C. In contrast, the activities of liver and heart GP displayed striking increases in summer. When seasonal temperature changes are taken into account, the activity of GP during the anoxic mid-winter is only 4-6% of its summer time activity in the muscle, heart and liver, and 13% in brain. In winter-acclimatized fish, experimental anoxia (1-6 weeks) caused sustained depression of the GP activity in heart and gills. In liver and muscle, a transient depression of GP activity occurred during the first week of anoxia but later GP activity recovered back to the normoxic level. GP of the brain was completely resistant to anoxia. In all studied tissues, the constitutive activity of GP is more than sufficient to degrade glycogen deposits during winter anoxia without anoxia-induced activation of GP. The seemingly paradoxical summer-time increase in the activity of liver and heart GP could be related to active life-style of the summer-acclimatized fish (growth, reproduction), the increased demand of energy and molecular precursors of anabolic metabolism being satisfied by preferential degradation of glycogen. The high glycogen content of winter-acclimatized crucian carp is not associated with the elevated GP activity or anoxic activation of GP.",0
8,"Effect of chronic lead on the haematology, blood glutathione and bone marrow non-haeme iron of dogs","Ten clinically normal male beagle dogs were used in the study. Two dogs served as control, 4 received 2 mg lead/kg daily and 4 received 5 mg lead/kg/daily. Lead was administered for 13 weeks, after which one-half of each experimental group was treated with calcium ethylene diaminetetraacetate (CaEDTA) for 5 days. All animals were then monitored for another 4 weeks. Blood lead levels, haematology, blood glutathione concentration, and the number of bone marrow cells with stainable iron granules were measured weekly during the 18-week experimental period. Clinical signs of poisoning were observed only in one dog in the high dose group after 6 weeks. The signed included emaciation, anorexia, muscular weakness, evidence of abdominal pain and depression. These signs were reversed with cessation of lead dosing and CaEDTA treatment. Blood lead levels and the number of marrow cells with non-haeme iron increased in both lead-dosed groups; nucleated red blood cells increased only in high lead dosed group. There was a trend for an increased packed cell volume in all groups; however, the high lead dosed group did not increase as fast. No significant changes were observed in blood glutathione concentration and in other haematologic parameters. There were no differences in the parameters studied between the dogs treated with CaEDTA and those not so treated. Blood lead levels and the number of nucleated red blood cells decreased after cessation of lead administration and the number of marrow cells with iron also tended to decrease after lead removal.",0
9,Effects of nitrous oxide on myocardial contractility as evaluated by the preload recruitable stroke work relationship in chronically instrumented dogs,"Assessment of the effects of nitrous oxide on myocardial contractile function in vivo has been complicated by lack of a reliable, easily quantified, load-independent index of contractility and by the presence of intact autonomic nervous system reflexes. Although several previous investigations in humans and experimental animals have demonstrated that nitrous oxide possesses direct negative inotropic effects, this conclusion remains controversial. This investigation reexamined the effect of nitrous oxide on myocardial contractile function when this agent was combined with baseline isoflurane or sufentanil anesthesia in chronically instrumented dogs. Contractility was evaluated with the use of the regional preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW)-end-diastolic segment length relationship, a method that provides an accurate, relatively afterload-independent assessment of inotropic state in conscious and anesthetized dogs. Because autonomic nervous system tone may influence the response of systemic hemodynamics to anesthesia in vivo, experiments were performed in the presence of pharmacologic blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Two groups of experiments, consisting of a total of 15 experiments, were performed with 12 dogs. Dogs, chronically instrumented for measurement of systemic hemodynamics, including left ventricular pressure and subendocardial segment length, were anesthetized with isoflurane or sufentanil. Thirty percent and 70% nitrous oxide were then administered in a random fashion. Left ventricular pressure-segment length loops were generated after 30 min of equilibration after each anesthetic intervention with the use of preload reduction by partial inferior vena caval constriction, and regional PRSW was calculated. Regional PRSW versus end-diastolic length slope reflected decreases in contractile state when nitrous oxide was added to isoflurane (50 +/- 5 for isoflurane alone to 28 +/- 2 erg.cm-2 x 10(-3).min-1 with 70% added nitrous oxide) or sufentanil (73 +/- 8 for sufentanil alone to 52 +/- 5 erg.cm-2 x 10(-3).mm-1 with 70% added nitrous oxide). Similar decreases in left ventricular positive dP/dt50 were observed as well, reflecting decreases in contractile function. The results further suggest that the degree of functional depression produced by nitrous oxide is nearly equal when isoflurane and sufentanil groups are compared. This study demonstrates that nitrous oxide possesses direct negative inotropic actions independent of changes in autonomic nervous system tone in the chronically instrumented dog.",0
10,Multiple receptors contribute to the behavioral effects of indoleamine hallucinogens,"Serotonergic hallucinogens produce profound changes in perception, mood, and cognition. These drugs include phenylalkylamines such as mescaline and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), and indoleamines such as (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin. Despite their differences in chemical structure, the two classes of hallucinogens produce remarkably similar subjective effects in humans, and induce cross-tolerance. The phenylalkylamine hallucinogens are selective 5-HT(2) receptor agonists, whereas the indoleamines are relatively non-selective for serotonin (5-HT) receptors. There is extensive evidence, from both animal and human studies, that the characteristic effects of hallucinogens are mediated by interactions with the 5-HT(2A) receptor. Nevertheless, there is also evidence that interactions with other receptor sites contribute to the psychopharmacological and behavioral effects of the indoleamine hallucinogens. This article reviews the evidence demonstrating that the effects of indoleamine hallucinogens in a variety of animal behavioral paradigms are mediated by both 5-HT(2) and non-5-HT(2) receptors.",0
11,Novel Migraine Mechanisms as Targets for Therapy,"Advances in genetics, laboratory models, and imaging techniques are providing new information about migraine mechanisms that may be targets for new treatments. Imaging and physiological recording of cortical spreading depression in rodent models reveals complex neuronal, glial, and vascular changes that may last for hours after a single spreading depression event. We have identified multiple pharmacological approaches to inhibiting cortical spreading depression and the cellular changes that accompany it. We have also developed rodent behavioral models to investigate migraine-related pain behavior. Administration of nitroglycerin, a well known migraine trigger, evokes hyperalgesia and avoidance behaviors in mice. Repetitive intermittent administration of nitroglycerin over days results in progressive and sustained hyperalgesia, which may represent a model for chronic migraine. We have been using these behavioral models, along with the spreading depression model, to identify and characterize new potential migraine treatments. We have also used the spreading depression and behavioral models to study the functional effects of a new human migraine gene. These results may facilitate the rapid development of novel therapeutic approaches to patients with migraine.",0
12,A miniature mechanical ventilator for newborn mice,"Transgenic/knockout mice with pre-defined mutations have become increasingly popular in biomedical research as models of human diseases. In some instances, the resulting mutation may cause cardiorespiratory distress in the neonatal or adult animals and may necessitate resuscitation. Here we describe the design and testing of a miniature and versatile ventilator that can deliver varying ventilatory support modes, including conventional mechanical ventilation and high-frequency ventilation, to animals as small as the newborn mouse. With a double-piston body chamber design, the device circumvents the problem of air leakage and obviates the need for invasive procedures such as endotracheal intubation, which are particularly important in ventilating small animals. Preliminary tests on newborn mice as early as postnatal day O demonstrated satisfactory restoration of pulmonary ventilation and the prevention of respiratory failure in mutant mice that are prone to respiratory depression. This device may prove useful in the postnatal management of transgenic/knockout mice with genetically inflicted respiratory disorders.",0
13,5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside raises adenosine in perfused hypoxic rat heart,"The effects of 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (rAICA) on coronary adenosine efflux were examined in blood-free perfused working rat heart preparations subjected to mild (70% O2) and severe hypoxia (45% O2). Under these hypoxic conditions, no significant increase of coronary adenosine effluxes was observed in the presence of 300 microM rAICA alone. However, rAICA-induced augmentation of coronary adenosine efflux during hypoxia was revealed in the presence of an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, erythro-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine hydrochloride, indicating that the failure to note the increase in coronary adenosine efflux was due to a rapid deamination of adenosine to inosine. A depression in heart rate during mild and severe hypoxia was significantly exacerbated by rAICA. These effects on heart rate were mediated by adenosine, since they were effectively blocked by 1,3-dipropyl-8-(2-amino-4-chlorophenyl)xanthine, a selective adenosine A1-receptor antagonist. These results suggest that rAICA elevates adenosine efflux during hypoxia.",0
14,Effects of data structure and selection on estimated inbreeding depression in experimental Tribolium castaneum lines,"Inbreeding depression was estimated for four experimental Tribolium castaneum lines. Each line, containing approximately 7000 animals, was selected for 16 generations either randomly (control), on pupae weight (PWT), on family size (FST) or on an index containing both PWT and FST. The inbreeding trend was 0.9, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.4 % inbreeding per generation in PWT-selected, FST-selected, index-selected, and control line, respectively. The model used to estimate the inbreeding depression included a linear regression on individual inbreeding coefficients, and random additive genetic effects. Using all the performance and pedigree data, estimated inbreeding depressions in the control line were -0.13 (SE = 0.16; #) and -8.50 (SE = 2.66; μg) per 1 % inbreeding for FST and PWT, respectively. Using only performance data of the latest generation in the control line, the estimated inbreeding depressions changed considerably: -0.17 (SE = 0.82) and -37.4 (SE= 11.9) for FST and PWT, respectively. Estimated inbreeding depression for FST in the FST-selected line was - 0.40 (SE = 0.31). Inbreeding depression for PWT in the PWT-selected line was 21.6 (SE = 25.8). This study indicates that estimating inbreeding depression might best be based on the performance data of animals with an equal and sufficiently-large number of ancestral generations known. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Wirkung von Datenstruktur und Selektion auf geschätzte Inzuchtdepression in experimentellen Triboleum castaneum Linien Jede der vier experimentellen Linien, aus je etwa 7000 Individuen, wurde durch 16 Generationen selektiert, zufällig die Kontrolle, auf Puppengewicht (PWT), Familiengröße (FST), oder auf einen beide Merkmale kombinierenden Index. Inzucntzuwächse in diesen vier Linien waren 0.4, 0.9, 0.5 und 0.5% je Generation. Das Modell zur Schätzung der Inzuchtdepression beinhaltete eine lineare Regression auf individuelle Inzuchtkoeffizienten und zufällige additive-genetische Wirkungen. Aus allen Daten, Leistung und Pedigree, ergaben sich -0.13 (SE = 0.16; #) und - 8.5 (SE = 2.66; mg) je 1% Inzucht für FST und PWT, Daten der letzten Generation ergaben deutlich andere Werte: -0.17 (SE = 0.82) und -37.4 (SE = 11.9) für FST und PWT. Inzuchtdepressionen für FST bzw. PWT in den jeweils hierfür selektierten Linien waren -0.40 (SE = 0.31) und 21.6 (SE = 25.8). Es wird gefolgert, daß Schätzungen auf Leistungen von hinreichend großer Zahl von Vorfahrengenerationen beruhen sollten.",0
15,"The protective action of zinc against the deleterious effects of cadmium in the regenerating forelimb of the adult newt, Notophthalmus viridescens","Forelimbs of adult male newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) were amputated and immediately dipped in cadmium nitrate for 2 minutes; in addition, some of the newts were injected with zinc chloride 24 hours prior to, or 24 hours after amputation. Dipping the amputated forelimb of a newt in a solution of 0.4 M cadmium nitrate completely inhibited or retarded regeneration throughout the 65 days of observation. Other effects of cadmium administration included erythema of the limb, an extensive protrusion of the humerus, and in some cases atypical differentiation of regenerates. When zinc chloride was injected (0.04 mg/g of body weight) intraperitoneally into the newt 24 hours prior to limb amputation and cadmium dipping, the deleterious effects of cadmium treatment were prevented and normal regeneration occurred. When zinc chloride was administered 24 hours after amputation and cadmium dipping, it gave no protection against the cadmium. It is suggested that cadmium might inhibit regeneration through the inactivation of zinc metalloenzymes as a result of an exchange of cadmium for zinc. Zinc chloride administered to newts prior to cadmium treatment may prevent the replacement of zinc by cadmium.",0
16,The effect of betamethasone on circadian and stress-induced pituitary-adrenocortical function in the rat,"1. Both the circadian and stress-induced changes in plasma corticosterone concentration were abolished by the inclusion of betamethasone in the drinking water of rats.2. Adrenal sensitivity to exogenous corticotrophin (ACTH) was unimpaired by the betamethasone treatment.3. The normal circadian rhythm in plasma corticosterone returned within 1 day of withdrawal of the steroid, but the response to stress was normal only after 3 days.4. The possible significance of these observations is discussed.",0
17,"Dietary interactions of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) trypsin inhibitor, haemagglutinin and cyanide. Part 2. Effect on pancreatic and intestinal alpha-amylase (EC 3.21.1.1) in growing albino rats","A total of 108 growing albino rats was used to evaluate the dietary interactions of the major lima bean antinutritional factors trypsin inhibitor (TI), haemagglutinin (Hgg) and cyanide (CN) with respect to their effects on pancreatic and intestinal alpha-amylase activities. The results indicate that when fed at the same level of activity as found in the raw lima bean (RLB) these factors had no significant (p greater than 0.05) influence on pancreatic alpha-amylase activity whether acting individually or in combination. However, when acting alone, CN appeared to depress pancreatic amylase level more than when interacting with TI or Hgg or both. Amylase activity was significantly (p less than 0.01) depressed by the dietary treatments in both the small and large intestine while caecal levels were not. The most severe depression in amylase activity was elicited by the RLB diet. The haemagglutinin-containing diets appeared generally associated with lower levels of intestinal amylase activity. From the present finding it is suggested that these factors alone cannot fully account for the magnitude of the depression of intestinal amylase activity which is contingent upon the ingestion of RLB by experimental rats.",0
18,Developmental profile of GABAA-mediated synaptic transmission in pyramidal cells of the somatosensory cortex,"Inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors is involved in regulation of experience-dependent cortical plasticity. However, little information is available on their presynaptic and postsynaptic developmental profiles. The present study aims to investigate the developmental changes of miniature and unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs and uIPSCs) in mouse barrel cortex. mIPSCs recorded from supragranular pyramidal neurons showed a gradual increase in frequency during postnatal days 6-15 (PD6-15) followed by a marked increase at PD16-20, and mIPSCs frequency reached a plateau at about PD21-30. The amplitude of mIPSCs showed a transient decrease at PD10-12 followed by an increase during PD13-30, and reached a plateau at about PD30. Their decay time constant progressively decreased during the first 30 days postnatally, and reached a steady level at about PD30. Paired recordings from interneurons and synaptically coupled target pyramidal cells revealed that uIPSC amplitude increased with age up to PD30. In contrast, failure rate and coefficient of variation decreased during PD7-15 and showed little change at a later stage. Short-term depression induced by presynaptic stimulation at 33 Hz progressively decreased during PD6-20, and was stabilized at about PD21-30. Quantal analysis revealed that the number of release sites increased with age up to PD30, while the release probability increased during PD6-12 and then reached a plateau level. These results suggest that the number of release sites and release probability of GABA and GABA(A)-mediated IPSC kinetics show distinct developmental profiles, which could play roles in regulating the onset and offset of critical periods for experience-dependent cortical plasticity.",0
19,Social instability in female rats: the relationship between stress-related and anxiety-like consequences,"It is generally believed that anxiety and depression develop in response to stressful events that chronically increase glucocorticoid production (which in turn affects various neurotransmitter systems). In contrast to depression, however, the relationship between chronic stress and anxiety is less clear, as anxiety patients often show normal glucocorticoid levels and respond normally to dexamethasone challenge. Here we report on the interaction between symptoms of chronic stress and anxiety in female rats by making use of the social instability model of anxiety. Subjects were exposed to alternating 24 h periods of isolation and moderate crowding for 14 days. Symptoms of chronic stress and anxiety-like behaviour in the social interaction test were evaluated on the 15th day, i.e. 1 day after the last crowding phase. Social instability resulted in decreased weight gain, and chronically elevated plasma glucocorticoid levels only in rats that showed high aggressiveness during the crowding phases. In contrast, anxiety-like behaviour was increased irrespective to crowding-related aggressiveness. Thus, the development of chronic stress symptoms and anxiety-like behaviour dissociated: the former was bound to crowding-induced aggressiveness (i.e. to a higher stress load), whereas the latter occurred also when such aggressiveness was low, and symptoms of chronic stress did not develop. This finding is consistent with human data, and suggests that stressful events lead to anxiety in both cases: when stressors do or do not lead to chronic stress responses. Studying the distinctive features of anxieties associated or not with chronic endocrine stress responses would enhance our understanding of this disorder.",0
20,Adaptation of monoaminergic responses to phencyclidine in nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex following repeated treatment with fluoxetine or imipramine,"The adaptive neuronal changes that follow chronic administration of antidepressant drugs are thought to underlie clinical improvement in patient populations. Recent evidence suggests that alterations specific to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may be a final common pathway to antidepressant action. To investigate this possibility, we sought to establish the effects of chronic fluoxetine or imipramine treatment on the monoamine stimulating effect of the non-competitive NMDA antagonist phencyclidine. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats (n=9/group) were treated with saline (1 ml/kg, i.p.), imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 14 consecutive days. After a 7-day drug-free period, animals given an acute challenge of either saline or phencyclidine (5 mg/kg, i.p.). One hour later, animals were killed, brains were removed, and the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens were dissected. Samples were assayed for the monoamines and their primary metabolites by HPLC. Repeated treatment with fluoxetine or imipramine did not alter baseline dopamine or serotonin turnover. Acute phencyclidine treatment increased prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens dopamine turnover in saline-treated animals (P<0.01); however, the effect in the nucleus accumbens was prevented in animals pretreated with imipramine or fluoxetine. Acute phencyclidine challenge also increased serotonin turnover in prefrontal cortex of saline- or imipramine-pretreated rats (P<0.01), though this effect was attenuated in animals pretreated with fluoxetine. Overall, the data suggest that repeated antidepressant treatment alters monoamine turnover in specific brain regions in response to blockade of NMDA receptors. The data highlight the importance of adaptive responses to NMDA receptors resulting from chronic antidepressant treatment.",1
21,Norepinephrine transporter knock-out alters expression of the genes connected with antidepressant drugs action,"Norepinephrine transporter knock-out mice (NET-KO) exhibit depression-resistant phenotypes. They manifest significantly shorter immobility times in both the forced swim test and the tail suspension test. Moreover, biochemical studies have revealed the up-regulation of other monoamine transporters (dopamine and serotonin) in the brains of NET-KO mice, similar to the phenomenon observed after the chronic pharmacological blockade of norepinephrine transporter by desipramine in wild-type (WT) animals. NET-KO mice are also resistant to stress, as we demonstrated previously by measuring plasma corticosterone concentration. In the present study, we used a microdissection technique to separate target brain regions and the TaqMan Low Density Array approach to test the expression of a group of genes in the NET-KO mice compared with WT animals. A group of genes with altered expression were identified in four brain structures (frontal and cingulate cortices, dentate gyrus of hippocampus and basal-lateral amygdala) of NET-KO mice compared with WT mice. These genes are known to be altered by antidepressant drugs administration. The most interesting gene is Crh-bp, which modulates the activity of corticotrophin--releasing hormone (CRH) and several CRH-family members. Generally, genetic disturbances within noradrenergic neurons result in biological changes, such as in signal transduction and intercellular communication, and may be linked to changes in noradrenaline levels in the brains of NET-KO mice.",1
22,Endogenous lipid pneumonia in an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus erithacus),"Lipid pneumonia is an unusual, non-infectious, inflammatory lung disease characterized by patchy pneumonic consolidation secondary to accumulation of lipid in macrophages. It can be classified as exogenous or endogenous, depending on whether it is associated with the aspiration of foreign material. Endogenous lipid pneumonia (EnLP) has been reported in many mammal species. In pet birds, EnLP is an incidental and uncommon lesion of unknown pathogenesis. A 35-year-old African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus erithacus) was presented for depression lasting several months, with marked worsening over the 2 days prior to presentation. The animal died shortly after admission. Necropsy examination showed that the lungs were firm with diffuse grey discolouration. Microscopically, there was EnLP, anthracosis, severe atherosclerosis and hepatic amyloidosis. Although the pathogenesis of EnLP in birds is not clear, it has been associated with concurrent atherosclerosis, hepatic diseases and other lesions of the respiratory tract. This is the first description of EnLP in a bird associated with severe respiratory distress.",0
23,Study of huchang qingfei pellets on immune function in rats infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae,"Objective: To study the effects and mechanism of Huchang Qingfei pellets on immune function in rats infected with mycoplasma pneumoniae. Method: A rat model of mycoplasmal pneumonia (MP) was developed in repeated intranasal infectious routes and then the humoral and cellular immunocompetences were detected by radioimmunoassay, immune-turbidimetry and flow cytometry. Result: The levels of serum IgG,IgM and IL-2, IL-6 were enhinced obviously, the complement C3 and TNF-alpha were decreased and the ratio of CD4+ /CD8+ was improved significantly in the Huchang groups as compared with MP model group. Conclusion: Huchang Qingfei pellets can reinforce immune function via preventing both cellular and humoral immunity from depression in the rats with MP.",0
24,Macromolecular synthetic activity in mice regenerating liver after ethylnitrosourea injection,"The present report is a continuation of our previous studies on the biochemical mechanisms of carcinogenesis; studying the nature of interactions taking place between Ethylnitrosourea and DNA, RNA and protein of various stages of their synthetic activity. As a model system we chose partially hepatectomized mice live 36 hrs after surgery. Synthetic macromolecule activity in the remaining liver segment was determined by means of 3H-thymidine, 3H-uridine and 3H-leucine. We observed complete depression of DNA synthetic activity (immediately after Ethylnitrosourea administration it remained depressed almost through out the whole period of our observations) while protein synthetic activity was highly elevated. Qualitative changes of soluble proteins which were analyzed by isoelectric fractionation on 5% polyacrylamide after previous 3H- and 14C-leucine incorporation, could not be detected. Our biochemical data are correlated with histological studies and with the tumour incidence following the Ethylnitrosourea treatment of partially hepatectomized mice in the course of long-term experiments. The results provide guideline for further analysis, which should be modified according to the information concerning Ethylnitrosourea carcinogenesis induced 36 hours after partial hepatectmoy.",0
25,"Heavy metals zinc, cadmium, and copper stimulate pulmonary sensory neurons via direct activation of TRPA1","Airway exposure to zinc dust and zinc-containing ambient particulates can cause symptoms of airway irritation and inflammation, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are largely unknown. Transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) is selectively expressed in a subpopulation of pulmonary C-fiber afferents and has been considered as a major irritant sensor in the lung and airways. Using whole cell patch-clamp recording and Ca(2+) imaging, we have demonstrated that application of ZnCl(2) concentration dependently evoked inward current and Ca(2+) transient in isolated vagal pulmonary sensory neurons; both responses were almost completely inhibited after pretreatment with AP18, a specific TRPA1 antagonist. In anesthetized spontaneously breathing animals, intratracheal instillation of ZnCl(2) (2 mM, 25 microl) induced pronounced respiratory depression in wild-type mice, and the effect was essentially absent in TRPA1-deficient mice. In addition, our study showed that two other heavy metals, cadmium and copper, also stimulated pulmonary sensory neurons via a direct activation of TRPA1. In summary, our results suggest that activation of TRPA1 in pulmonary C-fiber sensory nerves may contribute to the respiratory toxicity induced by airway exposure to these three heavy metals.",0
26,Responses to cortical injury: II. Widespread depression of the activity of an enzyme in cortex remote from a focal injury,"As a part of a broader study of the reaction of the brain to injury, we report here an interesting loss of the activity of an enzyme in areas quite remote from the site of direct injury. At 36 h following a laceration or contusion injury to the hindpaw area of the motor cortex, a peculiar loss of staining for the enzyme alpha glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH) was noted. alpha-GPDH activity was markedly depressed in cortical layers II and III throughout the hemisphere on the side of the injury. The depression of alpha-GPDH activity extended far laterally across the rhinal fissure into the pyriform cortex. The decrease in alpha-GPDH staining was prominent 4 days after the injury: however, the staining pattern had returned to normal at 9 days. Enzyme changes in animals lesioned in the occipital cortex paralleled that seen in animals with a lesion in the motor cortex. Animals which had received an undercut lesion in the motor cortex 56 days earlier were contused in the occipital cortex. The old injury site presented the same sequelae of changes as seen in other lesioned animals. Additionally, a suction ablation injury involving only a small part of motor cortex resulted in the same widespread reduction of staining for alpha-GPDH in layers II and III. The derangement in energy metabolism suggests that cells in layers II and III of the cerebral cortex may be particularly vulnerable to perturbations induced by cortical trauma. These findings may be related to the diffuse and transient functional losses observed after head injury in man.",0
27,Insomnia and exacerbation of anxiety associated with high-EPA fish oil supplements after successful treatment of depression,"A 54-year-old male consulted his general practitioner for increasing general anxiety and mild panic attacks despite effective treatment for recurrent major depressive disorder, which included a fish oil supplement enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The patient would awaken suddenly at night with shortness of breath and overwhelming worry. During the daytime, he felt a general, nonspecific anxiety and frequently experienced sympathetic activation upon confronting routine challenges. He also experienced dyspnea-induced feelings of panic. He reported that he stopped taking the fish oil supplements after several more months of symptoms, and his anxiety and insomnia then largely disappeared. Several weeks later, he resumed consumption of high-EPA fish oil at the prior dosage for 2 days. On both nights, the patient reported nighttime awakening similar to the previous episodes, followed by daytime agitation. Since halting the fish oil supplements, the anxiety and insomnia have not returned and his depression remains in remission.",0
28,"Astragalar morphology of Afradapis, a large adapiform primate from the earliest late Eocene of Egypt","The ∼37 million-year-old Birket Qarun Locality 2 (BQ-2), in the Birket Qarun Formation of Egypt's Fayum Depression, yields evidence for a diverse primate fauna, including the earliest known lorisiforms, parapithecoid anthropoids, and Afradapis longicristatus, a large folivorous adapiform. Phylogenetic analysis has placed Afradapis as a stem strepsirrhine within a clade of caenopithecine adapiforms, contradicting the recently popularized alternative hypothesis aligning adapiforms with haplorhines or anthropoids. We describe an astragalus from BQ-2 (DPC 21445C), attributable to Afradapis on the basis of size and relative abundance. The astragalus is remarkably similar to those of extant lorises, having a low body, no posterior shelf, a broad head and neck. It is like extant strepsirrhines more generally, in having a fibular facet that slopes gently away from the lateral tibial facet, and in having a groove for the tendon of flexor fibularis that is lateral to the tibial facet. Comparisons to a sample of euarchontan astragali show the new fossil to be most similar to those of adapines and lorisids. The astragali of other adapiforms are most similar to those of lemurs, but distinctly different from those of all anthropoids. Our measurements show that in extant strepsirrhines and adapiforms the fibular facet slopes away from the lateral tibial facet at a gradual angle (112-126°), in contrast to the anthropoid fibular facet, which forms a sharper angle (87-101°). Phylogenetic analyses incorporating new information from the astragalus continue to support strepsirrhine affinities for adapiforms under varying models of character evolution.",0
29,Region-specific dysregulation of allopregnanolone brain content in the olfactory bulbectomized rat model of depression,"Allopregnanolone (ALLO) is one of the most potent positive endogenous allosteric modulators of the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors. While the robust anxiolytic profile of ALLO has been extensively characterized in rodents and its antidepressant-like effect was recently demonstrated in mice, there have been only few reports on alterations of brain ALLO levels in putative animal models of depression and anxiety. Removal of the olfactory bulbs of rats produces one of the most predictive animal models with which to screen for drugs with potential antidepressant activity following repeated treatment. We therefore investigated whether the olfactory bulbectomized (OB) rat model of depression may be associated with alterations of ALLO levels in whole brain tissue and in different brain regions. We determined ALLO levels in whole brain, amygdala, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and whole cerebral cortex of OB or sham-operated rats at 7, 14, or 28 days following bulbectomy or sham surgery. We observed a significant increase of whole brain ALLO content at 7 and 28 days post-surgery in the OB rats. At days 7 and 14 following olfactory bulb removal, ALLO levels were significantly decreased in amygdala and frontal cortex and significantly increased in whole cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus we observed only a tendency for decreased ALLO levels at day 14. Our data indicates a strong region-specific dysregulation of ALLO homeostasis in brains of OB rats which may contribute to the formation of the bulbectomy syndrome via a sustained reduction in physiological GABA-ergic tone in amygdala and frontal cortex.",1
30,Activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors induces long-term depression in the hippocampal CA1 region of adult rats in vitro,"Previous studies have implicated that long-term depression (LTD) was developmentally regulated since LTD can be readily induced by low frequency stimulation (LFS) in acute hippocampal slices prepared from juvenile but not adult animals. Here, we have examined the LTD induced by LFS (1Hz, 900 pulses) paired with a certain pattern at the Schaffer collateral-CAl synapse in adult hippocampal slices. We found that, in the 90-day-old rat hippocampus, LTD could be induced reliably by LFS paired with stronger stimulus intensity than that used during baseline recording. However, this synaptic depression could be completely abolished by application of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist (S)-amethyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) which had no effect on that induced by the same protocol in the 16-day-old rat hippocampus. Furthermore, preincubation with group I mGluR antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) and (S)-2-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (LY367385), also completely prevented the LFS-induced LTD. In contrast, group II mGluR antagonist (2S)-a-ethylglutamic acid (EGLU), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist APV and voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist nimodipine had no effect on the LFS-induced LTD. Taken together, these observations suggest that LFS paired with strong stimulus strength can efficiently induce group I mGluR-dependent LTD in the adult hippocampal CA1 region, proving insight into the functional significance of hippocampal mGluR-mediated LTD in learning and memory.",0
31,"Behavioral effects of intrahippocampal injections of clonidine, yohimbine and salbutamol in the rat","Intrahippocampal injections of adrenergic drugs, clonidine (an alpha 2-agonist), yohimbine (an alpha 2-antagonist), and salbutamol (a beta 2-agonist) were performed in the awake rat. The injection of a high dose of clonidine caused a depression in locomotion in the open-field. Yohimbine partially antagonized the clonidine-induced hypomotility. The intrahippocampal injection of salbutamol had no effect on ambulatory behavior of the rat. These results suggest that the role played by the anterodorsal hippocampus in modifying behavior in novel situations is dependent on the specific sub-population of adrenoceptors that is stimulated.",0
32,Losartan increases renal blood flow during isoflurane anesthesia in sheep,"Background: Inhaled anesthetics cause a transient reversible depression of renal function by direct renal effects or indirectly by changes in neurohumoral systems or cardiovascular performance. When the sympathetic nervous activity is decreased during anesthesia, other vasoactive systems like vasopressin (AVP) and particularly the renin angiotensin system (RAS) are of importance for blood pressure maintenance. Little is known about how the renal circulation is affected by angiotensin receptor blockade during isoflurane anesthesia. Methods: The study was performed on isoflurane anesthetized sheep equipped with flow probes (placed around a femoral and a renal artery) and a pulmonary artery catheter. During stable conditions the sheep were given one or more of the following substances: isotonic saline (NaCl); losartan (LOS) 10 mg x kg(-1); prazosin (PRAZ) 0.2 mg x kg(-1) and a vasopressin V1-receptor antagonist (AVP-a) 10 microg x kg(-1). Results: LOS and AVP-a did not affect mean arterial pressure (MAP), whereas PRAZ lowered MAP significantly (from 98+/-12 to 65+/-7 mmHg). Renal blood flow (RBF) increased after LOS treatment (148+/-34 to 222+/-33 ml x min(-1)). The other substances were without effect on RBF. Femoral blood flow remained unchanged after all treatments. Conclusion: We conclude that the sympathoadrenal system is still the major determinant for blood pressure maintenance during isoflurane anesthesia in sheep. The apparently increased activity of the renin angiotensin system in this situation causes a reduction in renal blood flow, which is counteracted by angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockade.",0
33,Subarachnoid hemorrhage induces dynamic changes in regional cerebral metabolism in rats,"Following a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), adult rats exhibit dynamic regional changes in cerebral glucose metabolism characterized by an increase in metabolic rates and a subsequent upregulation of cytochrome oxidase (CO). We evaluated both local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (ICMRglc: (mol/100 g/min) and CO in 23 brain regions of interest (ROI). Sham animals underwent anesthesia and superficial surgery; saline-controls received an injection of 0.9% saline into the cisterna magna; and SAH rats received an injection of autologous blood into the cisterna magna. This blood, measured by albumin labeled with radioactive carbon 14, distributed throughout the brain but predominated ventrally. After experimental animals were sacrificed at day 0 (3 h), 1, 3, and 7 days postinjection, ROI were analyzed using [14C]2-deoxy-D-glucose autoradiography and CO histochemistry. ICMRglc in SAH rats increased in many regions (ranging from 0.7% to 32.2% above sham levels). Cytochrome oxidase also increased from 1% to 9% above sham levels, peaking on day 3. Conversely, saline-controls exhibited prolonged depression of ICMRglc (ranging from 11% to 35% below sham levels) and CO (ranging from 4% to 11% below sham levels) from day 0 through day 7. All saline-control ROI for all time points showed this metabolic depression, and between 91% and 95% of saline-control ROI presented lower CO levels as compared to sham. Overall, ICMRglc and CO levels were greater in SAH than in saline-control ROI. However, when considering the influence of subarachnoid blood on metabolic changes in SAH animals, both CO and 2DG levels did not correlate well with the amount of 14C-albumin binding. While previous studies have measured both metabolic rates of glucose and CO soon after SAH, this is the first to simultaneously conduct these measurements in the same SAH rat model.",0
34,M4 Muscarinic Receptor Signaling Ameliorates Striatal Plasticity Deficits in Models of L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia,"A balanced interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling in the striatum is critical to goal-directed behavior. But how this interaction modulates corticostriatal synaptic plasticity underlying learned actions remains unclear--particularly in direct-pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs). Our studies show that in dSPNs, endogenous cholinergic signaling through M4 muscarinic receptors (M4Rs) promoted long-term depression of corticostriatal glutamatergic synapses, by suppressing regulator of G protein signaling type 4 (RGS4) activity, and blocked D1 dopamine receptor dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). Furthermore, in a mouse model of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD), boosting M4R signaling with positive allosteric modulator (PAM) blocked aberrant LTP in dSPNs, enabled LTP reversal, and attenuated dyskinetic behaviors. An M4R PAM also was effective in a primate LID model. Taken together, these studies identify an important signaling pathway controlling striatal synaptic plasticity and point to a novel pharmacological strategy for alleviating LID in PD patients.",0
35,Frequency facilitation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses of freely behaving rats contributes to the induction of persistent LTD via an adenosine-A1 receptor-regulated mechanism,"Frequency facilitation (FF), comprising a rapid and multiple-fold increase in the magnitude of evoked field potentials, is elicited by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Here, we show that in freely behaving rats, FF reliably occurs in response to 1 and 2Hz but not in response to 0.25-, 0.3-, or 0.5-Hz LFS. Strikingly, prolonged (approximately 600 s) FF was tightly correlated to the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in freely moving animals. Although LFS at 2 Hz elicited unstable FF and unstable LTD, application of LFS at 1 Hz elicited pronounced FF, as well as robust LTD that persisted for over 24 h. This correlation of prolonged FF with LTD was absent at stimulation frequencies that did not induce FF. The adenosine-A1 receptor appears to participate in these effects: Application of adenosine-A1, but not adenosine-A3, receptor antagonists enhanced mossy fiber synaptic transmission and occluded FF. Furthermore, adenosine-A1 receptor antagonism resulted in more stable FF at 1 or 2 Hz and elicited more potent LTD. These data support the fact that FF contributes to the enablement of long-term information storage at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses and that the adenosine-A1 receptor may regulate the thresholds for this process.",0
36,Relationship between elongation factor I- and elongation factor II- dependent guanosine triphosphatase activities of ribosomes. Inhibition of both activities by ricin,"The elongation factor 1- and elongation factor 2-dependent GTPase (guanosine triphosphatase) activities of ribosomes are inhibited by ricin, a toxic protein known to inactivate the 60S ribosomal subunit. It is suggested that also in eukaryotic ribosomes a 'GTPase site', located on the larger subunit, is common to the two elongation factors.",0
37,The onset of response habituation during the growth of the lateral giant neuron of crayfish,"1. The postembryonic development of the crayfish LG tailflip command neuron's response to mechanosensory input was studied with standard electrophysiological techniques in animals between 1 and 12 cm long. 2. LG neurons are present in each abdominal hemisegment where they receive direct and indirect excitatory input from mechanosensory afferents. In both small and large crayfish, electrical stimulation of an abdominal ganglionic nerve containing those afferents evoked a compound excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) with an early, reliable alpha component and a later, depression-prone beta wave. It is known that the alpha and beta components are produced by inputs from primary mechanosensory afferents and interneurons, respectively. 3. In crayfish < 2 cm long, LG was excited by the alpha component. When superthreshold, the alpha component triggered a single spike; additional excitation provided by the later beta wave presumably was preempted by refractoriness following the alpha spike and by recurrent inhibition of LG excited by the spike. LG was excited reliably by the alpha component in response to repeated superthreshold stimulation. 4. In crayfish between 2 and 3 cm, LG was excited more readily by the beta wave than by the alpha component. LG's beta spike response habituated to repeated stimulation at 1 Hz, and the beta EPSP depressed whereas the alpha component was largely unchanged. The appearance of the cellular substrates of habituation correlates with the reported onset of behavioral habituation of the tailflip response. Higher stimulus levels brought the alpha EPSP to threshold. Repetitive stimulation at these levels reliably evoked LG spikes from the alpha EPSP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
38,Graft-versus-host reaction and lymphoid organs in normally fed and protein-deprived rats,"Lymph node graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) induced by parental splenic lymphocytes inoculated into hind foot pads of F-1 hybrid rats is correlated with the state of the thymus and the spleen of the recipients. This may explain the depression of the reaction after protracted protein deprivation. Furthermore, GVHR provokes mainly in normal rats a reduction of thymus and spleen possibly due to a T-cell transfer to the grafted area.",0
39,Effects of isoproterenol on myocardial structure and function in septic rats,"In this study we sought to determine the effect of sepsis on two sequelae of prolonged (24-h) beta-agonist administration, myocardial hypertrophy and catecholamine-induced cardiotoxicity. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) or sham study groups and then further randomized to receive isoproterenol (2.4 mg. kg-1. day-1 iv) or placebo treatment. At 24 h, myocardial function was assessed by using the Langendorff isolated-heart technique or the heart processed for plain light microscopy. We found that 1) sepsis reduced contractile function, indicated by a rightward shift in the Starling curve (ANOVA with repeated measures, sepsis effect, P < 0.002); 2) sepsis-induced myocardial depression was reversed by isoproterenol treatment (isoproterenol effect, P < 0.0001); 3) sepsis reduced, but did not block, isoproterenol-induced myocardial hypertrophy (isoproterenol effect, P < 0.0001); 4) sepsis did not protect the heart from catecholamine-induced tissue injury; 5) the septic heart was protected against the effects of ischemiareperfusion (decreased postreperfusion resting tension, ANOVA with repeated measures, P < 0.01), an effect attenuated by isoproterenol treatment (P < 0.005); and 6) sepsis reduced the incidence of sustained asystole or ventricular fibrillation after ischemia-reperfusion (P < 0.05), an effect also attenuated by isoproterenol treatment (P < 0.01). We conclude that, in sepsis, beta-agonists induce changes in myocardial weight and function consistent with acute myocardial hypertrophy. These changes occur at the expense of significant tissue injury and increased sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion-induced tissue injury.",0
40,Pentobarbital depressant effects are independent of GABA receptors in auditory thalamic neurons,"Pentobarbital, a general anesthetic, has received extensive study for its ability to potentiate inhibition at GABA(A) subtype of receptors for GABA. Using whole cell current-clamp techniques and bath applications, we determined the effects of pentobarbital and GABA receptor antagonists on the membrane properties and tonic or burst firing of medial geniculate neurons in thalamic slices. Pentobarbital (0.01-200 microM) induced depressant effects in 50 of 66 neurons (76%). Pentobarbital hyperpolarized neurons by a mean of 3 mV and decreased the number of action potentials in tonic firing, evoked by current pulse injection from near the resting potential. Pentobarbital also decreased burst firing or low threshold Ca(2+)-spikes, evoked by current pulse injection into neurons at potentials hyperpolarized from rest. The blockade of tonic and burst firing, as well as low threshold Ca(2+)-spikes, was surmountable by increasing the amplitude of input current. The GABA(A) receptor antagonists, bicuculline (100 microM) and picrotoxinin (50-100 microM), did not block the depressant effects of pentobarbital (10 microM). The GABA(B) receptor antagonist, saclofen (200 microM), and GABA(C) receptor antagonist, (1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)methylphosphinate (10-50 microM), did not significantly alter the depressant effects. Pentobarbital produced excitatory effects (0.1-50 microM) on 11 neurons (17%) but had no effects on 5 neurons (7%). The excitation consisted of approximately 3 mV depolarization, increased tonic and burst firing and the rate of rise and amplitude of low threshold Ca(2+) spikes. These effects were associated with a increase in input resistance. In contrast, the depressant effects of pentobarbital correlated to a decreased input resistance measured with hyperpolarizing current pulse injection (IC(50) = 7.8 microM). Pentobarbital reduced Na(+)-dependent rectification on depolarization and lowered the slope resistance over a wide voltage range. Tetrodotoxin eliminated both Na(+)-dependent rectification and the pentobarbital-induced decrease in membrane resistance at depolarized voltages in two-thirds of the neurons. The pentobarbital-induced decrease in membrane resistance at voltages hyperpolarized from rest was not evident during co-application with Cs(+), known to block the hyperpolarization-activated rectifiers. In summary, the pentobarbital acted at low concentrations to depress thalamocortical neurons. The depression resulted from decreased rectification on depolarization, which no longer boosted potentials over threshold, and an increased conductance that shunted spike generation. The depressant effects of pentobarbital did not involve known types of GABA receptor interactions.",0
41,Effects of somatostatin on self-stimulation behaviour in rats pretreated with a receptor blocker,"The effects of somatostatin on lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation were investigated in rats pretreated with haloperidol, bicuculline, phenoxybenzamine or propranolol. Somatostatin decreased the rate of self-stimulation. Halperidol, bicuculline and phenoxybenzamine potentiated the somatostatin-induced depression of self-stimulation behaviour. Propranolol had no effect. It is suggested that dopaminergic, GABAergic and noradrenergic systems are involved in the somatostatin-induced depression of self-stimulation.",0
42,Glucocorticoid programing of the mesopontine cholinergic system,"Stress perception, response, adaptation, and coping strategies are individually distinct, and the sequel of stress and/or glucocorticoids (GCs) is also distinct between subjects. In the last years, it has become clear that early life stress is a powerful modulator of neuroendocrine stress-responsive circuits, programing intrinsic susceptibility to stress, and potentiating the appearance of stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety, and addiction. Herein we were interested in understanding how early life experiences reset the normal processing of negative stimuli, leading to emotional dysfunction. Animals prenatally exposed to GCs (in utero glucocorticoid exposure, iuGC) present hyperanxiety, increased fear behavior, and hyper-reactivity to negative stimuli. In parallel, we found a remarkable increase in the number of aversive 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations in response to an aversive cue. Considering the suggested role of the mesopontine tegmentum cholinergic pathway, arising from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT), in the initiation of 22 kHz vocalizations and hypothetically in the control of emotional arousal and tone, we decided to evaluate the condition of this circuit in iuGC animals. Notably, in a basal situation, iuGC animals present increased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression in the LDT and PPT, but not in other cholinergic nuclei, namely in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In addition, and in accordance with the amplified response to an adverse stimulus of iuGC animals, we found marked changes in the cholinergic activation pattern of LDT and PPT regions. Altogether, our results suggest a specific cholinergic pathway programing by prenatal GC, and hint that this may be of relevance in setting individual stress vulnerability threshold.",0
43,Tonic and baroreflex effects on arterial pressure and ventilation of pentobarbital and nicotine on the rat ventral medullary surface,"Unilateral aortic depressor nerve stimulation caused depression of arterial pressure (baropressure reflex) and ventilation (baro-ventilatory reflex) in urethane-anesthetized, spontaneously breathing Sprague-Dawley rats. Application of sodium pentobarbital to the ventral medullary surface (VMS) depressed baseline arterial pressure and ventilation, and attenuated the baro-pressure reflex, but not the baro-ventilatory reflex. Application of nicotine on the VMS decreased baseline arterial pressure and increased ventilation, but left both baro-pressure and baro-ventilatory reflexes unaltered. The results suggest that some of the structures that affect vasomotor tone may not be involved in the baroreflex inhibition of arterial pressure. Additionally, neither the neural structures near the VMS which modulate CO2 control of ventilation, nor those that affect tonic control of vasomotor tone are likely to be significantly involved in the baro-ventilatory reflex.",0
44,The hemodynamic effects of gamma 2-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and related melanotropins depend on the arousal potential of the rat,"In conscious rats, i.v. administered adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH-(4-10)) and gamma 2-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (gamma 2-MSH) induced a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and pulse pressure (PP). No circadian influence on these effects was observed. The structurally related peptide, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), only caused an increase in HR, which was not dose-dependent, whereas the stable ACTH-(4-9) analog, Org 2766, was without effect on these hemodynamic parameters. In rats under light urethane-induced anesthesia, which is known to maintain reflexes and sufficient sympathetic tone, gamma 2-MSH caused hemodynamic responses similar to those observed in conscious rats. In contrast, gamma 2-MSH had an opposite effect in rats under deep pentobarbital-induced anesthesia: a depressor effect combined with a slight bradycardia. A comparative study with rats of a more arousable Wistar rat substrain (Riv:TOX) and of a less excitable rat substrain (U:WU) showed that the dose-pressor response curves for ACTH-(4-10) and gamma 2-MSH were shifted to the left in the more excitable rats as compared to the in the less excitable rats. We conclude that a restricted amino acid sequence in the N-terminal part of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-molecule (gamma 2-MSH/ACTH-(4-10)-like) is responsible for the stimulating effects on the cardiovascular system and that those effects are strongly dependent on the state of arousal, i.e. sympathetic tone, of the rat. These stimulatory effects override a depressor phenomenon which can only be detected during central depression.",0
45,"Seasonality of dihydropyridine receptor binding in the heart of an anoxia-tolerant vertebrate, the crucian carp (Carassius carassius L.)","Prolonged anoxia tolerance of facultative anaerobes is based on metabolic depression and thus on controlled reduction of energy-utilizing processes. One proposed survival mechanism is the closing of ion channels to decrease energetic cost of ion pumping (Hochachka PW. Science 231: 234-241, 1986). To test this hypothesis, the involvement of L-type Ca2+ channels in seasonal anoxia tolerance of the vertebrate heart was examined by determining the number of [methyl-3H]PN200-110 (a ligand of L-type Ca2+ channel alpha-subunit) binding sites of the cardiac tissue and the density of Ca2+ current in ventricular myocytes of an anoxia-resistant fish species, the crucian carp. In their natural environment, the fish were exposed for > 3 mo of hypoxia (O2 < 2.5 mg/l) followed by almost 8 wk of anoxia that resulted in abrupt depletion of cardiac glycogen stores in late spring. Unexpectedly, however, the number of [methyl-3H]PN200-110 binding sites did not decline in hypoxia/anoxia as predicted by the channel arrest hypothesis but remained constant for most of the year. However, in early summer, the number of [methyl-3H]PN200-110 binding sites doubled for a period of approximately 2 mo, which functionally appeared as a 74% larger Ca2+ current density. Thus the anoxia tolerance of the carp heart cannot be based on downregulation of Ca2+ channel units in myocytes but is likely to depend on suppressed heart rate, i.e., regulation of the heart at the systemic level, and direct depressive effects of low temperature on Ca2+ current to achieve savings in cardiac work load and ion pumping. The summer peak in the number of functional Ca2+ channels indicates a short period of high cardiac activity possibly associated with reproduction and active perfusion of tissues after the winter stresses.",0
46,Depression of drug metabolism in the mouse by a combination of Mycobacterium butyricum and anaesthetics,"1 Subcutaneous injection of Mycobacterium butyricum suspended in mineral oil into the mouse hind paw caused an oedematous local inflammation. Hind paw swelling was maximum 5 days after injection and was still apparent at day 30. 2 Drug metabolism in vivo (as monitored by ketamine- or pentobarbitone-induced sleeping times) was not affected by the inflammatory disease. However, administration of ketamine or pentobarbitone at day 1 led to significantly elevated sleeping times when the mice showing local inflammation were retested at day 5 with the anaesthetics. 3 Indomethacin inhibited hind paw oedema in the mouse but did not affect ketamine-Mycobacterium butyricum-induced depression of drug metabolism. 4 Prolongation of ketamine-induced anaesthesia by combination with Mycobacterium butyricum at day 5 correlated with the degree of hind paw inflammation at this time. 5 The data suggest that anaesthetics (i.e., ketamine and pentobarbitone) may sensitize hepatic membranes to the effect of Mycobacterium butyricum or some toxic compound elaborated during the active phase of inflammation.",0
47,The characteristics of the effect of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and its structural fragments on the lipid peroxidation of biological membranes,"The effect of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and its structural fragments--phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline chloride--on the ascorbate-dependent mice liver microsomal lipid peroxidation (LP) has been studied at the different LP rate. At DPPC, PA and choline chloride introduction into the incubation medium before the onset of peroxidation induction DPPC causes the more considerable inhibition of LP than PA each separate fragment. The inhibition effect of DPPC is lower than PA or choline chloride when DPPC, PA and choline chloride added on the background of developing process of peroxidation (e.i. after LP induction). A specific regulatory role of PC in the normal cell membrane LP process and during pathologic development is under discussion.",0
48,The level of GABA in the brain and locomotor behavior,"GABA content was measured in the brains of animals injected with AOAA, DPA or Saline. Significant increases in GABA were found in the motor cortex and cerebellum after treatment with both drugs as compared to saline injected controls. Increased GABA levels were associated with interference with the smooth execution of locomotor acts, especially where balancing and coordination of the hind limbs were necessary.",0
49,Enhancement by an antagonist of transmitter release from frog motor nerve terminals,"1 The effect of Ba2+ on the synchronous release of acetylcholine from frog motor nerve terminals was studied by conventional electrophysiological techniques. 2 When Ca2+ and Ba2+ were the only divalent cations in the bathing fluid, Ba2+ caused a presynaptic reduction in the amplitude of the endplate potential (e.p.p.). This effect was surmountable by increasing the Ca2+ concentration. 3 The affinity constant (KA) for Ba2+, calculated on the assumption that Ba2+ is a competitive inhibitor of the agonist, Ca2+, was 1.1 +/- 0.4 mM-1 (mean +/- s.e. mean, n = 8). 4 When e.p.ps were depressed by the addition of 1 mM Mg2+, addition of Ba2+ (1 to 3 mM) caused either a further presynaptic depression of moderate magnitude or had no additional effect. 5 When e.p.p.s were depressed with [Mg2+] greater than or equal to 2 mM, addition of Ba2+ greater than or equal to 0.9 mM enhanced the e.p.p. amplitude by a presynaptic mechanism. 6 The interaction of the divalent cation antagonists Mg2+ and Ba2+ with the agonist, Ca2+ is discussed. It is demonstrated that a model which considers the nonequilibrium, kinetic properties of binding can be used to describe interactions between divalent cations at the external surface of the motor nerve ending.",0
