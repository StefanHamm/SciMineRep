Irbesartan Reduces QT Dispersion in Hypertensive Individuals,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic>
            —Angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists have direct effects on the autonomic nervous system and myocardium. Because of this, we hypothesized that irbesartan would reduce QT dispersion to a greater degree than amlodipine, a highly selective vasodilator. To test this, we gathered electrocardiographic (ECG) data from a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind parallel group study that compared the antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan and amlodipine in elderly subjects with mild to moderate hypertension. Subjects were treated for 6 months with either drug. Hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol were added after 12 weeks if blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled. ECGs were obtained before randomization and at 6 months. A total of 188 subjects (118 with baseline ECGs) were randomized. We analyzed 104 subjects who had complete ECGs at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Baseline characteristics between treatments were similar, apart from a slight imbalance in diastolic BP (irbesartan [n=53] versus amlodipine [n=51], 99.2 [SD 3.6] versus 100.8 [3.8] mm Hg;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.03). There were no significant differences in BP normalization (diastolic BP &lt;90 mm Hg) between treatments at 6 months (irbesartan versus amlodipine, 80% versus 88%;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.378). We found a significant reduction in QT indexes in the irbesartan group (QTc dispersion mean, –11.4 [34.5] milliseconds,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.02; QTc max, –12.8 [35.5] milliseconds,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.01), and QTc dispersion did not correlate with the change in BP. The reduction in QT indexes with amlodipine (QTc dispersion, –9.7 [35.4] milliseconds,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.06; QTc max, –8.6 [33.2] milliseconds,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.07) did not quite reach statistical significance, but there was a correlation between the change in QT indexes and changes in systolic BP. In conclusion, irbesartan improved QT dispersion, and this effect may be important in preventing sudden cardiac death in at-risk hypertensive subjects.

Prevalence of Gingival Overgrowth Induced by Calcium Channel Blockers: A Community‐Based Study,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> The prevalence of gingival overgrowth induced by chronic medication with calcium channel blockers is uncertain. Although there have been several studies examining this question, the results are conflicting, with previous estimates ranging from 20% to 83%. There have been only 2 studies examining the prevalence of overgrowth induced by diltiazem and amlodipine, with estimates of 74% and 3.3%, respectively.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> The current study aimed to address the problems associated with these studies by examining a sample of patients taking one of 3 calcium channel blockers, who were drawn from a community‐based population in northeastern England. Nine hundred eleven (911) subjects were recruited from general medical practices in the area. Of these, 442 were taking nifedipine, 181 amlodipine, and 186 diltiazem. In addition, 102 control subjects were examined. Drug and demographic data for each subject were recorded. The periodontal condition of all subjects was assessed including plaque index, papillary bleeding index, and a photograph of the anterior gingivae for subsequent analysis of overgrowth severity.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> More than six percent (6.3%) of subjects taking nifedipine were seen to have significant overgrowth. This overgrowth was statistically greater than the amount of overgrowth seen in either of the other 2 drug groups or the control population. The prevalence of gingival overgrowth induced by amlodipine or diltiazem was not statistically significant when compared to the control group. The severity of overgrowth within the nifedipine group was found to be related to the amount of gingival inflammation and also to the gender of the subject, with males being 3 times as likely to develop overgrowth than females.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The prevalence of clinically significant overgrowth related to chronic medication with calcium channel blockers is low, i.e., 6.3% for nifedipine. Males are 3 times as likely as females to develop clinically significant overgrowth. The presence of gingival inflammation is an important cofactor for the expression of this effect. <jats:italic>J Periodontol 1999; 70: 63‐67.</jats:italic></jats:p>",0

Effects of Long‐Acting Versus Short‐Acting Calcium Channel Blockers Among Older Survivors of Acute Myocardial Infarction,"<jats:p><jats:bold>OBJECTIVE</jats:bold>: Recent studies have highlighted the potentially harmful effects of short‐acting calcium channel blockers, especially of the dihydropyridine type, in patients with coronary heart disease. Some have argued that long‐acting calcium channel blockers are safer, but few outcome data exist. The objective of the study was to compare the occurrence of adverse outcomes among recipients of long‐acting versus short‐acting calcium channel blockers, with dihydropyridines and non‐dihydropyridines compared separately.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>SETTING</jats:bold>: The New Jersey Medicare population.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>DESIGN</jats:bold>: A retrospective cohort study using linked Medicare and drug claims data.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>PARTICIPANTS</jats:bold>: Older survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI) occurring in 1989 and 1990. Eligible subjects had survived at least 30 days after the MI, participated in Medicare and a drug benefits program, and were prescribed a single type of either a long‐acting or a short‐acting calcium channel blocker within 90 days after the MI.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>MEASUREMENTS</jats:bold>: The two outcome measures were rates of all‐cause mortality and cardiac rehospitalization. Using separate Cox regression models for dihydropyridines (nifedipine, nicardipine) and non‐dihydropyridines (diltiazem, verapamil), we examined these outcomes for recipients of long‐acting compared with short‐acting calcium channel blockers.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold>: Of the 833 patients eligible for the study, 160 were prescribed long‐acting and 673 short‐acting calcium channel blockers. Clinical characteristics of long‐acting and short‐acting users were comparable. During 2 years of follow‐up, 221 deaths and 300 rehospitalizations occurred. Controlling for age, sex, race, and indicators of disease severity and comorbidity, the relative risk of dying for recipients of long‐acting, compared with short‐acting, dihydropyridines was .42 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21‐0.86). For cardiac rehospitalization, the relative risk was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.34‐0.94). For the long‐acting versus short‐acting non‐dihydropyridines, the adjusted relative risk of dying was 1.43 (95% CI, 0.88‐2.32), and for cardiac rehospitalization, .65 (95% CI, 0.40‐1.05).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION</jats:bold>: Use of long‐acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers after acute MI was associated with substantially lower rates of cardiac rehospitalization and death compared with use of their short‐acting counterparts. More data are needed to address the possibility that long‐acting, compared with short‐acting, non‐dihydropyridines could decrease rehospitalization rates but increase mortality.

Combination of calcium channel blockers and <i>β</i>‐adrenoceptor blockers for patients with exercise‐induced angina pectoris: a double‐blind parallel‐group comparison of different classes of calcium channel blockers,"<jats:p> <jats:italic>
            
						Aims</jats:italic> The combination of calcium channel blockers and β‐adrenoceptor blockers is more effective for the treatment of exercise‐induced angina pectoris than β‐adrenoceptor blocker monotherapy. As ischaemia in exercise‐induced angina is preceded by increase in heart rate, calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic properties may perform better for this purpose than nonchronotropic compounds.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>
            
						Methods</jats:italic> A 335 patient double‐blind parallel‐group study comparing 14 day treatment with amlodipine 5 and 10 mg, with diltiazem 200 and 300 mg, and mibefradil 50 and 100 mg added to baseline β‐adrenoceptor blocker treatment was performed. Exercise testing (ETT) was performed by bicycle ergometry.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>
            
						Results Although none of the calcium channel blockers improved duration of exercise or amount of workload, all significantly delayed onset of 1 mm ST‐segment depression on ETT (P&lt;0.001 for any treatment vs baseline). In addition, mibefradil, both low and high dose treatment, produced the longest delays (low dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 24.1 and 29.8 s, respectively, P&lt;0.003 and &lt;0.001; high dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 33.7 and 37.0 s, respectively, P&lt;0.001 and &lt;0.001). These effects were linearly correlated with the reduction in rate pressure product (RPP). Serious symptoms of dizziness occurred significantly more frequently on mibefradil (P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05), and 19 patients on mibefradil withdrew from trial.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>
            
						Conclusions</jats:italic> Calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic properties provide greater delay of ischaemia in patients with exercise‐induced angina, but the concomitant risk of intolerable dizziness attenuates this benefit.</jats:p>",0
Retrospective analysis of the frequency and recognition of adverse drug reactions by means of automatically recorded laboratory signals,"<jats:p> <jats:italic>
            
						Aims</jats:italic> To estimate the frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified through the use of automatic signals generated from laboratory data (ALS) in hospitalised patients. To determine the frequency of spontaneous recognition of these ADRs by the attending physicians and to assess the potential value of ALS for detection of ADRs.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>
            
						Methods</jats:italic> Laboratory results of patients hospitalised in a nine bed medical ward were automatically recorded over a period of 17 months. Values exceeding defined boundaries were used as ALS. Charts of every third patient were analysed retrospectively with regard to adverse drug related reactions and causality was evaluated as well as whether the ADR had been recognised during the period of hospitalisation.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>
            
						Results</jats:italic> The charts and ALS of 98 patients were analysed. In 18 cases a drug‐related adverse reaction was probable. Awareness to the reaction by the treating physicians was evident in 6 out of these 18 ADRs. Approximately 80% of the ADRs were considered predictable. Three ADRs were regarded as serious.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>
            
						Conclusions</jats:italic> Adverse drug reactions are common and often preventable. Only one third of ADRs which could have been detected through ALS were recognised by the attending physicians. An increased doctor’s awareness of the frequency of drug related abnormal laboratory results by means of ALS is likely to increase the recognition rate of ADRs and might help to prevent them.</jats:p>",0

Combination of Calcium Channel Blockers and Beta Blockers for Patients with Exercise-Induced Angina Pectoris: A Double-Blind Parallel-Group Comparison of Different Classes of Calcium Channel Blockers,"<jats:p> The combination of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers is more effective for the treatment of exercise-induced angina pectoris than beta blocker monotherapy. Since ischemia in exercise-induced angina is essentially preceded by an increase in heart rate, calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic property may perform better for this purpose than nonchronotropic compounds. A 335-patient, 10-week, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of amlodipine 5 and 10 mg, diltiazem XR 200 and 300 mg, and mibefradil 50 and 100 mg treatment added to baseline beta blocker treatment was performed. Exercise testing (ETT) was performed by bicycle ergometry. </jats:p><jats:p> Although none of the calcium channel blockers improved duration of exercise or amount of workload, all of them significantly delayed onset of 1 mm ST segment depres sion on ETT (p&lt;0.001 for any treatment versus baseline). In addition, mibefradil, both low- and high-dose treatment, produced the largest delays (low dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 24.1 and 29.8 s, p&lt;0.003 and &lt;0.001, respectively; high (continued on next page) dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 33.7 and 37.0 s, p&lt;0.001 and &lt;0.001, respectively). These effects were linearly correlated to the amount of rate pressure product (RPP) reduction. Serious symptoms of dizziness likewise occurred significantly more frequently with mibefradil (p&lt;0.05) and led 19 patients taking mibefradil to withdraw from the trial. </jats:p><jats:p> The authors conclude that calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic property provide better delay of ischemia in patients with exercise-induced angina but that the concomitant risk of intolerable dizziness largely reduces this benefit. </jats:p>",0

Effect of amlodipine on exercise‐induced platelet activation in patients affected by chronic stable angina,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Background:</jats:italic> Literature concerning exercise‐induced platelet activation in chronic stable angina is somewhat confusing. The reason lies in the type of exercise as well as in methodological problems. A powerful, recently introduced procedure to detect platelet activation is flow cytometry. Platelet response to activating factors is mediated by calcium uptake; however, calcium antagonist effect on platelet activity is still unclear.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Hypothesis:</jats:italic> The study was undertaken to investigate exercise‐induced platelet activation before and after treatment with amlodipine in chronic stable angina.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Methods:</jats:italic> Twenty patients with chronic stable angina were entered into the study. Each subject underwent a symptom‐limited cycloergometer stress test following a washout period of 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after exercise. All subjects were then randomized into two groups of 10 patients each, with Group 1 and Group 2 taking amlodipine 10 mg/day, and placebo for 4 weeks, respectively. They subsequently underwent a second exercise stress test, and blood samples were obtained before and immediately after exercise. Flow‐cytometric evaluation of platelet activity was performed in order to recognize GMP‐140 expression on platelet membrane.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Results:</jats:italic> Strenuous exercise induced a significant increase in platelet activation in all subjects prior to therapy.

Initiation of Atrial Fibrillation by Ectopic Beats Originating From the Pulmonary Veins,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Background</jats:italic>
            —Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be initiated by ectopic beats originating from the atrial or great venous tissues. This study investigated the anatomic characteristics and electrophysiological properties of pulmonary veins (PVs), as well as the possible mechanisms and response to drugs of ectopic foci, and assessed the effects of radiofrequency (RF) ablation on AF initiated by ectopic beats originating from PVs.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            —Seventy-nine patients with frequent episodes of paroxysmal AF and 10 control patients were included. Distal PVs showed the shortest effective refractory periods (ERPs), and right superior PVs showed a higher incidence of intra-PV conduction block than left superior PVs. Superior and left PVs had longer myocardial sleeves than inferior and right PVs, respectively. These electrophysiological characteristics were similar between AF and control patients. Propranolol, verapamil, and procainamide suppressed ectopic beats that originated from the PVs. Of 116 ectopic foci that initiated AF, 103 (88.8%) originated from PVs. A mean of 7±3 RF applications completely eliminated 110 ectopic foci (94.8%). During the 6±2-month follow-up period, 68 patients (86.1%) were free of AF without any antiarrhythmic drugs. Follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram showed 42.4% of ablated PVs had focal stenosis. One patient had mild exertional dyspnea after ablation, but it resolved 3 months later; 1 patient had onset of mild exertional dyspnea 5 months after ablation.

            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            —Electrophysiological characteristics of PVs are different from those in the atria. Ectopic beats from PVs can initiate AF, and β-adrenergic receptor blocker, calcium channel blockers, and sodium channel blockers can suppress these ectopic beats. Careful mapping and elimination of these ectopic foci can cure paroxysmal AF.

Use of calcium‐channel blockers in pediatric renal transplant recipients,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract:</jats:bold> Hypertension (HTN) is a significant problem in pediatric renal transplant (TP) recipients, predisposing the individuals to the development of cardiovascular disease and graft dysfunction. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are considered excellent agents to treat post‐TP HTN. We compared the efficacy and adverse effects of the two most commonly prescribed CCBs in our pediatric renal TP population: nifedipine (Procardia<jats:sup>R</jats:sup>, or P) and amlodipine (Norvasc<jats:sup>R</jats:sup>, or N)<jats:italic>.</jats:italic> All patients (n = 24) had been started on a CCB for systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) &gt; 95%. There were no other changes in adjunctive antihypertensive medications or doses during the cross‐over period. Post‐TP, pretreatment (pretx) SBP was 137.6 ± 10.9 mmHg. The post‐treatment SBP were (in mmHg): 128.5 ± 11.9 (all patients, n = 24) (p = 0.009 vs. pretx); 126.4 ± 10.0 (P alone, n = 15) (p = 0.007 vs. pretx); 132.8 ± 14.4 (P + other antihypertensive(s), n = 9) (p = 0.331, NS vs. pretx). The post‐TP, pretreatment DBP was 88.2 ± 11.1 mmHg. The post‐treatment DBP were (in mmHg): 78.5 ± 6.9 (all patients, n = 24) (p = 0.03 vs. pretx); 77.2 ± 7.4 (P alone, n = 15) (p = 0.008 vs. pretx); 80.7 ± 6.1(P + other antihypertensive(s), n = 9) (p = 0.063, NS vs. pretx). P and N were equally effective in reducing SBP (p = 0.843, NS) and DBP (p = 0.612, NS). Cyclosporin A (CyA) dose (p = 0.81) and trough levels (p = 0.19) were similar in P‐ and N‐treated patients. Calculated GFR was virtually identical in P‐ and N‐treated patients (p = 0.89). Patients (or parents of) reported a higher incidence of various side‐effects while receiving P, including headache, flushing, dizziness and leg cramps. Furthermore, 22/24 (91.7%) reported some degree of gingival hyperplasia during treatment with P, and all these patients reported a stabilization or reduction of hypertrophy after the switch from P to N. We conclude that CCBs (N) are efficacious drugs for the purpose of BP control and renal protection in pediatric renal TP recipients.</jats:p>",0

            <jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic>
            —Calcium channel blockers  (CCBs) blunt postural skin vasoconstriction, an autoregulatory  mechanism that minimizes gravitational increases in capillary pressure  and avoids fluid extravasation when standing. To evaluate the  dose-response relation between this pharmacological interference and  dependent edema, a frequent side effect of CCBs during antihypertensive  treatment, skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry) at the  dorsum of the foot, both supine and with the limb passively placed 50  cm below the heart level, and leg weight (Archimedes principle) were  measured at baseline, during increasing doses of the  dihydropyridine amlodipine (5 and 10 mg UID  each for 2 weeks), and after drug withdrawal in 10 hypertensive men.  Because angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitors may attenuate ankle swelling by CCBs, those  parameters were evaluated according to a similar design  during amlodipine (10 mg UID) and enalapril (20 mg UID) combined  (n=10). As a control, the effect of enalapril monotherapy (10 and 20 mg  UID for 2 weeks each) was evaluated in a third series of patients  (n=8). Amlodipine (5 mg UID) increased leg weight without modifying  postural vasoconstriction (the percent skin blood flow decrease from  horizontal to dependent position), which indicates that extravascular  fluid shift was independent of postural skin vasoconstriction. At 10 mg  UID, however, amlodipine blunted postural vasoconstriction and  increased leg weight further, which suggests that skin blood flow  autoregulation limited additional fluid transfer. Both  parameters normalized after drug withdrawal. Enalapril per  se did not affect cutaneous vasomotion or leg weight but reduced the  amount of dependent fluid extravasation by the CCB despite a persistent  antagonism for postural vasoconstrictor responses.

Esophageal Motility Disorders: Current Concepts of Pathogenesis and Treatment,"<jats:p>Current concepts of esophageal motility disorders are summarized. Primary data sources were located via MEDLINE or cross-citation. No attempt was made to be comprehensive or inclusive of the literature because fewer than 10% of citations are discussed. Instead, emphasis was placed on new developments in diagnosis, therapeutics, and practice patterns. Controlled therapeutic trials and pathophysiological observations are emphasized. Achalasia is a rare disease of failed lower sphincter relaxation and aperistalsis. Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), an equally rare disease, is defined by non-propagated esophageal contractions. Nonspecific motility disorders, including nutcracker esophagus and hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter, are identified only by manometry and are ten times as prevalent. Neuromuscular pathology is evident only with achalasia (myenteric plexus neurons destruction). Pharmacological therapies have limited efficacy with achalasia; more limited with DES; and none with the nonspecific motility disorders. More efficacious therapies for the nonspecific disorders are directed at associated reflux disease or psychiatric disorders. Pneumatic dilation is effective therapy for achalasia 72% of instances, but frequently requires repeat dilation and is complicated by a 3% perforation rate. Surgical myotomy is effective in 88% of achalasics; morbidity from thoracotomy has been the major limitation but this has been sharply reduced with a laparoscopic approach. In conclusion, although it has been suggested that esophageal motility disorders are distinct clinical entities, critical review of the literature supports this only in the case of achalasia, a disease of well defined pathophysiology, functional disturbance, and therapies. This clarity diminishes progressively for DES and non-specific esophageal motility disorders.</jats:p>",0

Influence of Diabetes and Type of Hypertension on Response to Antihypertensive Treatment,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic>
            —The aim of our  investigation was to determine whether the presence of additional risk  factors or type of hypertension (diastolic or isolated  systolic) influences blood pressure (BP) response to treatment.  The International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a  Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) study is a double-blinded  outcome comparison of calcium channel blockade with diuretics  in high-risk patients aged 55 to 80 years. Dynamic randomization  between nifedipine once daily and  hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride was performed to ensure  that approximately equal numbers of patients in the 2 groups had each  of the major cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with  isolated systolic hypertension were also separately randomized.  Atenolol or enalapril was the mandatory second-line drug. In 5669  patients who completed the 18-week titration, BP fell from  172±15/99±9 mm Hg (mean±SD) while receiving placebo to  139±12/82±7 mm Hg. Twenty-six percent of patients required 2  drugs, and 4% required 3 drugs. Patients with diabetes were the most  resistant to treatment, requiring second and third drugs 40%  and 100% more frequently than patients without diabetes and achieving  marginally the highest final BP, for any risk group, of  141±13/82±8 mm Hg. Age, smoking, gender,  hypercholesterolemia, left  ventricular hypertrophy, and existing  atherosclerosis had little (&lt;1 mm Hg) or no  influence on BP at the end of titration, but all except smoking  slightly reduced the initial response of either systolic or  diastolic BP. Patients with isolated systolic  hypertension were slightly more responsive than average to treatment.  Our findings suggest that in patients at high absolute risk of  cardiovascular complications from hypertension, the  risk factors themselves do not prevent the recommended BP targets from  being achieved.

"Evaluation of amlodipine, lisinopril, and a combination in the treatment of essential hypertension","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists are well established and widely used as monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Earlier studies combining short acting drugs from these classes require multiple dosing and were associated with poor compliance. Availability of longer acting compounds allows once daily administration to avoid the inconvenience of a multiple daily dose. It was decided to perform a randomised double blind, crossover study with the long acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the long acting ACE inhibitor lisinopril, given either alone or in combination in essential hypertension. Twenty four patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 104 mm Hg received amlodipine 2.5 mg and 5 mg, lisinopril 5 mg and 10 mg, and their combination as per a prior randomisation schedule. Supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at weekly intervals. Higher doses of both the drugs individually or in combination were used if the target supine DBP below 90 mm Hg was not achieved. There was a significant additional blood pressure lowering effect with the combination when compared either with amlodipine or lisinopril alone. Five mg amlodipine and 10 mg lisinopril monotherapy achieved the target blood pressure in 71% and 72% patients respectively. The combination of 2.5 mg amlodipine with 5 mg lisinopril produced a much more significant lowering of blood pressure in a higher percentage of patients than that with an individual low dose.</jats:p>",0

We conducted a follow‐up study with a nested case‐control analysis of 322 448 subjects who received antihypertensive drugs. Cases were people who had a first‐time diagnosis of aplastic anaemia during January 1, 1988 through September 30, 1997. The risk estimate of aplastic anaemia was calculated for all antihypertensive drugs.

            <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>
          </jats:bold> There were 13 cases of newly diagnosed idiopathic aplastic anaemia. The estimated risk of aplastic anaemia per 100 000 users was 0.8 (95% CI 0.1, 4.7) for calcium channel blockers, 1.4 (95% CI 0.5, 4.1) for β‐adrenoceptor blockers, 2.3 (95% CI 0.6, 8.6) for angiotension‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 5.9 (95% CI 1.6, 21.5) for users of other antihypertensive drugs. In the case‐control analysis of 13 cases and 77 controls, the odds ratio was 0.3 (95% CI 0.02, 3.3) for calcium channel blockers, 0.5 (95% CI 0.1, 2.5) for β‐adrenoceptor blockers, 0.7 (95% CI 0.1, 5.6) for ACE inhibitors, 1.2 (95% CI 0.1, 11.8) for users of other antihypertensive drugs and 0.7 (95% CI 0.1, 7.2) for users of multiple drugs with a calcium channel blocker compared with nonusers.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>

The Use of Calcium Salts in the Prevention and Management of Verapamil-Induced Hypotension,"<jats:sec><jats:title>OBJECTIVE:</jats:title><jats:p> To review the available literature on the use of intravenous calcium salts for the prevention of hypotension associated with intravenous verapamil. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>METHODS:</jats:title><jats:p> A MEDLINE search (1966–June 1999) identified pertinent articles; references from these articles were identified to serve as additional resources. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>DISCUSSION:</jats:title><jats:p> Verapamil is effective in inhibiting atrioventricular nodal conduction, thereby controlling ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter and terminating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. However, hypotension may be caused by the negative inotropic and vasodilating effects of verapamil. In vitro and animal data suggest that calcium pretreatment may minimize the effects of verapamil on cardiac output and blood pressure. Case reports suggest that intravenous calcium may be useful for both prevention and reversal of the hemodynamic effects of verapamil. A number of small clinical trials have been performed, suggesting that calcium administered prior to intravenous verapamil results in a decreased incidence of hypotension. The most common adverse effect of intravenous calcium is flushing. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:title><jats:p> Calcium pretreatment prior to intravenous calcium-channel blocker administration should be considered in patients in whom further reductions in blood pressure may precipitate hypoperfusion or worsen underlying cardiovascular status. A dose of calcium gluconate 1 g (ionized calcium 90 mg) administered over three minutes is recommended for preventing or lessening the hypotensive effect of verapamil without affecting the antiarrhythmic effects of verapamil. </jats:p></jats:sec>",0

"Clinical trials update: OPTIME‐CHF, PRAISE‐2, ALL‐HAT","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This is a summary of reports of presentation made at the American College of Cardiology 49th Scientific Sessions, Anaheim, 12–15 March 2000. Studies with a particular interest for heart failure physicians have been reviewed. OPTIME‐CHF: Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure. OPTIME‐CHF was a randomised‐controlled trial comparing a 48‐h infusion of Milrinone or standard therapy in 951 patients recruited over a 2‐year period. Patients were excluded if the investigator believed their clinical condition mandated inotropic therapy. Patients were randomised within 48 h of admission for an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure to receive Milrinone or placebo infision for 48 h. Of the patients 43% were diabetics, 70% were receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, 25% were already on a beta‐Blocker, and 34% had atrial fibrillation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay during the index admission, subsequent readmissions and days in hospital over the following 60 days. Subjective clinical assessment scores were also no different. There was an average admission rate over the next year of one per patient in both groups. However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of sustained hypotension in the Milrinone group, which accounted for all of the increased adverse event rates for the active therapy. The 60‐day mortality was 10% in both groups. This and previous trials of the oral formulation of Milrinone have now clearly demonstrated a lack of benefit with Milrinone in either during acute exacerbations of or in stable severe chronic heart failure [Packer M, Carver JR, Rodeheffer RJ et al. Effect of oral Milrinone on mortality in severe chronic heart failure. N Engl J Med 1991;325:1468–1475.]. Medium sized studies of Milrinone in patients with milder severities of heart failure also suggested an adverse impact on prognosis in the presence or absence of digoxin [DiBianco R, Shabetai R, Kostuk W, Moran J, Schlant RC, Wright R. A comparison of oral Milrinone, digoxin, and their combination in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. N Engl J Med 1989;320:677–683.]. Whether Milrinone even has a role for the management of a haemodyamic crisis requiring inotropic therapy must also be questioned.</jats:p>",0

Effect of Enalapril and Nifedipine on Orthostatic Hypotension in Older Hypertensive Patients,"<jats:p>OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of enalapril with long‐acting nifedipine on orthostatic hypotension in older patients.</jats:p><jats:p>DESIGN: A prospective, double blinded, cross‐over study.</jats:p><jats:p>SETTING: The outpatient clinic of a university hospital.</jats:p><jats:p>PARTICIPANTS: Thirty‐nine patients aged 65 years or older with systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140–190 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90–110 mm Hg.</jats:p><jats:p>INTERVENTION: Enalapril 5–20 mg od or nifedipine 30–90 mg od for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks washout and cross‐over for a second 8‐week period.</jats:p><jats:p>MEASUREMENTS: Supine and standing 0‐, 1‐, and 5‐minutes blood pressure was recorded before and at the end of each treatment period.</jats:p><jats:p>RESULTS: At baseline, SBP was 158.8 ± 8.7 mm Hg, and DBP was 97.1 ± 5.9 mm Hg. There was a decline in SBP of 6.1 ± 2.7 mm Hg and 8.4 ± 4.1 mm Hg after 1 and 5 minutes of standing, respectively.</jats:p><jats:p>Both agents caused a significant decline in supine blood pressure. Enalapril: supine SBP 158.8 ± 8.7 to 143 ± 7.3 mm Hg; supine DBP 97.1 ± 5.9 to 85.1 ± 5.1 mm Hg (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .0001). The drop in SBP after standing for 5 minutes was only 2.4 ± 1.6 mm Hg with no change in diastolic values. A ≥ 10 mm Hg drop in SBP was observed in only three patients, and no patient experienced a decline of 20 mm Hg or more. Nifedipine: supine SBP: 160.3 ± 9 to 145.3 ± 8.1 mm Hg; supine DBP: 96.3 ± 5.7 to 86.3 ± 5.8 (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .0001). Nifedipine induced an orthostatic decline in SBP values; there was an 8.7 ± 4.8 mm Hg difference between supine and 5 minutes standing values (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .0005) without change in diastolic values. An orthostatic decline in SBP of ≥ 10 mm Hg occurred in 13 patients, and there was a drop of ≥ 20 mm Hg in six patients. The cross‐over of enalapril and nifedipine reproduced the hypotensive effect and reversed the postural effect. (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .0002 nifedipine vs enalapril)</jats:p><jats:p>CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril and nifedipine were equipotent in reducing supine blood pressure levels. Enalapril also reduced the number of orthostatic episodes significantly, whereas nifedipine aggravated this phenomenon. <jats:bold>J Am Geriatr Soc 48:807–810, 2000</jats:bold>.</jats:p>",0

            <jats:italic>Background</jats:italic>
            —The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of antihypertensive therapy on clinic (CBP) and ambulatory (ABP) blood pressures, on ECG voltages, and on the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular events in older patients with sustained and nonsustained systolic hypertension.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            —Patients who were ≥60 years old, with systolic CBP of 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic CBP of &lt;95 mm Hg, were randomized into the double-blind placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial. Treatment consisted of nitrendipine, with the possible addition of enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, or both. Patients enrolled in the Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Side Project were classified according to daytime systolic ABP into 1 of 3 subgroups: nonsustained hypertension (&lt;140 mm Hg), mild sustained hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg), and moderate sustained hypertension (≥160 mm Hg). At baseline, patients with nonsustained hypertension had smaller ECG voltages (

Modulation of tear film protein secretion with phosphodiesterase inhibitors,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>A double‐blind randomized clinical study was conducted to determine whether nicardipine hydrochloride was a useful treatment for dry eye. We examined its effect on the tear film, ocular surface and ocular comfort. Nicardipine hydrochloride, 3‐isobutyl‐1‐methylxanthine and pilocarpine hydrochloride were dissolved in an artificial tear vehicle and applied topically to one eye of 12 subjects on separate days. Ocular physiology, ocular comfort and tear volume were assessed. The trial was repeated with nicardipine in an aqueous gel vehicle. Tears were collected and assessed for protein concentration and protein profile, using electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Nicardipine induced conjunctival redness and symptoms of dryness and irritation. There was no change in total tear protein concentration or volume. An increase in a 68 kDa protein was observed, this was probably due to conjunctival vessel dilation and leakage of albumin. The adverse symptomatology and increased conjunctival redness experienced with nicardipine make it an undesirable treatment for dry eye.</jats:p>",0

Efficacy of Candesartan Cilexetil Alone or in Combination With Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide in Moderate-to-Severe Hypertension,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic>
            —This multicenter study  evaluated the efficacy of candesartan cilexetil, an  angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, used  alone or in combination with amlodipine or in combination with  amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of  patients with moderate-to-severe essential hypertension. After a  2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients entered a  12-week, open-label, dose-titration period. The candesartan cilexetil  dose was increased from 8 to 16 mg once daily; amlodipine (5 mg once  daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily), and  additional medication were also added sequentially if necessary.  Patients then entered a final 4-week, parallel-group, double-blind,  randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal period of candesartan alone.  A total of 216 patients were recruited. After a 2-week run-in period on  placebo tablets, mean sitting blood pressure (BP) was 175/108  mm Hg. At the end of the 12-week dose-titration/maintenance  period, mean sitting BP fell to 141/88 mm Hg. In 67 patients who  were randomized to placebo and had their candesartan withdrawn, there  was a highly significant increase in mean  systolic/diastolic BP (13/6 mm Hg) compared  with those patients who continued with candesartan (ANCOVA,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.0001). In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil is an  effective BP-lowering drug when used alone or in combination with  amlodipine or amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide in  the treatment of moderate-to-severe essential hypertension. The drug  was well tolerated throughout the investigation period.

End points were changes in average systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) from the two clinic visits before and after conversion. In addition, data were collected and analyzed with regard to adverse drug reactions, average dosage of the alternative calcium channel blocker, number of additional antihypertensives begun or discontinued, and number of dosage changes in antihypertensives within the two visits after conversion, and the overall cost impact of conversion. Average systolic blood pressure was reduced from 141.6 ± 15.1 to 139.2 ± 15.3 mm Hg after the conversion (NS). Average diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced from 74 ± 9.5 to 72.6 ± 10.1 mm Hg after conversion (p=0.032), as was MAP (97.0 ± 9.3 to 94.8 ± 10.0 mm Hg, p=0.026). Five patients had other changes in therapy made concurrently at the time of conversion, and 19 had changes after conversion. When these patients were excluded from analysis, the reduction in systolic blood pressure after conversion was significant (141.4 ± 14.5 to 137.7 ± 14.3 mm Hg, p=0.022), as were reductions in diastolic blood pressure (74.4 ± 9.4 to 71.7 ± 9.8 mm Hg, p=0.014) and MAP (96.7 ± 9.1 to 93.7 ± 9.3 mm Hg, p=0.007). Of patients who had postconversion changes in therapy, 8 (42%) were converted to diltiazem ER, nifedipine CC, or doses of felodipine that were 50% of the original dose of amlodipine. The overall cost impact of the conversion was a net savings of $14,858/year for each 100 patients converted.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion.</jats:bold> Conversion from amlodipine to other calcium channel blockers resulted in statistically significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure and MAP, and was safe as well as cost‐effective. Conversion to calcium channel antagonists other than felodipine or less than equal dosages of felodipine may require dosage titration. When converting patients from amlodipine, dosages usually should be equal to those of felodipine; if converting to other calcium channel antagonists, the need for adjustments should be anticipated.</jats:p>",0

Effect of Amlodipine on the Progression of Atherosclerosis and the Occurrence of Clinical Events,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Background</jats:italic>
            —The results of angiographic studies have suggested that calcium channel–blocking agents may prevent new coronary lesion formation, the progression of minimal lesions, or both.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            —The Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT) was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial designed to test whether amlodipine would slow the progression of early coronary atherosclerosis in 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. The primary outcome was the average 36-month angiographic change in mean minimal diameters of segments with a baseline diameter stenosis of 30%. A secondary hypothesis was whether amlodipine would reduce the rate of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries as assessed with B-mode ultrasonography, which measured intimal-medial thicknesses (IMT). The rates of clinical events were also monitored. The placebo and amlodipine groups had nearly identical average 36-month reductions in the minimal diameter: 0.084 versus 0.095 mm, respectively (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.38). In contrast, amlodipine had a significant effect in slowing the 36-month progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis: the placebo group experienced a 0.033-mm increase in IMT, whereas there was a 0.0126-mm decrease in the amlodipine group (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.007). There was no treatment difference in the rates of all-cause mortality or major cardiovascular events, although amlodipine use was associated with fewer cases of unstable angina and coronary revascularization.

          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            —Amlodipine has no demonstrable effect on angiographic progression of coronary atherosclerosis or the risk of major cardiovascular events but is associated with fewer hospitalizations for unstable angina and revascularization.

Effects of a Slow-Release Nifedipine on 24-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Ischemic Changes on 24-Hour Ambulatory Electrocardiogram in Patients with Severe Coronary Artery Disease,"<jats:p>Calcium antagonists have long been used as first-line drugs for hypertension and angina. However, deleterious effects have also been reported in patients treated with calcium antagonists. Thus, we evaluated the effect of a slow-release twice-daily formulation of nifedipine in 10 patients with severe coronary artery disease. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) and blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were performed simultaneously to detect any association between ischemic episodes on the ECG and changes in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate with and without nifedipine. Increased oxygen demand due to an increased systolic BP and heart rate was associated with ischemic episodes without nifedipine, while those with nifedipine were accompanied by a fall in diastolic BP and a rapid increase in heart rate. This slow-release twice-daily formulation of nifedipine may induce myocardial ischemia through a heart-rate increase and a decrease in coronary blood flow due to lower diastolic BP in patients with severe coronary artery disease. A once-daily formulation of nifedipine might be of great value for such patients.</jats:p>",0

Silent ischemic interval on exercise test is a predictor of response to drug therapy: A randomized crossover trial of metoprolol versus diltiazem in stable angina,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Background and hypothesis: There is no method available to predict the relative antianginal efficacy of beta blockers and calcium‐channel antagonists. The present study was undertaken to assess the role of silent ischemic interval (SII) on exercise treadmill test (ETT) as a predictor of response to therapy with metoprolol and diltiazem in patients with stable angina.</jats:p><jats:p>Methods: Thirty‐four patients with stable angina were divided into two groups depending upon the presence or absence of an SII gap of at least 1 min between onset of ST depression and appearance of angina on ETT. Metoprolol (50–100 mg twice daily) and diltiazem (60–120 mg three times daily) were randomly assigned for 6 weeks to patients in each group, and then patients were crossed over for further 6 weeks after a washout period of 2 weeks. Antianginal efficacy was assessed by clinical and exercise parameters.</jats:p><jats:p>Results: In patients with SII, the clinical responder rate was better with metoprolol than with diltiazem (90 vs. 60%, respectively), and on ETT, metoprolol produced significant improvement in the total exercise time (p&lt;0.01), time to 1 mm ST depression (p &lt; 0.01), time to angina (p &lt; 0.01), and a significant decrease in peak rate‐pressure product (p&lt;0.001), whereas diltiazem had no significant effect on exercise parameters. However, in patients without SII, metoprolol and diltiazem had a similar clinical responder rate (57%), and both produced a significant increase in total exercise time (p &lt; 0.01), time to 1 mm ST depression (p &lt; 0.01), and time to angina (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, metoprolol had a significant effect on peak rate‐pressure product (p &lt; 0.001).</jats:p><jats:p>Conclusion: Silent ischemic interval on ETT can be a predictor of response to antianginal therapy in stable angina, as patients with SII respond better to metoprolol and those without SII respond equally to both metoprolol and diltiazem.</jats:p>",0

Participants were divided into four categories depending on their triglyceride levels: I = &lt; 100 mg/dl (282 men, 400 women), II = 100–139 mg/dl (204 men, 228 women), III = 140–212 mg/dl (188 men, 180 women), and IV = ≥ 212 mg/dl (155 men, 99 women).</jats:p><jats:p>Results: After adjustment for age, high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, smoking, and body mass index by logistic regression analysis, and after assigning the CHD risk of 1 to Category I, the relative risk for men and women combined rose to 1.42 in Category III (p&lt;0.045) while it diminished to 0.94 in Category IV (p = 0.79). In women, the odds ratio (OR) rose gradually up to 1.78 (p &lt; 0.025) in Category III, only to decline in Category IV. The OR in men was slightly, insignificantly, and equally elevated in Categories III and IV. Patients with CHD in Category III were not distinguished from those in Category IV by the studied risk parameters. It was suggested that high risk for CHD—particularly in subjects with slightly elevated or normal cholesterol levels—is often not reflected by extreme increases of fasting triglycerides but best by modest elevations (140–212 mg/dl), which serve better as a marker of triglyceride‐rich lipoprotein particles. This knowledge may prove to be of value in population screening and individual risk assessment.</jats:p>",0

"<i>Hypothesis:</i>
            β-Adrenergic Receptor Blockers and Weight Gain","<jats:p>One  of the arguments put forward against the primary use of β-blockers  has been concern about adverse metabolic effects, such as  unfavorable effects on lipids or insulin sensitivity. Another  less-appreciated potential drawback is their propensity to cause weight  gain in some patients. In 8 evaluable prospective randomized controlled  trials that lasted ≥6 months, body weight was higher in the  β-blocker than in the control group at the end of the study. The  median difference in body weight was 1.2 kg (range −0.4 to 3.5 kg). A  regression analysis suggested that β-blockers were associated  with an initial weight gain during the first few months. Thereafter, no  further weight gain compared with controls was apparent. There was no  relationship between demographic characteristics and changes in body  weight. Based on these observations, the first-line use of β-blockers  in obese hypertensive patients should be reviewed. Obesity management  in overweight hypertensive patients may be more difficult in the face  of β-blocker treatment.</jats:p>",0

Nifedipine and Nimodipine Competitively Inhibit Uridine Kinase and Orotidine-Phosphate Decarboxylase: Theoretical Relevance to Poor Outcome in Stroke,"<jats:p> Nifedipine and nimodipine, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, are commonly used as antihypertensive and antianginal agents in patients at risk for stroke. At least one stroke trial suggests that patients receiving calcium channel blockers at the time of an acute stroke have worse outcomes than those receiving other or no antihypertensive medications. We hypothesize that the poor outcome may not be related to blood pressure changes but instead may be mediated by competitive inhibition of important enzymes of pyrimidine synthesis whose products are needed to repair nerve cell membranes after an acute stroke. Both drugs acted as competitive inhibitors of the only enzymes that are known to synthesize the nucleotide uridine-5′-phosphate: uridine kinase and orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase. Nifedipine produced Ki values of 28 (μM for uridine kinase and 105 μM for orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase. Nimodipine produced Ki values of 20 μM for uridine kinase and 18 μM for orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase. For uridine kinase, these inhibitors bound more tightly than the physiologic substrates uridine or cytidine. For the decarboxylase, the inhibitors bound less tightly than the normal physiologic substrate orotidine-5′-phosphate. Additional experiments are needed to determine whether the concentrations of nifedipine or nimodipine, and of cytidine, uridine, and orotidine-5′-phosphate in human brain, are such that this inhibition would affect stroke outcome. </jats:p>",0

Macrophages and Lymphocyte Subpopulations in Nifedipine‐ and Cyclosporin A‐Associated Human Gingival Overgrowth,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Nifedipine and cyclosporin A (CsA) induce gingival overgrowth. Both drugs have immunomodulating effects. It has been suggested that altered immune response is associated with drug‐induced gingival overgrowth. In this study, we evaluated whether there were differences in macrophages and lymphocyte subpopulations in human nifedipine‐ and CsA‐associated gingival overgrowth as compared with those in normal gingiva.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Biopsy samples of overgrown gingiva were obtained from 9 nifedipine‐treated cardiac outpatients, 13 CsA‐treated renal transplant recipients including 9 patients who were also receiving nifedipine, and 30 healthy control individuals undergoing dental treatment. Serial 5 µm thick cryostat sections were stained with mAbs for CD20 (B‐pan), CD68 (macrophages), CD4 (T‐helper/inducer), and CD8 (T‐cytotoxic/suppressor) using an avidin‐biotin‐horseradish peroxidase complex method. Numbers of mAb‐labeled and all nucleated cells were determined in 3 areas: the connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium, the middle connective tissue, and the connective tissue beneath the oral epithelium. Distributions of each type of cell were expressed as percentages of mAb‐labeled cells in relation to total number of nucleated cells in a counting zone. Significances of differences between groups were tested by means of the Kruskal‐Wallis test, and between pairs of results by means of the Mann‐Whitney U‐test.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The proportion of CD8‐labeled cells was significantly higher in connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium in the nifedipine group than in the controls (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.014).

Topical diltiazem ointment in the treatment of chronic anal fissure,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Chronic anal fissure has traditionally been treated surgically. Initial enthusiasm for chemical sphincterotomy has waned because of poor outcomes with glyceryl trinitrate ointment. In this study the use of topical 2 per cent diltiazem ointment has been investigated as an alternative method of chemical sphincterotomy.</jats:p>
               </jats:sec>
               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>A prospective assessment of 71 consecutive patients with a chronic anal fissure treated with 2 per cent topical diltiazem ointment for a median duration of 9 (range 2–16) weeks was performed.</jats:p>
               </jats:sec>
               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Fifty-one patients (75 per cent) experienced healing of the fissure after 2–3 months of treatment with topical diltiazem. Seventeen patients who did not heal were treated for a further 8 weeks with topical diltiazem. Eight of these patients subsequently healed with diltiazem. Fifty-nine of 67 patients who completed follow-up therefore healed on diltiazem ointment. Four patients experienced perianal dermatitis and one patient experienced headaches. No other side-effects were recorded. After a median of 32 (range 14–67) weeks' follow-up following completion of treatment, 27 of 41 patients available remain symptom free. Six of seven patients with recurrent fissure were treated successfully by repeat chemical sphincterotomy.</jats:p>

                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Topical 2 per cent diltiazem ointment used as an agent for chemical sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissure offers significant healing rates but does not have a significant side-effect profile, which may aid compliance to treatment. Early recurrences are common but usually amenable to further chemical sphincterotomy.</jats:p>

Prevalence and Risk of Gingival Enlargement in Patients Treated With Nifedipine,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Gingival enlargement is a known side effect of nifedipine use. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and risk factors for gingival enlargement in nifedipinetreated patients.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> A cross‐sectional study was conducted in a primary care center. Data from 65 patients taking nifedipine were compared with 147 controls who had never received the drug. All patients were examined for the presence of gingival enlargement using 2 different indices: vertical gingival overgrowth index (GO) in 6 points around each tooth, and horizontal MB index in the interdental area. Gingival index, plaque index, and probing depth were also evaluated.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The prevalence of gingival enlargement was significantly higher in nifedipine‐treated cases than in controls (GO index, 33.8% versus 4.1%; MB index, 50.8% versus 7.5%, respectively). Higher gingival and plaque indices were observed in patients taking nifedipine. Among the possible risk factors, only the gingival index showed a significant association with gingival enlargement. The risk (odds ratio [OR]) of gingival enlargement associated with nifedipine therapy was 10.6 (3.8‐29.1) for the GO index and 14.4 (6‐34.6) for the MB index. Gingival index‐adjusted ORs were 9.6 (3.3‐28.1) and 9.7 (3.9‐23.3), respectively. In the subset of high nifedipine exposure patients, the odds ratio for gingival enlargement increased to 17.4 (5.3‐56.3) for the GO index and 23.6 (7.7‐72.3) for the MB index. The concordance between GO and MB indices showed a kappa value of 0.689 in controls and 0.642 in patients treated with nifedipine.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Patients taking nifedipine are at high risk for gingival enlargement, and gingivitis acts as a predisposing factor. <jats:italic>J Periodontol 2001;72:605‐611.</jats:italic></jats:p>",0

Calcium Channel Blocker Nifedipine Slows Down Progression of Coronary Calcification in Hypertensive Patients Compared With Diuretics,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic>
            —Calcium  controls numerous events within the vessel wall. Permeability of the  endothelium is calcium dependent, as are platelet  activation and adhesion, vascular smooth muscle proliferation and  migration, and synthesis of fibrous connective tissue. Double-helix  computerized tomography is a noninvasive technique that can detect,  measure, and compare coronary calcification in the  coronary arteries. Using this method, our objective was to  determine whether administration of  nifedipine once daily in lieu of  diuretics in high-risk hypertensive patients will arrest or  slow down the progression of coronary artery calcification. The  study was designed as a side arm of INSIGHT (International  Nifedipine Study: Intervention as Goal for Hypertension  Therapy), aimed to show the efficacy of nifedipine once  daily versus co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg,  amiloride 2.5 mg) in high-risk hypertensive patients. A total of 201  patients with a total calcium score of ≥10 at the onset of study who  underwent an annual double-helix computerized tomography for 3 years  were analyzed for efficacy. Inhibition of coronary  calcium progression was significant in the nifedipine  versus the co-amilozide group during the first year (3.18% versus  27%, respectively,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.02),  not significant during the second year (28.5% versus 47%,  respectively,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.14), and  significant during the third year (40% versus 78%, respectively,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.02). The results point to a  slower progression of coronary calcification in hypertensive  patients on nifedipine once daily versus  co-amilozide.

Emergency Room Management of Hypertensive Urgencies and Emergencies,"<jats:p> <jats:italic>Hypertensive crisis affects upward of 500,000 Americans each year. Although the incidence of hypertensive crisis is low, affecting fewer than 1% of hypertensive adults, more than 50 million adult Americans suffer from hypertension. Presentation of a patient with severe hypertension to the emergency room demands immediate evaluation, prompt recognition of a hypertensive emergency or urgency, and the prompt institution of appropriate therapeutic measures to prevent progression of target‐organ damage and to avoid a catastrophic event. Hypertensive emergencies are severe elevations in blood pressure that are complicated by evidence of progressive target‐organ dysfunction such as coronary ischemia, disordered cerebral function, a cerebrovascular event, pulmonary edema, or renal failure. Although therapy with parenteral antihypertensive agents may be initiated in the emergency department, these patients warrant prompt admission to an intensive care unit where continuous monitoring of blood pressure can be assured during therapy.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",0
A Prospective Comparison of Four Antihypertensive Agents in Daily Clinical Practice,"<jats:p> <jats:italic>Clinical trials for comparison of antihypertensive agents seem to greatly differ from clinical practice. One limitation of clinical trials is the absence of a random distribution of target organ damage that can determine differences in the response to a given therapy. This study was designed to evaluate, within the conditions of daily clinical practice, the capacity of four different antihypertensive drugs to control blood pressure in essential hypertensive patients randomly distributed according to an assessment of target organ damage. A group of 200 mild essential hypertensives (44.4±12.5 years old; 50.3% male) sent to our unit for routine evaluation and therapy of their hypertension were included in the study. They were randomly allocated to four different therapeutic agents (atenolol, lisinopril, nisoldipine, or losartan). There were 50 patients in each group. After a 4‐week washout of previous antihypertensive therapy, or without it if previously untreated (43 %), patients received one of the four medications in an open fashion. A random distribution was performed for sex, age, and the presence of target organ damage, including left ventricular hypertrophy determined by echocardiography, alterations (plaque or thickening) on carotid Doppler ultrasonograms, and/or the presence of microalbuminuria (&gt;30 mg/24 h). Efficacy and tolerability were evaluated after 12 weeks of therapy. Left ventricular hypertrophy was detected in 32% of patients, diastolic dysfunction in 30.1%, and systolic dysfunction in 1.9%. Carotid plaques were detected in 41.5% of subjects, but only 10.4% had more than one plaque. Medial/intimal thickness of &gt;1.00 mm was present in 41.5% of patients. Finally, 27% exhibited microalbuminuria. The expected correlations among the different components of target organ damage were found. After 12 weeks of therapy, blood pressure reductions were similar in all groups, and the expected goal of control (diastolic pressure of &lt;90 mm Hg) was attained in 64.6% of atenolol patients, 68.8% on lisinopril, 62.2% on nisoldipine, and 60.8% on losartan. No severe adverse events were observed, and the withdrawal rates were 20% with atenolol, 10% with lisinopril and nisoldipine, and 8% with losartan. In conclusion, the four antihypertensive agents showed equal antihypertensive efficacy in patients with a similar degree of target organ damage. The β blocker exhibited the lowest tolerability. These results are in agreement with those obtained in prospective clinical trials.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",0

The first month after ECV, patients recorded heart rhythm using daily transtelephonic monitoring. No additional antiarrhythmic drugs were given. Of the 97 patients, 43 patients (20 verapamil) underwent ECV per protocol. Median previous AF duration was 18 and 26 days for verapamil and digoxin, respectively. There were no differences in atrial dimensions and underlying heart disease between the two groups. The success rate of ECV was 75% versus 83% (<jats:styled-content>P = NS</jats:styled-content>). After 1 month, 47% versus 53% (<jats:styled-content>P = NS</jats:styled-content>) had recurrence of AF.

"A Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel-Group Study to Compare the Anti-Hypertensive Effects of Imidapril and Nifedipine in the Treatment of Mild-to-Moderate Essential Hypertension","<jats:p> This 12-week, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study compared efficacy of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidapril 5–10 mg/day and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine slow-release (SR) formulation 20–40 mg twice daily. In total 320 patients aged 18–75 years, with mean sitting diastolic blood pressures of 95–115 mmHg, were randomized to treatment with imidapril ( n = 157) or nifedipine SR ( n = 163). Efficacy evaluations were based on the intent-to-treat principle. On study completion, there was no difference between the groups with respect to the primary efficacy variable of response to treatment (imidapril 63.1%; nifedipine SR 61.3%). After 2 weeks' treatment, clinically relevant decreases in blood pressure were observed in both groups, with a trend towards further reductions until study end. Fewer patients in the imidapril-treated group than the nifedipine group withdrew due to adverse events that occurred on treatment with study medication (3.2% versus 16.0%) or experienced adverse events (40.1% versus 49.7%). In addition, fewer adverse events were causally related to imidapril (24.2%) compared with nifedipine SR (41.7%). These results show that imidapril is effective in the treatment of essential hypertension and is better tolerated than nifedipine SR </jats:p>",0

Connective Tissue Growth Factor in Drug‐Induced Gingival Overgrowth,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Drug‐induced gingival overgrowth is a known side effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of systemic disorders. The pathogenesis and mechanisms responsible for this condition are not fully understood. This study assesses for the presence and localization of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in drug‐induced gingival overgrowth tissues. CTGF immunostaining was compared with sections stained with transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β1 and CD31 antibodies in order to investigate possible pathogenic mechanisms.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Gingival overgrowth samples were obtained from patients undergoing therapy with phenytoin (n = 9), nifedipine (n = 4), cyclosporin A (n = 5), and control tissues from systemically healthy donors (n = 9). Tissue sections were subjected to peroxidase immunohistochemistry and were stained with CTGF and TGF‐β1 polyclonal primary antibodies. Possible relationships between CTGF staining and angiogenesis were also studied using an anti‐CD31 antibody as a marker for endothelial cells. Staining was analyzed by computerassisted quantitative and semiquantitative methodology at 5 defined sites in all samples based on the location of specific landmarks including epithelium and underlying connective tissues.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Cellular and extracellular CTGF content in phenytoin gingival overgrowth tissues was significantly (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt;0.05) higher compared to the other gingival overgrowth tissues and the controls. Higher CTGF staining in phenytoin gingival overgrowth tissues was accompanied by an increased abundance of fibroblasts and connective tissue fibers. No strong association of CTGF staining with TGF‐β1 or CD31 staining was found.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The data from the present study show significantly higher CTGF staining in phenytoin‐induced gingival overgrowth tissues compared to controls, cyclosporin A‐, or nifedipine‐induced gingival overgrowth. Moreover, semiquantitative analyses of histologic samples support the concept that the phenytoin overgrowth tissues are fibrotic. These associations suggest a possible role for CTGF in promoting development of fibrotic lesions in phenytoin‐induced gingival overgrowth. <jats:italic>J Periodontol 2001;72:921‐931.</jats:italic></jats:p>",0
Antihypertensive drug prescription trends at the primary health care centres in Bahrain,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Purpose</jats:title><jats:p>To determine the antihypertensive drug prescribing pattern by primary care physicians in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension; to identify whether such pattern of prescription is appropriate and in accordance with international guidelines for pharmacotherapy of hypertension; and to estimate the impact of such prescriptions on cost of treatment.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>A prescription‐based survey among patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension was conducted in seven out of a total of 18 health centres in Bahrain. The relevant data for our study was collected using cards, designed for chronically‐ill patients.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>A total of 1019 male and 1395 female (62.9%) out of 3838 of the study population were on monotherapy, whereas 596 male and 828 female (37.1%) were on antihypertensive combination therapy. Among the monotherapy category, the various antihypertensive drugs used were as follows: beta‐blockers (58.8%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (14.2%), calcium channel blockers (11.1%), diuretics (8.1%) and α‐methyldopa (7.0%). With respect to overall utilization pattern, beta‐blockers were the most frequently prescribed (65.5%), diuretics ranked second (27.4%), followed by ACE inhibitors (20.6%), calcium channel blockers (19.9%) and α‐methyldopa (8.5%). Within each class of antihypertensives used, the most frequently used individual agents were as follows: (a) among beta‐blockers 97.7% used atenolol; (b) among the diuretics, indapamide (35.4%), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (32.7%), HCTZ in combination with triamterene (25.7%), and chlorthalidone (4.6%); (c) among the ACE inhibitors, captopril (44.9%), enalapril (29.7%), and lisinopril (19.0%); (d) among the calcium channel blockers, nifedipine (98.2%). Significant age‐ and gender‐related differences in prescribing patterns were seen. Short‐acting nifedipine monotherapy was inappropriately prescribed in a significant number of patients above the age of 50 years. ACE inhibitors accounted for approximately two‐thirds of the total antihypertensive drug expenditure, although these drugs represent only one‐fifth of overall antihypertensives used. There is a trend towards excessive use of expensive thiazide‐like diuretics such as indapamide which seems to be unjustifiable practice, particularly in a study population free from diabetic hypertensive patients.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>The general pattern of antihypertensive utilization appears to be in accordance with the guidelines of WHO and the Joint National Committee issued in the 1990s. The trends of prescribing of antihypertensives were in favour of conventional ones such as the beta blockers and diuretics, and the introduction of newer classes of antihypertensives had a generally minimal impact on the prescribing profile. Almost two‐thirds of the patients were treated with monotherapy. A disproportionately large percentage of antihypertensive drug cost was due to overt use of ACE inhibitors, and indapamide, instead of thiazide diuretics. The use of short‐acting calcium channel blockers especially in the elderly is unjustifiable. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

A Comparison of Selected Antihypertensives and the Use of Conventional vs Ambulatory Blood Pressure in the Detection and Treatment of Hypertension,"<jats:p>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of selected antihypertensives (doxazosin, amlodipine, enalapril, and bendrofluazide) in maintaining 24-hour control of blood pressure (BP). The predictive value of ambulatory (A)BP versus clinic (C)BP measurements as a method for detecting patients with hypertension was also evaluated. A total of 204 patients were screened and of these 110 were diagnosed as mild to moderately hypertensive with clinic diastolic BP 100–110 mm Hg (≧95 mm Hg in patients with coronary heart disease risk factors). The 4 antihypertensives were all equally effective at controlling BP over 24 h, as shown by 24-hour ABP measurements. The incidence of adverse events was similar for all 4 treatment groups; headache was the most common event, being reported by 22 patients (20%). There was a clinically relevant reduction in total cholesterol for the doxazosin (–15.4 mg/dl) and amlodipine (–11.6 mg/dl) treatment groups in comparison with enalapril and bendrofluazide. Our results from ABP measurements suggest that the antihypertensives studied are effective first-line therapy in the regulation of hypertension and that ABP is a reproducible measure. ABP may also be useful in identifying patients with various types of high BP, for instance those with ‘white coat’ hypertension, enabling more accurate screening and diagnosis.</jats:p>",0

Treating Hypertension in the Elderly,"<jats:p> <jats:bold>
            <jats:italic>Hypertension is highly prevalent in elderly individuals, the most rapidly growing segment of the US population. Epidemiologic studies have established that increased risk of cardiovascular disease is associated with elevated blood pressure. Treatment of hypertension in elderly patients significantly reduces their cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, antihypertensive therapy is often challenging in this patient population because of potential metabolic and physiologic alterations, multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, and biologic variability. Drugs with a convenient dosing schedule, minimal side effects, and the ability to impact comorbid conditions are important considerations in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly.</jats:italic>

Comparative Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Amlodipine in Hypertensive Patients with and without Type II Diabetes Mellitus,"<jats:p>Recent clinical trials aimed at attenuating complications in diabetes mellitus have generated interest in the impact of drug formulation and altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in diabetes. Specifically, it has been proposed that the diabetic state may alter the pharmacokinetics of several cardiovascular drugs, including some calcium antagonists. The present study investigates the effects of diabetes mellitus on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amlodipine in hypertensive subjects with and without diabetes mellitus to determine whether the diabetic state alters these parameters. This trial consisted of a 2‐week placebo washout phase, a 2‐week titration phase, and a 2‐week maintenance phase. Study patients included 18 hypertensive patients with type II diabetes mellitus and 10 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. Blood samples were collected after administration of amlodipine and AUC, C<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>, and t<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> were determined. The acute 24‐hour pharmacodynamic response to amlodipine was assessed by blood pressure and telemetric heart rate measurements. There were no significant differences for either amlodipine 5 or 10 mg in AUC (p = 0.40 for 5 mg; p = 0.59 for 10 mg), C<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> (p = 0.41 for 5 mg; p = 0.45 for 10 mg), and t<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> (p = 0.79 for 5 mg; p = 0.67 for 10 mg) between diabetic and nondiabetic hypertensive subjects. Similarly, the 24‐hour pharmacodynamic effects of amlodipine on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate did not differ between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects as assessed by repeated‐measures analysis of variance. Because of the theoretical basis for anticipating that diabetes mellitus may provoke important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations, our study provides an important database in clearly demonstrating that the diabetic milieu did not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of amlodipine.</jats:p>",0

One-Year Study of Felodipine or Placebo for Stage 1 Isolated Systolic Hypertension,"<jats:p>
            A substantial number of older hypertensive patients have stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure between 140 and 159 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg), but there are currently no data showing that drug treatment is effective, safe, and/or beneficial. To compare the effects of active treatment compared with placebo on blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and quality of life among older stage 1 isolated systolic hypertensive patients, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial comparing felodipine (2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily) and matching placebo was performed in 171 patients (49% male, average age 66±7 years, with 49% white and 30% Hispanic) with a baseline blood pressure of 149±7/83±6 mm Hg. During 52 weeks of treatment, patients randomized to active treatment achieved significantly lower blood pressures (137.0±11.7/80.2±7.6 mm Hg for extended-release felodipine versus 147.5±16.0/83.5±9.7 mm Hg for placebo,

Stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension can be effectively and safely treated pharmacologically. Treatment reduced progression to the higher stages of hypertension, reduced the incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved an overall measure of the quality of life. Larger and longer studies will be needed to document any long-term reduction in cardiovascular event rates associated with treating stage 1 systolic hypertension.

No adverse effects were experienced in 15 of the 25 patients. Lower extremity edema was the most commonly reported adverse effect (four patients). Two patients discontinued treatment because of pulmonary edema in one and chest pain in the other. Two patients were lost to follow‐up. After a mean of 10.6 weeks, repeat 24‐hour ambulatory monitoring was performed to evaluate blood pressure control with nisoldipine. Systolic and diastolic ambulatory results for daytime, nighttime, and total 24 hours were calculated. For amlodipine versus nisoldipine, no significant differences existed in any of the blood pressure parameters (p&gt;0.05) in the 21 patients who completed the study, except for 24‐hour diastolic pressure (p&lt;0.05); however, this latter difference was only 2 mm Hg (nisoldipine 77 mm Hg, amlodipine 75 mm Hg).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>.

Efficacy of nifedipine or lisinopril in the treatment of hypertension after renal transplantation: a double‐blind randomised comparative trial,"<jats:p>Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme‐inhibitors are commonly used in the treatment of hypertensive renal transplant recipients. The purpose of this study was to investigate if the response rate to treatment differs with these drugs in this setting.  A single centre, prospective, randomised, double‐blinded, comparative study to address the efficacy of controlled release nifedipine or lisinopril in the treatment of hypertension (diastolic blood pressure ≥95 mmHg) in cyclosporin (CsA)‐treated renal transplant recipients was performed. Recipients were randomised to receive either lisinopril (10 mg once daily) or controlled release nifedipine (30 mg once daily). The dose was doubled on indication. The number of responders (diastolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg on monotherapy) were addressed during the early post‐transplant phase (first 3 months) and during a late post‐transplant phase (from 3 to 12 months after renal transplantation) in the same patient population.  One hundred and fifty‐four patients (nifedipine=78, lisinopril=76) with untreated hypertension (diastolic blood pressure≥95 mmHg) were randomised within 3 wk after renal transplantation. One hundred and twenty‐tree patients (nifedipine=69, lisinopril=54) completed the study. Fourteen (20%) nifedipine‐treated recipients responded during the early, and 26 (38%) during the late post‐operative phase (months 4–12 after renal transplantation). Eleven (20%) lisinopril‐treated recipients responded during the early, and 18 (33%) during the late post‐transplant phase. Non‐responders were, on average, 8.5±1.5 kg heavier both in the early phase and after 1 yr of treatment (p&lt;0.01), and 6.1±0.9 yr older than responders (p&lt;0.05).  In conclusion, these results indicate that both controlled release nifedipine and lisinopril are equally efficient in the treatment of post‐transplant hypertension. As monotherapy, both drugs show a ‘response rate’ of 20–38%, depending on time interval<jats:italic>after</jats:italic>transplantation.</jats:p>",0
"A Double-Blind, Parallel-Group Study of Amlodipine versus Long-Acting Nitrate in the Management of Elderly Patients with Stable Angina","<jats:p>Ninety-seven elderly patients with stable angina were included in a 28-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of amlodipine 5–10 mg and isosorbide mononitrate 25–50 mg once daily. The total exercise time, as limited by angina, was recorded together with the median incidence per week of angina attacks and glyceryl trinitrate consumption. Safety was assessed by adverse event frequency, measurement of vital signs and laboratory parameters, and quality of life. At the final visit, the total exercise time was significantly greater relative to baseline with amlodipine than isosorbide mononitrate (final/baseline difference: 112.2 vs. 32.2, p = 0.016). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in relation to the incidence of adverse events. Once daily amlodipine provides significantly better control of stable angina than isosorbide mononitrate in this elderly population.</jats:p>",1

A Review of Class III Antiarrhythmic Agents for Atrial Fibrillation: Maintenance of Normal Sinus Rhythm,"<jats:p>A noteworthy shift from class I to class III antiarrhythmic agents for suppression of atrial fibrillation has occurred. Sotalol, amiodarone, and dofetilide have been evaluated for their ability to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. All of these agents are moderately effective; however, amiodarone appears to be most efficacious. Aside from their common class III actions, these agents have profoundly different pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, safety, and drug interaction profiles that help guide drug selection. Amiodarone and dofetilide are safe in patients who have had a myocardial infarction and those with heart failure. The safety of commercially available d,l‐sotalol in these patients is poorly understood. Torsades de pointes is the most serious adverse effect of sotalol and dofetilide, and risk increases with renal dysfunction. Amiodarone has minimal proarrhythmic risk but has numerous noncardiac toxicities that require frequent monitoring. Overall, an ideal antiarrhythmic agent does not exist, and drug selection should be highly individualized.</jats:p>",0

Changes in Renal Resistive Index and Urinary Albumin Excretion in Hypertensive Patients under Long-Term Treatment with Lisinopril or Nifedipine GITS,"<jats:p>&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt; Increased renal vascular resistance and microalbuminuria are associated with hypertensive target organ damage and may be predictors of hypertensive nephrosclerosis. &lt;i&gt;Aim:&lt;/i&gt; We investigated changes in renal resistive index (RI) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in a group of patients with primary hypertension before and during long-term antihypertensive treatment. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; Thirty-two patients were randomized to receive antihypertensive treatment with either a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine GITS, up to 90 mg/day, n = 16) or an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril, up to 20 mg/day, n = 16), alone or in association with a diuretic (chlortalidone, 25 mg/day). Blood pressure, renal resistive index (by US Doppler) and UAE (mean of three nonconsecutive timed urinary collections, µg/min) were evaluated at baseline and over the course of 24 months of treatment. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Both regimens effectively lowered blood pressure (mean blood pressure from 123 ± 1.8 at baseline to 103 ± 1.5 mm Hg at 24 months in the lisinopril group and from 122 ± 1.9 at baseline to 104 ± 0.8 at 24 months in the nifedipine group, p &lt; 0.001 for both groups). Overall, blood pressure decrease was associated with a reduction in UAE and no change in RI throughout the study. However, despite similar blood pressure reduction, the two regimens showed different specific effects. Lisinopril was associated with a significant decrease in both UAE (33.8 ± 16.2 at baseline and 9.1 ± 2.1 at 24 months, p &lt; 0.01) and renal RI (0.61 ± 0.02 at baseline and 0.56 ± 0.04 at 24 months, p &lt; 0.05) while nifedipine GITS did not significantly influence UAE (35.7 ± 12.2 at baseline and 31.2 ± 12.1 at 24 months, n.s.) or RI (0.61 ± 0.01 at baseline and 0.59 ± 0.02 at 24 months, n.s.). &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; Effective blood pressure control over a long period of time reduces the severity of organ damage, namely UAE while maintaining renovascular resistance in patients with essential hypertension. Different classes of antihypertensive agents might convey additional specific renal protection beyond blood pressure control. These data could be useful in devising individualized therapeutic strategies in hypertensive patients at increased renal risk.</jats:p>",0

"Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Antagonist, Losartan, Causes Regression of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in End-Stage Renal Disease","<jats:p>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) commonly occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) antagonists may be able to reverse LVH independent to the hypotensive effect in the ESRD setting. Thirty chronically hemodialyzed uremic patients with hypertension were randomly assigned to receive the AT1-R antagonist losartan (n = 10), the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACD) inhibitor enalapril (n = 10), or calcium antagonist amlodipine (n = 10). Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was measured by echocardiography before and 6 months after treatment. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ between the three groups. The mean baseline LVM index also did not differ in the three groups. After 6 months of treatment, losartan treatment significantly reduced the LVM index (–24.7 ± 3.2%) than amlodipine (–10.5 ± 5.2%) or enalapril (–11.2 ± 4.1%) therapy. All three groups had a similar decrease in the mean blood pressure with treatment. The plasma angiotensin II concentration increased 5-fold with losartan treatment. In contrast, the plasma angiotension II concentration did not change with enalapril and only increased 2-fold with amlodipine. Thus, the present study indicates that losartan more effectively regresses LVH in patients with ESRD than do enalapril and amlodipine despite a comparable depressor effect between the three drugs.</jats:p>",0

Factors Related to the Occurrence of Microalbuminuria During Antihypertensive Treatment in Essential Hypertension,"<jats:p>
            The objective of the study was to assess the factors related to the occurrence of microalbuminuria during the follow-up of a young adult group with essential hypertension that had not been previously treated. Normo-albuminuric essential hypertensives, &lt;50 years old, who had not been previously treated with antihypertensive drugs and who did not have diabetes mellitus were included. After the initial evaluation, patients were treated using only nonpharmacological measures (n=62), β-blockers (n=38), ACE inhibitors (n=64), calcium channel blockers (n=8), and several classes (n=15). Measurements were taken for office blood pressure, biochemical profile, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion at the beginning of the study and were measured yearly during an average of 2.7±1.2 years of follow-up. Among the 187 patients included, 22 (11,7%) developed microalbuminuria (progressors, 4.4/100 patients/y). No differences were present between progressors and those who remained normo-albuminuric (nonprogressors) in terms of age, gender, body mass index, disease duration, blood pressure values, biochemical profile, familial history of diabetes or hypertension, smoking habits, or the presence of EKG left ventricular hypertrophy. The group with the lowest progression rate was the patients treated with ACE inhibitors (n=5; 2.9/100 patients/y), followed by the diet group (n=5; 3.3/100 patients/y) and the β-blockers group (n=5; 4.1/100 patients/y). When we excluded patients treated with calcium channel blockers or those who changed over time between different classes of treatment, no significant differences in the incidence of microalbuminuria were observed among the groups. Progressors showed higher slopes of fasting glucose (4.78±11.4 versus 0.50±6.8 mg/y,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.02) and uric acid (0.58±0.93 versus 0.05±1.10 mg/y,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.03) compared with the slopes of nonprogressors. Both the slopes for glucose and systolic blood pressure over time were associated independently with the slope of the logarithm of urinary albumin excretion when adjusted for age, gender, and treatment groups. Cox proportional hazard model for progression of microalbuminuria showed that baseline urinary albumin excretion (risk ratio [RR]=1.06; confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.01 to 1.11), slope for systolic blood pressure (RR=1.11; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.20), and slope for glucose (RR=1.08; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.14) were independently associated to the development of microalbuminuria. In conclusion, in a group of young adults with essential hypertension that had not been previously treated, the main factors influencing the occurrence of microalbuminuria during antihypertensive treatment were the values of microalbuminuria at baseline and the slopes for systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose.

Effect of calcium channel antagonist diltiazem and calcium ionophore A23187 on cyclosporine A‐induced apoptosis of renal tubular cells,"<jats:p>Calcium channel antagonists have been reported to have a favorable impact on cyclosporin A (CsA)‐treated kidney transplant recipients. However, it is not clear whether this is because of their direct effect on antagonizing the toxicity of CsA to renal tubular cells. In this study, we have used Madin–Darby canine kidney tubular cells as a model to examine the effect of diltiazem, a calcium channel antagonist, on CsA‐induced apoptosis. Moreover, to investigate the possible regulation of CsA cytotoxicity by intracellular calcium level, the effect of the calcium ionophore A23187 on CsA‐induced apoptosis was also examined. We found that treatment of CsA (20 μM) alone caused 20–30% cell death, which was apparently (30–40%) enhanced by diltiazem at 100 μg/ml, accompanied by more severe DNA fragmentation, activation of caspases, and a decreased level of Bcl‐2. The caspase inhibitor ZVAD‐fmk or Bcl‐2 overexpression was capable of suppressing apoptosis induced by the synergistic effect of diltiazem and CsA. Moreover, the survival rate of cells treated with CsA (30 μM) alone remained only 30%, however, it was markedly (∼40%) elevated by co‐treatment with A23187 (75 ng/ml). The rescue of cells from CsA‐induced apoptosis by A23187 was correlated with AKT activation, BAD phosphorylation, and caspase‐3 inactivation. Taken together, our results suggest that the reported favorable impact of diltiazem on kidney grafts is likely not because of its direct protection on renal tubular cells. Instead, it enhances the toxicity of CsA to renal tubular cells. In addition, our findings raise a possibility that the intracellular calcium level and the AKT pathway may participate in the regulation of CsA cytotoxicity.</jats:p>",0

Effects of Chronic Calcium Channel Blockade on Sympathetic Nerve Activity in Hypertension,"<jats:p>
            The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is an important regulator of the circulation. Its activity is increased in hypertension and heart failure and adversely affects prognosis. Although certain drugs inhibit SNS, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists may stimulate the system. Phenylalkylamine calcium antagonists such as verapamil have a different pharmacological profile. We therefore tested the hypothesis of whether amlodipine, nifedipine, or verapamil differs in the effects on muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSA). Forty-three patients (31 men, 12 women) with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to 1 drug for 8 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, and MSA (by microneurography) were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. All calcium antagonists led to a similar decrease in blood pressure of 5.0±1.5 to 6.4±1.4 mm Hg at 8 weeks (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.001 versus baseline). There were no significant differences in MSA between groups. With amlodipine, MSA averaged 49±3 bursts/min (3 versus baseline); with nifedipine, 48±3 bursts/min (2 versus baseline); and with verapamil, 49±2 bursts/min (all,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =NS). With verapamil, norepinephrine decreased by 4% but tended to increase by about one third with amlodipine or nifedipine (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =NS). Thus, in hypertension slow release forms of verapamil, nifedipine, and amlodipine exert comparable antihypertensive effects and do not change MSA, although there was a trend toward decreased MSA and plasma norepinephrine with verapamil.

Compared to patients without ADEs, patients in the ADE group were older (72 ± 12.6 years (mean ± SD) vs. 65 ± 13 years, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.048), their average stay in hospital was longer (7.3 ± 5.5 days vs. 5.2 ± 3.7 days, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.018) and their mean urea levels were higher (10.8 ± 9.3 mmol/l vs. 7.8 ± 5.3 mmol/l, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.027). The most frequent background pathologies of the 20 patients with ADEs were hypertension (in 18 (90%)) and atrial fibrillation (in nine (45%)). In 50% of the the ADE group there was a history of drug allergies. The ADEs recorded were bleeding in four (20%), arrhythmias in six (30%), orthostatic hypotension in six (30%) and skin necrosis, paranoid reaction, acute hepatitis and acute renal failure in four (20%). The causative drugs were warfarin (which accounted for 25% of the ADEs), beta‐blockers (15%), propafenone (5%), amiodarone (5%), and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>‐channel blockers, nitrates and diuretics (together accounting for 50% of ADEs).

"Von Willebrand Factor, Soluble P-Selectin, and Target Organ Damage in Hypertension","<jats:p>
            To investigate the relationship between soluble markers of platelet, endothelial and rheological function, and target organ damage and their response to intensified management in a population of middle-age hypertensive patients at high risk of cardiovascular complications, we studied 382 consecutive patients (308 men; mean age, 63 years, SD 8) along with 60 normotensive controls free of cardiovascular disease. Patients were divided into those with target organ damage (TOD; n=107) and those free of end-organ damage. Plasma levels of soluble P-selectin (sP-sel), a marker of platelet activation, and von Willebrand factor (vWF), an index of endothelial damage/dysfunction (both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the rheological indices fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, hematocrit, platelet, and white cell count were measured. In 53 patients, variables were further measured after 6 months of intensified cardiovascular risk management. Patients with TOD had significantly higher vWF, 137 (SD 33) versus 125 (SD 33) IU/dL (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>

            =0.002). There were no statistically significant differences in plasma viscosity, fibrinogen, hematocrit, white blood cell count, platelet count, or sP-sel between the 2 subgroups. In multivariate analysis, vWF was a significant independent predictor for TOD. After 6 months of intensified management in 53 patients who entered the trial, there were significant reductions in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, hematocrit, plasma viscosity, sP-sel, and vWF (all

Should β Blockers Be Used in the Treatment of Hypertension in the Elderly?,"<jats:p> <jats:italic>The lack of benefit and the potential negative side effects of β blockers are overstated, especially in the elderly. This emphasis has led to recommendations by some investigators that these agents not be used in the management of hypertension in this age group. There are numerous reasons why these recommendations should not be followed. The use of β blockers in the elderly hypertensive has resulted in a reduction in strokes and congestive heart failure. In addition, it should be emphasized that elderly patients are more likely to have silent coronary artery disease or sustain myocardial infarctions. There is abundant evidence that β blockers are effective therapy in reducing mortality once a myocardial infarction has occurred. In fact, there is a clear reduction in sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, national statistics document that elderly patients have a prevalence of congestive heart failure that varies from 6%–10%. Multiple studies have now documented that β blockers are additive to angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing mortality for congestive heart failure. Thus, elderly hypertensive patients may benefit from the use of β blockers, especially if there is evidence of ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",0

            Elevated urine albumin excretion (UAER) is a modifiable risk factor for renal and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system lowers UAER, but whether this effect is independent of blood pressure (BP) reduction remains controversial. The MicroAlbuminuria Reduction With VALsartan (MARVAL) study was designed to evaluate the BP-independent effect of valsartan on UAER in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria.

            Three hundred thirty-two patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, with or without hypertension, were randomly assigned to 80 mg/d valsartan or 5 mg/d amlodipine for 24 weeks. A target BP of 135/85 mm Hg was aimed for by dose-doubling followed by addition of bendrofluazide and doxazosin whenever needed. The primary end point was the percent change in UAER from baseline to 24 weeks. The UAER at 24 weeks was 56% (95% CI, 49.6 to 63.0) of baseline with valsartan and 92% (95% CI, 81.7 to 103.7) of baseline with amlodipine, a highly significant between-group effect (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.001). Valsartan lowered UAER similarly in both the hypertensive and normotensive subgroups. More patients reversed to normoalbuminuria with valsartan (29.9% versus 14.5%;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.001). Over the study period, BP reductions were similar between the two treatments (systolic/diastolic 11.2/6.6 mm Hg for valsartan, 11.6/6.5 mm Hg for amlodipine) and at no time point was there a between-group significant difference in BP values in either the hypertensive or the normotensive subgroup.

            For the same level of attained BP and the same degree of BP reduction, valsartan lowered UAER more effectively than amlodipine in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, including the subgroup with baseline normotension. This indicates a BP-independent antiproteinuric effect of valsartan.

Efficacy and Safety of Barnidipine Compared with Felodipine in the Treatment of Hypertension in Chinese Patients,"<jats:p> The efficacy and safety profiles of barnidipine in the treatment of hypertension were evaluated in an open parallel-group study. Fifty-nine Chinese patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were randomized to receive either barnidipine or felodipine (5 mg once daily, titrated to 10 mg or 15 mg once daily, as indicated) for 12 weeks. Both drugs reduced blood pressures significantly with ≥ 68% of cases obtaining marked or moderate blood pressure reduction. Mean reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure for barnidipine treatment were 23.7 ± 13.5 mmHg and 12.7 ± 7.9 mmHg, and for felodipine, 24.3 ± 18.4 mmHg and 14.5 ± 10.0 mmHg, respectively. There was no significant difference between these two drugs in anti-hypertensive effect, heart rate, laboratory measurements or incidence of adverse events. The only difference was that more patients taking felodipine experienced palpitations. We conclude that barnidipine has similar efficacy and a similar safety profile to felodipine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in Chinese patients. </jats:p>",0
Nicardipine Hydrochloride Injectable Phase IV Open-Label Clinical Trial: Study on the Anti-Hypertensive Effect and Safety of Nicardipine for Acute Aortic Dissection,"<jats:p> We performed a multicentre, phase IV, open-label clinical trial to examine the clinical usefulness of a continuous infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride to control hypertension in 31 patients with acute aortic dissection. Target blood pressure levels were reached within 15 min in 16 patients; in 15–30 min in 10 patients; in 30–45 min in three patients; and in 45–60 min in two patients. Baseline average systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures were 147 ± 23 mmHg, 82 ± 18 mmHg and 104 ± 18 mmHg, respectively, with third-day pressures significantly reduced at 119 ± 12 mmHg, 69 ± 9 mmHg and 86 ± 8 mmHg. Blood pressures after discontinuation of the infusion were not significantly different from those measured on the third day of infusion and no definite adverse effects attributable to the treatment were observed. Nicardipine hydrochloride was both effective and safe at controlling blood pressure in patients with acute aortic dissection. </jats:p>",0

Migraine: Preventive Treatment,"<jats:p> Migraine is a common episodic headache disorder. A comprehensive headache treatment plan includes acute attack treatment to relieve pain and impairment and long-term preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration. Circumstances that might warrant preventive treatment include: (i) migraine that significantly interferes with the patient's daily routine despite acute treatment; (ii) failure, contraindication to, or troublesome side-effects from acute medications; (iii) overuse of acute medications; (iv) special circumstances, such as hemiplegic migraine; (v) very frequent headaches (more than two a week); or (vi) patient preference. Start the drug at a low dose. Give each treatment an adequate trial. Avoid interfering, overused, and contraindicated drugs. Re-evaluate therapy. Be sure that a woman of childbearing potential is aware of any potential risks. Involve patients in their care to maximize compliance. Consider co-morbidity. Choose a drug based on its proven efficacy, the patient's preferences and headache profile, the drug's side-effects, and the presence or absence of coexisting or co-morbid disease. Drugs that have documented high efficacy and mild to moderate adverse events (AEs) include b-blockers, amitripty-line, and divalproex. Drugs that have lower documented efficacy and mild to moderate AEs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin, topiramate, riboflavin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. </jats:p>",0

Modern medical blockade has significantly improved patient survival and morbidity. The last decade has seen the identification of the genes responsible for several hereditary causes of pheochromocytoma. Evaluation of these patients has demonstrated different catecholamine profiles associated with the different syndromes. Genetic testing and new, more sensitive catecholamine tests are allowing better, earlier diagnosis of affected patients. Some patients with small tumors deemed nonfunctional by traditional methods may be safely observed until function is demonstrated. Laparoscopic surgery has supplanted the use of open surgery in the management of these tumors. Adrenocortical‐sparing surgery may be performed using laparoscopy in patients with hereditary forms of pheochromocytoma.</jats:p>",0

Drug Effects on Aldosterone/Plasma Renin Activity Ratio in Primary Aldosteronism,"<jats:p>
            Primary aldosteronism is a specifically treatable and potentially curable form of secondary hypertension. The aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) is routinely used as a screening test. Antihypertensive therapy can interfere with the interpretation of this parameter, but a correct washout period can be potentially harmful. We have investigated the effects of therapy with atenolol, amlodipine, doxazosin, fosinopril, and irbesartan on the ARR in a group of 230 patients with suspected primary aldosteronism. The percent change from control of ARR in patients taking amlodipine was −17%±32; atenolol, 62%±82; doxazosin, −5%±26; fosinopril, −30%±24; and irbesartan, −43%±27. The ARR change induced by atenolol was significantly higher compared with that induced by all other drugs (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.0001), and the ARR change induced by irbesartan was significantly lower than that induced by doxazosin (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.0001). One of 55 patients from the group taking amlodipine (1.8%) and 4/17 of the patients taking irbesartan (23.5%) gave a false-negative ARR (&lt;50). None of the patients of the groups taking fosinopril, doxazosin, and atenolol displayed a false-negative ARR. Doxazosin and fosinopril can be used in hypertensive patients who need to undergo aldosterone and PRA measurement for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism; amlodipine gave a very small percentage of false-negative diagnoses. β-Blockers also do not interfere with the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, but they can be responsible for an increased rate of false-positive ARRs. The high rate of false-negative diagnoses in patients undergoing irbesartan treatment requires confirmation in a higher number of patients.

The aim of the study reported here was to evaluate the presence of macrophage subpopulations in normal human gingiva and in gingival overgrowth induced by nifedipine and immunosuppressive medication.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Gingival samples were taken from 11 nifedipine‐medicated cardiac outpatients (nifedipine group), 11 triple‐medicated organ‐transplant recipients also taking nifedipine (immunosuppression plus nifedipine group), 12 triple‐medicated organ‐transplant recipients (immunosuppression group), and 20 generally healthy individuals (control group). Cryostat sections were stained with mAbs for inflammatory 27E10, reparative RM3/1, and resident 25F9 macrophages using an avidinbiotin enzyme complex method. Total numbers of mAb‐labeled cells were determined in connective tissue beneath sulcular epithelium, connective tissue beneath oral epithelium, and middle connective tissue. Expression of 27E10 was determined in keratinocytes in the oral epithelium. Statistics analyses were undertaken using the chi‐square test, the Mann‐Whitney U test, the independent samples <jats:italic>t</jats:italic> test, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Greater numbers of inflammatory 27E10‐positive macrophages were found in all 3 medicated groups and counting zones than in the control group except in connective tissue beneath sulcular epithelium in the immunosuppression group. The incidence of specimens expressing 27E10 antigen throughout the oral epithelium was significantly higher in the immunosuppression group (8 of 12) than in the control group (4 of 20) and the nifedipine group (2 of 11). Numbers of reparative RM3/1‐positive macrophages were significantly greater in the immunosuppression group in connective tissue beneath oral epithelium than in the control group. The effect was markedly associated with degree of inflammation. Numbers of resident 25F9‐positive macrophages were lower in connective tissue beneath sulcular epithelium in the immunosuppression group, and higher in middle connective tissue in the nifedipine group than in the control group.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Our results show that the nature of drug‐induced gingival overgrowth differs somewhat between immunosuppressive and nifedipine medications. <jats:italic>J Periodontol 2002;73:1323‐1330.</jats:italic></jats:p>",0

Strategy for the Treatment of Noncompliant Hypertensive Hemodialysis Patients,"<jats:p> Hypertensive hemodialysis patients noncompliant for their medications do not benefit from pharmacologic advances in the treatment of high blood pressure, and increase their already high risk of cardiovascular complications. The medical staff often becomes frustrated by severe hypertension in those who refuse to take medicines at home, drink excessive fluids, miss multiple dialysis sessions and sign-off dialysis early. In addition to addressing the psychosocial, financial, educational and substance abuse problems which contribute to noncompliance, we have developed a medication strategy to serve as an at least interim means of lowering blood pressure. Antihypertensive agents which have long half-lives in renal failure (lisinopril) and/or are intrinsically long acting (transdermal clonidine and amlodipine) were administered on dialysis days by the unit personnel to those patients who did not or would not take that or any dose on their own. The lisinopril and amlodipine were assured to have been taken on at least the dialysis days (thrice weekly), and the clonidine patch replaced weekly. Sixteen patients were thus treated when they failed to reliably self-administer medications. They had a significant decline in the pre-dialysis systolic pressure of 15 mm Hg (175 ± 6 to 160 ± 5 mm Hg), diastolic of 12 mm Hg (103 ± 3 to 91 ± 3 mm Hg), and mean pressure of 13 mm Hg (127 ± 4 to 114 ± 4 mm Hg). There was an improvement in post-dialysis blood pressures, with the mean pressure declining 13 mm Hg from 110 ± 4 to 97 ± 4 mm Hg. Many individuals had erratic blood pressure control, having intermittently missed dialysis and hence unit-administered medicine, as well as continued fluid or drug abuse. The patients had uniformly excellent acceptance of this regimen, even spontaneously requesting it, and had no appreciable adverse effects. In summary while noncompliance is being addressed by the entire medical team, dialysis unit administration of long-acting medicines helps many hypertensive dialysis patients who would otherwise be at increased risk for severe cardiovascular complications. </jats:p>",0

The patients’ mean age ± SD was 66.5 ± 18.1 years and mean length of stay was 13.2 ± 9 days. Renal and hepatic insufficiency and previous history of drug intolerance were observed in 17.9%, 10.2%, and 2% of the hospitalized patients, respectively. Thirty-eight ADEs occurred in 32 patients; in 15 cases, ADEs were identified as the reason for admission, 10 cases occurred during hospitalization, and 13 cases were present at admission, but were not the cause of admission. The most frequent ADEs involved the neurologic (23.6%), renal (15.7%), and hematologic (13.1%) systems. Among these 38 ADEs, 22 were considered avoidable (57.9%); 20 of these were associated with therapeutic errors (inappropriate administration, drug–drug interactions, dosage error, drug not stopped despite the onset of ADEs). Patients with ADEs stayed longer in the hospital and took more drugs both before and during their hospital stay (p &lt; 0.05). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSIONS</jats:title><jats:p> Most of the ADEs observed in this study were avoidable. The risk/benefit ratio of administered drugs could be improved with better knowledge of the patients’ medical history and the risk factors of ADEs. </jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Antipsychotics and QT prolongation,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Objective: </jats:bold> To evaluate literature relating to cardiac QT prolongation and the use of antipsychotic drugs.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Method: </jats:bold> Literature searches of EMBASE, Medline, PsychLIT were performed in December 2001 and reference sections of retrieved papers scrutinized for further relevant reports.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold> The Cardiac QTc interval is difficult to measure precisely or accurately but appears to be a useful predictor of risk of dysrhythmia (specifically torsade de pointes) and sudden death. It is less clear that drug‐induced QTc prolongation gives rise to similar risks but data are emerging, linking antipsychotic use to increased cardiac mortality. Many antipsychotics have been clearly associated with QTc prolongation. Methodological considerations arguably preclude assuming that any antipsychotic is free of the risk of QTc prolongation and dysrhythmia.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold> Available data do not allow assessment of relative or absolute risk of dysrhythmia or sudden death engendered by antipsychotics but caution is advised. Risk of dysrhythmia can very probably be reduced by careful prescribing of antipsychotics in low doses in simple drug regimens which avoid metabolic interactions. Electrocardiographic monitoring may also help to reduce risk but review by specialist cardiologist may be necessary.</jats:p>",0

            Endothelial dysfunction is an important feature of atherosclerosis. Inhibition of the HMG-CoA pathway and of calcium channels improves endothelial function experimentally and in the forearm circulation. Thus, we investigated the effects of a statin and/or a calcium antagonist on coronary endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Endothelium-independent responses were assessed by intracoronary adenosine (1.2 mg/mL) and nitroglycerin (250 μg). Thereafter, patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to placebo, cerivastatin 0.4 mg/d, nifedipine 30 to 60 mg/d, or their combination. Studies were repeated at 6 months.

Effects of Isosorbide Mononitrate and AII Inhibition on Pulse Wave Reflection in Hypertension,"<jats:p>
            The aortic pulse wave contour in isolated systolic hypertension often shows a prominent reflection peak, which combines with the incident wave arising from cardiac ejection so as to widen pulse pressure. We investigated the effects of an extended-release nitrate preparation and of 2 angiotensin II (AII) inhibitors (an AII receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor) on the aortic pulse wave contour and systemic blood pressure in hypertensive subjects with high augmentation index caused by exaggerated pulse wave reflection. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover studies were carried out in a total of 16 elderly patients with systolic hypertension resistant to conventional antihypertensive therapy. In 1 study, pharmacodynamic responses to single doses of placebo, isosorbide mononitrate, eprosartan, and captopril were determined; in the other, single-dose isosorbide mononitrate and placebo were compared in subjects treated with AII inhibitors at baseline. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometry and pulse wave components by applanation tonometry at the radial artery. All 3 agents were shown to decrease brachial systolic blood pressure, aortic systolic blood pressure, and aortic pulse pressure. Qualitative effects on the aortic pulse wave contour differed: augmentation index was not significantly altered by either captopril or eprosartan but was decreased (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.0001) by ≈50% of the placebo value with isosorbide mononitrate in both study groups. We propose that isosorbide mononitrate corrected the magnified wave reflection in systolic hypertension of these elderly patients by an effect that was distinct from that exercised by either acute or chronic AII inhibition.

              <jats:italic>Methods and Results—</jats:italic>
            </jats:bold>
            The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes study followed 950 subjects with type 2 diabetes for 5 years; 480 of the subjects were normotensive (baseline diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg). Patients randomized to placebo (moderate blood pressure control) had a mean blood pressure of 137±0.7/81±0.3 mm Hg over the last 4 years of treatment. In contrast, patients randomized to intensive treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine had a mean 4-year blood pressure of 128±0.8/75±0.3 mm Hg (

An update on the controversies of tocolytic therapy for the prevention of preterm birth,"<jats:p> <jats:italic>Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand</jats:italic> 2003; 82: 1–9. © Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand 2003</jats:p><jats:p>Preterm birth is the major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity in the developed world. Where there are no contraindications to their use, tocolytics can improve neonatal survival rates by approximately 3% per day between 23 and 27 weeks gestation with a concomitant reduction in morbidity. The ultimate aim of tocolytic therapy is to prolong pregnancy until growth and maturation is complete, but even short‐term delay may enable the administration of antepartum glucocorticoids to reduce hyaline membrane disease or to arrange transfer to a center with neonatal intensive care facilities. Both of these have been shown to reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity. Until recently, none of the currently used tocolytics, whether licensed or unlicensed, were developed specifically for the inhibition of preterm labor and consequently, they exhibit various potentially serious side‐effects. As a result of the recent licensing of the oxytocin antagonist, atosiban, developed for the treatment of preterm labor and due to its high utero‐specificity, obstetricians have experienced an advance in their options for the management of spontaneous preterm labor.</jats:p>",0

Outcomes With Nifedipine GITS or Co-Amilozide in Hypertensive Diabetics and Nondiabetics in Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension (INSIGHT),"<jats:p>
            To investigate the impact of treatment on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, we assessed outcomes in patients with hypertension and diabetes who received co-amilozide or nifedipine in the International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension. Participants had to be 55 to 80 years of age, with hypertension (≥150/95 or ≥160 mm Hg) and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients received 30 mg nifedipine once daily or co-amilozide (25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 2.5 mg amiloride) daily. Doses were doubled if target blood pressures (&lt;140/90 mm Hg) were not achieved. Primary (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke) and secondary outcomes (composite of primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality and death from vascular and nonvascular causes) were assessed by means of intent-to-treat analyses. There was no significant difference in the incidence of primary outcomes between nifedipine-treated and co-amilozide–treated patients with diabetes at baseline (n=1302) (8.3% versus 8.4%; relative risk, 0.99, 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.42;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =1.00). A significant benefit for nifedipine-treated patients was seen for the composite secondary outcome (14.2% versus 18.7%; relative risk, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.03). Among patients without diabetes at baseline (n=5019), there was a significant difference in the incidence of new diabetes (nifedipine 4.3% versus co-amilozide 5.6%,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.023). Nifedipine GITS once daily is as effective as diuretic therapy in reducing cardiovascular complications in hypertensive diabetics. Nifedipine-treated patients were also less likely to have diabetes or have secondary events (a composite of all-cause mortality, death from a vascular cause, and death from a nonvascular cause) than co-amilozide recipients. Our results suggest that nifedipine could be considered as first-line therapy for hypertensive diabetics.

Short-Versus Long-Term Effects of Different Dihydropyridines on Sympathetic and Baroreflex Function in Hypertension,"<jats:p>
            Antihypertensive treatment with dihydropyridines may be accompanied by sympathetic activation. Data on whether this is common to all compounds and similar in the various phases of treatment are not univocal, however. In 28 untreated essential hypertensives (age, 56.4±1.8 years; mean±SEM) finger blood pressure (BP, Finapres), heart rate (HR, ECG), plasma norepinephrine (NE, high-performance liquid chromatography), and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA, microneurography) were measured at rest and during baroreceptor manipulation (vasoactive drugs) in the placebo run-in period and after randomization to double-blind acute and chronic (8 weeks) felodipine (10 mg/d, n=14) or lercanidipine (10 mg/d, n=14). Acute administration of both drugs induced pronounced BP reductions and marked increases in HR, NE, and MSNA. After 8 weeks of treatment, BP reductions were similar to those observed after acute administration, whereas HR, NE, and MSNA responses were markedly attenuated (−7%, −32%, and −14%, respectively;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.05). There was a small residual increase in sympathetic activity in the felodipine group, whereas in the lercanidipine group, all adrenergic markers returned to baseline values. Baroreflex control of HR and MSNA was markedly impaired (−42% and −48%, respectively) after acute drug administration, with a recovery and complete resetting during chronic treatment. Thus, the sympathoexcitation induced by 2 different dihydropyridines is largely limited to the acute administration. The 2 drugs have, nevertheless, a different chronic sympathetic effect, indicating that dihydropyridines do not homogeneously affect this function. The acute sympathoexcitation, but not the small between-drugs differential chronic adrenergic effect, is accounted for by baroreflex impairment.

Stroke Units – The Norwegian Experience,"<jats:p>The main aims of acute stroke care should be to reduce death and disability. Treatment in stroke units is the only treatment option proven to reduce death in acute stroke patients. Stroke unit care is also the only treatment which has shown a marked reduction in disability for general stroke patients, and also the only treatment with beneficial long-term effects on survival, disability and quality of life. Most acute hospitals in Norway have established stroke units. The recommended stroke unit model is a non-intensive combined unit able to focus simultaneously both on acute care and rehabilitation. This model has been very well evaluated in randomised trials and has achieved some of the best results regarding acute stroke care. Hence one can probably conclude that stroke unit care in Norway is evidence based.</jats:p>",0

Effects of the Selective Aldosterone Blocker Eplerenone Versus the Calcium Antagonist Amlodipine in Systolic Hypertension,"<jats:p>
            Eplerenone is a highly selective aldosterone blocker, which is under development for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. To assess its usefulness in older patients with systolic hypertension and widened pulse pressure, we compared the effects of eplerenone with amlodipine, on clinic blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure and in a subset of the patients, ambulatory BP, vascular compliance, and urinary albumin excretion. The study involved 269 patients ≥50 years of age who were randomly assigned to either eplerenone (50 to 200 mg daily) or amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg daily) in a double-blind titration to effect design. After 24 weeks of therapy, reductions in clinic systolic BP were similar for both treatments (eplerenone, −20.5±1.1 mm Hg; amlodipine, −20.1±1.1 mm Hg). Reductions in clinic diastolic BP were modestly larger on amlodipine (−6.9±0.7 mm Hg) compared with eplerenone (−4.5±0.7 mm Hg) (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.014). Pulse pressure was also reduced similarly from baseline by the 2 treatment groups (eplerenone, −15.9 mm Hg versus amlodipine, −13.4 mm Hg,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.07). Changes from baseline in pulse wave velocity after 24 weeks of therapy were statistically similar for eplerenone and amlodipine. In patients with microalbuminuria at baseline (&gt;30 mg albumin/g creatinine), eplerenone reduced the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio by 52% compared with a reduction of 10% by amlodipine (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.04). Thus, eplerenone was as effective as amlodipine in lowering systolic BP and pulse pressure as well as pulse wave velocity in older patients with widened pulse pressure hypertension. Furthermore, eplerenone reduced microalbuminuria to a greater extent than amlodipine in this older patient group.

Effects of nicardipine and clonidine on cognitive functions and electroencephalography in hypertensive patients,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive and electroencephalography (EEG) short‐term effects of a calcium antagonist, nicardipine, compared to placebo and clonidine (which, having known sedative effects, acted as a negative control) for 15 days in elderly hypertensive patients with memory complaints. Nicardipine and clonidine were compared with placebo in a double‐blind, randomized, three‐way cross‐over controlled study after a 2‐week placebo run‐in period. This was a phase II clinical study carried out on out‐patients in a single research centre. Fifteen elderly (63 ± 10 years) hypertensive patients, without dementia but with memory complaints, were included. Psychomotor performance and cognition were assessed using both an extensive battery of validated psychometric tests (which evaluated attention and vigilance, body sway and memory) and an EEG profile. Cardiovascular parameters measured were blood pressure and heart rate. No detrimental effects of nicardipine were found on attention, vigilance, body sway or memory. Nicardipine produced a significant increase in alpha EEG energies, which may indicate possible alerting effects. In contrast, clonidine induced well‐known deleterious sedative effects in psychometric tests and in EEG analysis (decrease in alpha and increase in delta and theta waves). The two drugs produced equivalent decreases in blood pressure at steady state. In conclusion, clonidine induced well‐known sedative effects, while nicardipine did not impair central nervous system activity and may have had some short‐term alerting effects in elderly hypertensive patients with memory complaints. This study supports the hypothesis of a dissociation between blood pressure and direct drug effects on the central nervous system.</jats:p>",0
"Randomized, comparative, double‐blind study of amlodipine vs. nicardipine as a treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A 90‐day, multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group study was conducted to compare the efficacy of amlodipine (once a day) with nicardipine (two to three times a day), in the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in the elderly. Patients (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 133) aged ≥60 years, with ISH were randomized to receive either amlodipine 5 mg/day, or nicardipine 60 mg/day (titrated if necessary to 10 mg/day and 100 mg/day, respectively) for 90 days. Efficacy was assessed by measuring office blood pressure (BP), and 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The two treatments substantially and comparably reduced office systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP), and also produced a slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Amlodipine reduced SBP, as assessed by ABPM, to a significantly greater extent than nicardipine. Both treatments were well‐tolerated. The sustained effect of amlodipine, compared with nicardipine, was reflected in its significantly greater antihypertensive activity, particularly during the nocturnal period, as assessed by ABPM. The study demonstrates that once a day dose of amlodipine is an effective antihypertensive treatment for elderly ISH patients.</jats:p>",0

Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease is a clinicopathological condition that comprises a wide spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis represents only a stage within the spectrum of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease and is defined pathologically by the presence of steatosis together with necro‐inflammatory activity. The true prevalence of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease is unknown, but it is estimated that it affects 10–24% of the general population in different countries. The diagnosis of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease is based upon convincing evidence of absent or minimal alcohol consumption, compatible histological changes in liver biopsy and the exclusion of other liver diseases. The natural history of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease remains to be defined. Patients with pure steatosis on liver biopsy follow a relatively benign course, whereas patients with histological necro‐inflammatory changes and/or fibrosis may progress to end‐stage liver disease. An initial step in the treatment of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease is the management of associated conditions, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia. Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease patients with steatohepatitis and/or fibrosis on liver biopsy may benefit from investigational pharmacological therapy. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis from non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease may be candidates for liver transplantation.</jats:p>",0

Different Effect of Antihypertensive Drugs on Conduit Artery Endothelial Function,"<jats:p>
            To compare the effect of antihypertensive drugs on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the peripheral conduit arteries of patients with essential hypertension, in a prospective, randomized, parallel group study, endothelial function was assessed in 168 hypertensive patients before and after 6-month treatment with randomly assigned nifedipine GITS (30 to 60 mg, n=28), amlodipine (5 to 10 mg, n=28), atenolol (50 to 100 mg, n=29), nebivolol (5 to 10 mg, n=28), telmisartan (80 to 160 mg, n=29), and perindopril (2 to 4 mg, n=28). If necessary, hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) was added to each compound. We evaluated brachial artery flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation (high-resolution ultrasound) compared with endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate (25 μg/s). Brachial artery diameter was measured by automatic computerized analysis. Forty healthy subjects were evaluated as a control group. Oxidative stress production was evaluated by measuring plasma malondialdehyde and plasma lipoperoxides; plasma antioxidant capacity was assessed as ferric-reducing antioxidant power. Hypertensive patients showed a significantly (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.01) lower flow-mediated dilation (5.2±1.9%) as compared with healthy control subjects (7.1±2.6%). Response to glyceryl trinitrate was similar in control subjects and patients. At baseline, blood pressure, diameter, flow-mediated dilation, and response to glyceryl trinitrate were similar in the different treatment groups. All treatments similarly reduced blood pressure, but only perindopril increased flow mediated dilation (from 5.1±2 to 6.4±2.4%;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;0.01) without modifying the response to glyceryl trinitrate. Perindopril but also telmisartan nifedipine and amlodipine reduced oxidative stress and increased plasma antioxidant capacity. In patients with essential hypertension, ACE inhibitors appear to be the only compounds able to improve conduit artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation.

Interaction of alcohol and drugs in fatal poisonings,"<jats:p> In Finnish data from 1995 / 2000, 1006 fatal poisonings due to alcohol (ethanol), a single drug or both were statistically analysed in retrospect to evaluate the interaction between alcohol and drugs. In 53% of these cases, low concentrations of some common benzodiazepines were present. The median postmortem blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 3.3 (w/w) in the 615 alcohol poisonings, but significantly lower, ranging from 1.3 to 1.7, when promazine, doxepin, amitriptyline or propoxyphene were found together with alcohol. When levomepromazine, temazepam or zopiclone were present, the median BAC was also significantly lower, 2.5 trations of a drug (excluding citalopram), suggesting a positive concentration <jats:sup>/</jats:sup> effect relationship. Fatal toxicity indices (FTIs) were calculated by relating the number of deaths caused by a drug to the corresponding sales figures. Promazine had an extremely high FTI, followed by levomepromazine, propoxyphene, doxepin and amitriptyline. The other drugs had relatively low FTIs. The results reflect not only the acute toxicity of a given drug / alcohol combination but also the manners of use and abuse of these drugs. </jats:p>",0

The Importance of von Willebrand Factor Level and Heart Rate Changes in Acute Coronary Syndromes: A Comparison with Chronic Ischemic Conditions,"<jats:p> The pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and transient myocardial ischemia (TMI) is not completely understood. Therefore, the authors studied the biological indicators of throm bogenesis and sympathetic activity. The study was conducted on 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome and 30 patients with stable angina pectoris. Treatment was standardized with low-molecular-weight heparin and 300 mg aspirin/day but with no IIb/IIIa inhibitors, an oral β-blocker, diltiazem 60 mg tid, glyceryl trinitrate IV in patients with ACS but with monon itrates orally and low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with stable angina. Twenty-four- hour continuous ECG monitoring and ST segment analysis were performed on day 2 of admission and heart rate analysis was performed 10, 5, and 1 minute before and during the myocardial ischemia periods. Blood sampling for von Willebrand factor (vWf) determination was performed through a peripheral vein at 8 AM, noon, 6 PM and 10 PM and half an hour after the description of angina. The patients with ACS were grouped as transient myocardial ischemia positive (n = 20) and negative (n = 30). The patients with stable angina were desig nated as the control group (n = 30). The detected vWf levels at 4 different daytime periods in patients with ACS were significantly higher than those in patients with stable angina. At the 6 PM to 10 PM period, the vWf level increase was significantly higher in patients with TMI than in the patients without TMI. At the 8 AM to noon period, the detected vWf levels decreased significantly in both TMI groups. During the nocturnal ischemia periods, the increase in vWf levels immediately after angina was significantly more apparent than the detected changes during daytime ischemia. Analysis showed that heart rates before the ischemia during stable angina episodes were significantly higher than those in TMI (-) (silent) angina. The heart rate difference between 10 minutes before and during the ischemia in the angina group was signif icantly different from that during TMI (-) (silent) ischemia. The heart rates at the times related to ischemia in the nocturnal period were significantly lower than those in the daytime period. The heart rate differences between the ischemia-related times and during the ischemia were significantly higher in daytime ischemic attacks than in nocturnal ischemic attacks. The study confirms that the vWf level, which is an indicator of thrombogenesis, was significantly increased in patients with ACS. Nocturnal ischemia is associated with thrombogenesis. Daytime ischemia is associated with increased sympathetic activity, and symptomatic ischemia is usually associated with increased sympathetic activity. </jats:p>",0
The role of topical diltiazem in the treatment of chronic anal fissures that have failed glyceryl trinitrate therapy,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p><jats:bold>Objective </jats:bold> The treatment of anal fissures has evolved over the last 5 years with the development of topical treatments aimed at reducing sphincter hypertonia. This is thought to improve anal mucosal blood flow and promote healing of the fissure. This study reports the use of topical diltiazem in patients with chronic anal fissures that have failed previous treatment with topical 0.2% glyceryl trinitrate (GTN).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Patients and methods </jats:bold> Forty‐seven patients with chronic anal fissure who had previously failed at least one course of topical GTN were recruited prospectively from a single centre. Patients were instructed to apply 2 cm (approximately 0.7 g) of 2% diltiazem cream to the anal verge twice daily for eight weeks. Symptoms of pain, bleeding and itching were recorded on a linear analogue score prior to starting the cream and then repeated at 2 weekly intervals. Patients were asked to report side‐effects throughout the study period. Healing of the fissure was assessed after 8 weeks of treatment.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> Forty‐six patients completed treatment; of these, 22 had healed fissures (48%). Ten of the 24 patients with persistent fissures were symptomatically improved and wished no further treatment. Of the 14 patients who remained symptomatic, one was given a repeat course of 0.2% glyceryl trinitrate with subsequent healing of the fissure, 10 were recruited into an ongoing study involving injections of botulinum toxin into the internal anal sphincter and three were referred for surgery.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion </jats:bold> This study shows that topical 2% diltiazem is an effective and safe treatment for chronic anal fissure in patients who have failed topical 0.2% GTN. The need for sphincterotomy can be avoided in up to 70% of cases.</jats:p>",0

Braxton‐Hicks contractions can alter uteroplacental perfusion,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Color flow imaging was used to study the effect of spontaneous low‐amplitude uterine contractions (Braxton‐Hicks) on flow velocity waveforms obtained from the main uterine artery in 13 women between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation. Eight women had abnormal waveforms, as defined by the presence of an early diastolic notch, and five women had normal waveforms. In the former group, three women with chronic hypertension were started on the calcium antagonist nifedipine during this study. Contractions, which were monitored by external tocography, occurred more frequently in the group with abnormal waveforms and were temporally associated with an increase in impedance to blood flow. This effect occurred to the same degree in both normal and abnormal groups, but in the abnormal group the already impaired blood flow to the intervillous space was further diminished, resulting in absence of forward flow in diastole. Such acute reductions of flow in response to frequent, impalpable uterine contractions may cause a prolonged and silent insult to uteroplacental perfusion, which could hasten fetal compromise. This effect appeared to be abolished in patients on nifedipine, suggesting a possible therapeutic role for this drug in uteroplacental insufficiency.

Response to Six Classes of Antihypertensive Medications by Body Mass Index in a Randomized Controlled Trial,"<jats:p> <jats:italic>Blood pressure increases with increasing body mass index (BMI) and BMI is linearly related to blood pressure in population studies.

Achieving Goal Blood Pressure in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: Conventional Versus Fixed‐Dose Combination Approaches,"<jats:p> <jats:italic>Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) demonstrate that only 11% of people with diabetes who are treated for high blood pressure achieve the blood pressure goal of &lt;130/85 mm Hg recommended in the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI). The current study tests the hypothesis that initial therapy with a fixed‐dose combination will achieve the recommended blood pressure goal in patients with type 2 diabetes faster than conventional monotherapy. This randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study had as a primary end point achievement of blood pressure &lt;130/85 mm Hg. Participants (N=214) with hypertension and type 2 diabetes received either amlodipine/benazepril 5/10 mg (combination) or enalapril 10 mg (conventional) once daily for 4 weeks, titrated to 5/20 mg/day or 20 mg/day, respectively at this time, if target blood pressure was not achieved. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg/day was added for the final 4 weeks, if target blood pressure was still not reached. Time from baseline to achieve blood pressure &lt;130/85 mm Hg was shorter in the combination group (5.3±3.1 weeks combination vs. 6.4±3.8 weeks conventional;</jats:italic> p<jats:italic>=0.001). At 3 months, more participants in the combination group achieved treatment goal (63% combination vs. 37% conventional;</jats:italic> p<jats:italic>=0.002). Data analysis at 3 months comparing blood pressure control rates between the fixed‐dose combination group (with out HCTZ) to the conventional group (receiving HCTZ) showed an even greater disparity in blood pressure goal achievement (87% combination without HCTZ vs. 37% conventional group with HCTZ;</jats:italic> p<jats:italic>=0.0001). We conclude that initial therapy with a fixed‐dose combination may be more efficacious than conventional monotherapy approaches for achieving blood pressure goals in the diabetic patient.

Preterm delivery: an overview,"<jats:p>Preterm delivery is the leading factor causing neonatal mortality and morbidity. We have conducted a PubMed literature search to obtain an update on the etiology, diagnostic problems and therapeutic considerations of preterm delivery. Approximately 5–10% of all births are premature. Preterm labor is associated with preterm rupture of membranes, cervical incompetence, polyhydramnion, fetal and uterine anomalies, infections, social factors, stress, smoking, heavy work and other risk factors. The diagnosis is made on the patients presenting symptoms, clinical findings and of progressive effacement and dilatation of the cervix. Biochemical markers of preterm delivery are of minor importance in daily clinical work. Measurement of the cervix, however, is a practical and valuable tool to predict preterm delivery. Cervical cerclage can be useful in selected cases. Antibiotics may help to prevent preterm labor in cases of known etiologic agents (e.g. preterm rupture of membranes and urinary infection). The use of tocolytic agents such as β‐sympathetic receptor stimulators can be advocated for a few days. There is evidence that their long‐term use is not beneficial and could even be harmful to the fetus. Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) and a new selective oxytocin receptor antagonist, atosiban, appear to be as effective as β‐sympathomimetic drugs on uterine contractions with fewer side‐effects. Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors such as indomethacin may prevent uterine contractions and can be used prior to the 32nd week of pregnancy. A single course of corticosteroid treatment in two doses of 12 mg betamethasone or 6 mg of dexamethasone is important for the prevention of respiratory distress between the 24th and 34th weeks of pregnancy. Multiple doses may be harmful and should be avoided. In these cases management should depend on gestation age (fetal maturity).

Treatment of Hypertension in Older Patients: An Updated Look at the Role of Calcium Antagonists,"<jats:p> <jats:bold>
            <jats:italic>Hypertension is common in adults aged 60 years or older. Apart from age, hypertension is the most powerful predictor of cardiovascular end‐organ damage and its associated morbidity and mortality. Although diastolic blood pressure is regarded as an important risk factor, it is now clear that systolic blood pressure, especially prevalent among older adults, is a better predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Fewer than 30% of hypertensive patients have blood pressure levels controlled to &lt;140/90 mm Hg as recommended by current guidelines. Controlled trials have demonstrated the benefits of lowering blood pressure for all hypertensive individuals, including those aged 65 years or older. Calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine subclass, which include nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, and nitrendipine, as well as other drug classes, are potent antihypertensive agents that may be suitable for treatment of hypertension in older adults. However, as with all antihypertensive agents, adverse effects may limit their use; peripheral edema is particularly troublesome for dihydropyridines. Newer dihydropyridine calcium antagonists expected to be approved for use soon, including lercanidipine and lacidipine, have been associated with efficacy comparable to currently available calcium antagonists but with a lower incidence of adverse effects, especially ankle edema. Antihypertensive agents with improved tolerability profiles offer the potential for improved blood pressure control.</jats:italic>

              <jats:italic>Background—</jats:italic>
            </jats:bold>
            Elevated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity correlates with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and cardiovascular risk, but the relative contributions of angiotensin II and aldosterone remain unclear. This study compared LVH regression during treatment with the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone, enalapril, and their combination in patients with hypertension.

              <jats:italic>Methods and Results—</jats:italic>
            </jats:bold>
            A 9-month, double-blind, randomized study was performed in 202 patients with LVH and hypertension who received eplerenone 200 mg daily, enalapril 40 mg daily, or eplerenone 200 mg and enalapril 10 mg daily. At week 8, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg and/or amlodipine 10 mg was added if diastolic blood pressure was &gt;90 mm Hg. Change in left ventricular (LV) mass as assessed by MRI was the primary end point. Change in blood pressure, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hormones, albuminuria, and safety were also assessed. Eplerenone significantly reduced LV mass from baseline (−14.5±3.36 g; n=50) similarly to enalapril (−19.7±3.20 g; n=54;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.258), but eplerenone/enalapril (−27.2±3.39 g; n=49) was more effective than eplerenone alone (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.007). All treatments reduced systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from baseline (eplerenone, −23.8 and −11.9 mm Hg; enalapril, −24.7 and −13.4 mm Hg; and eplerenone/enalapril, −28.7 and −14.4 mm Hg,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.048, in systolic blood pressure compared with eplerenone alone). Cough was more common with enalapril than with eplerenone (

            </jats:bold>
            Eplerenone was as effective as enalapril in LVH regression and blood pressure control. The combination of eplerenone and enalapril was more effective in reducing LV mass and systolic blood pressure than eplerenone alone.

                  <jats:p>After a 6-week placebo baseline period, 102 hypertensive NIDDM patients were randomly assigned, double-blindly, to treatment with nifedipine retard (slow release) (n = 52) or enalapril (n = 50). The daily dosage of enalapril was increased, if required, from 10 to 20 to 40 mg and that of nifedipine from 40 to 60 to 80 mg at 4-week intervals during the 12-week titration period. Blood pressure, 24-h urinary albumin excretion (UAE), biochemical data, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity were measured at weeks −6, −4, 0, 4, 8, and 12. At week 0, venous blood was also sampled for baseline plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, renin, aldosterone, and serum insulin concentrations.</jats:p>
               </jats:sec>
               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>At week 12, the mean daily dose of enalapril was 35 ± 11.4 mg, and 27 (57%) patients were receiving the maximum daily dose of 40 mg. In the nifedipine group, the mean daily drug dose was 50 ± 12.9 mg, and 4 (8%) were receiving the maximum daily dose of 80 mg. Despite a dose-dependent fall in the serum ACE activity in the enalapril group, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced by only 8 mmHg throughout the 12-week titration period compared to a decline of 15, 18, and 19 mmHg at weeks 0, 4, and 12, respectively, in the nifedipine group (P = 0.01 between groups). In the enalapril group, changes in MAP between weeks 0 and 12 correlated significantly with baseline plasma glucose (r = 0.45, P = 0.001) and aldosterone concentrations (r = −0.32, P = 0.02) and UAE (r = 0.3, P = 0.04). There was no statistically significant correlation between the changes in MAP and baseline plasma renin concentration. On multivariate analysis, the baseline renal function, glycemic control, and plasma aldosterone and serum insulin concentrations were all independently related to the changes in blood pressure in the enalapril-treated patients. No such statistical associations were observed in the nifedipine group.</jats:p>

                  <jats:p>In hypertensive NIDDM patients, the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the level of serum insulin, glycemic control, renal function, and proteinuria may be important determinants of the blood pressure response to ACE inhibition. Good glycemic control may optimize the antihypertensive efficacy of concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy.</jats:p>

After a 2-week placebo wash-out, 34 patients (19 men, 15 women, mean age 49 years) with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure range 95 – 110 mmHg) were treated with 5 mg sustained-release isradipine for 4 weeks and 4 mg lacidipine for 4 weeks in a random order. Medications were taken once daily at 08.00 h. Clinic and ambulatory blood pressures were recorded at the end of each placebo or treatment period. Two patients stopped isradipine and six lacidipine because of severe adverse effects. Clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by an average of 17/14 mmHg with isradipine and 17/13 mmHg with lacidipine, compared with placebo ( P &lt; 0.01 in both cases), without a change in heart rate. Mean ambulatory 24-h and daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced by sustained-release isradipine and lacidipine ( P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively). At night systolic blood pressure fell compared with placebo ( P &lt; 0.05 with both drugs) whereas the reduction in diastolic blood pressure was not statistically significant. Mean 24-h heart rate remained unchanged. Blood-pressure variability did not differ significantly between the two drugs or between either drug and the placebo. The antihypertensive effects of sustained-release isradipine and lacidipine were similar, but the tolerability of isradipine appears to be greater since it caused fewer withdrawals. </jats:p>",0

Diltiazem: Ten Years of Clinical Experience in the Treatment of Hypertension,"<jats:p>Diltiazem hydrochloride is a benzothiazepine derivative calcium‐channel blocker with proven antianginal and antihypertensive capabilities. Its primary mechanism of action is vasodilatation, which results in diminished vascular resistance and improved perfusion to various vascular beds and target organs. The antihypertensive efficacy of diltiazem in various demographic groups has been studied and compared with diuretics, β‐blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, and other calcium‐channel blockers. These studies have shown that the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is similar to that of the other therapies. Diltiazem does not adversely affect electrolytes or carbohydrate or lipid metabolism, and it may have beneficial effects on the heart and kidneys. Diltiazem reduces myocardial hypertrophy and exerts antianginal effects on the heart through coronary vasodilation and reduction in the blood pressure double product. Diltiazem improves renal perfusion and attenuates proteinuria. These effects may be helpful in limiting the progression of renal injury. Overall, the efficacy and tolerability of diltiazem, as well as its salutary effects on the heart and kidneys, make it an important therapeutic consideration for patients with hypertensive disease.</jats:p>",0
Sustained Blood Pressure Control with Controlled‐Release Isradipine (Isradipine‐CR),"<jats:p><jats:italic>The safety and efficacy, as measured by peak/trough blood pressure reduction, of a new, once‐daily, controlled‐release formulation of isradipine (isradipine‐CR, ICR) were evaluated in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension during a nine‐week trial. After a 3‐week placebo washout period, patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 114 mm Hg were randomized to either 1 of 4 ICR treatment groups or placebo. Of 402 randomized patients, 384 completed the study (placebo = 77, ICR‐5 mg = 76, ICR‐10 mg = 76, ICR‐15 mg = 78, and ICR‐20 mg = 77). Peak and trough post‐dose blood pressure responses and heart rates were monitored for both the sitting and upright positions. Blood chemistries, urinalyses, complete blood counts, and electrocardiograms were done during the study. Both sitting and upright blood pressures decreased with the 5‐ (</jats:italic>P &lt; <jats:italic>.05), 10‐, 15‐, and 20‐mg (</jats:italic>P &lt; <jats:italic>.001) once‐daily ICR doses. The peak blood pressure reduction for all ICR doses occurred at 8 to 10 hours post‐dose. Maximum peak/trough blood pressure response, achieved with the 10‐mg dose, was similar with that of 15 and 20 mg of ICR. No serious clinical or metabolic side effects were noted, except ankle edema, which was dose dependent but did not require discontinuation of treatment. Based on these results we concluded that (1) ICR provided effective peak and trough blood pressure control after once‐daily dosing (5–20 mg) in hypertensive patients, (2) it was safe and well tolerated, and (3) the best overall results were achieved with the 10‐mg once‐daily dose</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0

Exercise testing was performed at baseline after a 7 day placebo run‐in period, and repeated after 7 days of treatment, 25.0 +/‐ 0.1 h postdose. 3. Diltiazem (200 and 300 mg) produced respectively a 68% and a 64% decrease in weekly angina episodes, and placebo a 15% decrease (P &lt; 0.05). Similarly, both dose levels produced a 70% decrease in nitroglycerin consumption, whereas no difference was obtained with placebo (P &lt; 0.01). The increase in time to ischaemic threshold was significantly superior for 200 mg and 300 mg diltiazem when compared with placebo (75.2 and 91.5 s respectively vs 47.0 s) (P &lt; 0.05); increase in time to anginal threshold was also significantly greater for diltiazem when compared with placebo (84.6 and 85.9 s respectively vs 43.9 s) (P &lt; 0.05). 4. Only one patient experienced worsening of angina and had to be withdrawn from the study. 5. This study demonstrates 200 and 300 mg SR diltiazem is effective when given once‐a‐day in the prophylaxis of stable exertional angina. This once daily formulation should improve patients' compliance and comfort.</jats:p>",0

Phase I/II trial of dexverapamil plus vinblastine for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.,"<jats:sec><jats:title>PURPOSE</jats:title><jats:p> The reduced cardiac toxicity of the dextro-(d-) stereoisomer of verapamil (dexverapamil; Knoll Pharmaceuticals, Whippany, NJ) warrants its study as a potential multidrug-resistance (MDR) reversal agent. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</jats:title><jats:p> Twenty-three patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were treated with vinblastine at a dose of 0.11 mg/kg intravenous (IV) bolus injection on days 1 and 2 every 21 days. Dexverapamil was added to subsequent cycles after resistance had been demonstrated. Dexverapamil treatment was begun 18 hours before day 1 of vinblastine administration and was given orally every 6 hours for 12 doses. Patients in group A were treated with a dose of 120 mg/m2, and those in group B were treated with 180 mg/m2 plus dexamethasone; plasma concentrations achieved in patients were correlated with in vitro effects. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title><jats:p> Toxicities included hypotension, asymptomatic bradycardia, and mild atrioventricular conduction delays, although one patient had dexverapamil discontinued for grade IV congestive heart failure. There were no partial or complete responses. The mean day-1 serum dexverapamil plus norverapamil plasma concentrations were 2,575 ng/mL (range, 697 to 6,015 ng/mL) for group A and 1,654 ng/mL (range, 710 to 4,132 ng/mL) for group B at the time of vinblastine administration. These concentrations were in the range of those that reversed vinblastine resistance in vitro. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSION</jats:title><jats:p> The advantage of dexverapamil as an MDR reversal agent is its potential for achieving desired blood levels with substantially less toxicity than the racemic mixture of verapamil. Based on tolerability, it is a suitable drug for further study in clinical trials of malignancies other than RCC that attempt to achieve MDR reversal. The dose of 120 mg/m2 given orally every 6 hours, with dose escalation based on individual tolerance, represents a feasible schedule to be considered for such studies. </jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Nifedipine,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Background</jats:italic>
            The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the dose of nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on the increased risk of mortality seen in the randomized secondary-prevention trials and to review the mechanisms by which this adverse effect might occur.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            We restricted the dose-response meta-analysis to the 16 randomized secondary-prevention trials of nifedipine for which mortality data were available. Recent trials of any calcium antagonist and formulation were also reviewed for information about the possible mechanisms of action that might increase mortality. Overall, the use of nifedipine was associated with a significant adverse effect on total mortality (risk ratio, 1.16, with a 95% CI of 1.01 to 1.33). This summary estimate fails to draw attention to an important dose-response relationship. For daily doses of 30 to 50, 60, and 80 mg, the risk ratios for total mortality were 1.06 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.27), 1.18 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.50), and 2.83 (95% CI, 1.35 to 5.93), respectively. In a formal test of dose response, the high doses of nifedipine were significantly associated with increased mortality (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.01). While the mechanism of this adverse effect is not known, there are several plausible explanations, including the established proischemic effect, negative inotropic effects, marked hypotension, recently reported prohemorrhagic effects attributed to antiplatelet and vasodilatory actions of calcium antagonists, and possibly proarrhythmic effects.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            In patients with coronary disease, the use of short-acting nifedipine in moderate to high doses causes an increase in total mortality. Other calcium antagonists may have similar adverse effects, in particular those of the dihydropyridine type. Long-term safety data are lacking for most calcium antagonists.

A Multicenter Comparison of Adverse Reaction Profiles of Isradipine and Enalapril at Equipotent Doses in Patients with Essential Hypertension,"<jats:p>A multicenter, randomized, double‐blind trial compared the safety and efficacy of the dihydropyridine isradipine with the angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril given twice daily for mild hypertension. 160 patients received either isradipine (starting at 1.25 mg twice daily) or enalapril (starting at 2.5 mg twice daily) for 10 weeks. The dosage was increased if the average sitting diastolic blood pressure was &gt; 90 mm Hg. Significantly greater mean reductions in systolic blood pressure were seen after 2, 6, and 8 weeks of isradipine. However, by the end of the trial, 83% of patients receiving isradipine and 78% receiving enalapril showed a decrease of at least 5 mm Hg in sitting diastolic blood pressure to a level below 96 mm Hg. Possible or probable drug‐related adverse effects were reported in 36% of patients showing a good antihypertensive response to isradipine, and in 30% of those who responded to enalapril. There was a trend for a lower frequency of adverse effects in isradipine non‐responders (25%) and a higher frequency in enalapril non‐responders (43%). Pruritus, dizziness, edema, and fatigue were reported more often with isradipine, and cough and changed bowel habits were more common with enalapril. The relationship between the pattern of adverse effects and the extent of blood pressure reduction may be dependent on the mechanism of action of a drug. In responders, isradipine and enalapril showed differing patterns, but a similar overall incidence of adverse effects.</jats:p>",0

Effects of different antihypertensive drugs on plasma fibrinogen in hypertensive patients.,"<jats:p>1. In order to evaluate whether treatment with different antihypertensive drugs would affect plasma fibrinogen levels, 118 mild to moderate essential hypertensive subjects, all males, aged 18 to 65 years, were randomly treated with amlodipine 10 mg, atenolol 100 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg or lisinopril 20 mg, all given once daily for 8 weeks. 2. Before and after 8 weeks' treatment, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), fibrinogen, total cholesterol (TC), HDL‐C, LDL‐C, triglycerides (TG), plasma glucose, plasma uric acid, serum creatinine and serum potassium were evaluated. 3. All four medications significantly reduced BP values, although the BP lowering effect of lisinopril, amlodipine and atenolol was significantly greater compared with that of hydrochlorothiazide. 4. Plasma fibrinogen levels were unaffected by atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine, whereas they were significantly decreased by lisinopril (‐11.2%, P = 0.002). This fibrinogen lowering effect was more evident in smokers (‐17.7%) than in non smokers (‐7.4%). 5. Atenolol and amlodipine did not significantly affect plasma lipids, hydrochlorothiazide increased TC, LDL‐C and TG and reduced HDL‐C; lisinopril increased HDL‐C and decreased TC and LDL‐C. 6. Hydrochlorothiazide increased plasma glucose and uric acid concentrations, which were unaffected by the other drugs. The diuretic also reduced serum potassium. 7. The results of this study indicate that lisinopril reduces levels of plasma fibrinogen and confirm that different antihypertensive drugs may elicit different metabolic effects, which may variously influence the overall risk profile of the hypertensive patients.</jats:p>",0

Effectiveness of Enalapril Versus Nifedipine to Antagonize Blood Pressure and the Renal Response to Endothelin in Humans,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic>
            Endothelin-1 infusion into humans to obtain pathophysiological plasma levels causes mild hypertension, strong renal vasoconstriction, and sodium retention. We studied whether oral use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg BID) or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (60 mg OD) could attenuate these effects of endothelin-1 (2.5 ng/kg per minute for 90 minutes) in six healthy volunteers. Endothelin infusion alone increased plasma endothelin from 3.0±0.3 to 8.8±1.0 pmol/L (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05). Blood pressure rose by approximately 6 mm Hg (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05). Renal function changes were relatively large: Renal blood flow decreased from 941±76 to 729±118 mL/min (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05) and glomerular filtration rate from 105±9 to 92±10 mL/min (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05); renal vascular resistance increased from 101±7 to 152±20 mm Hg · min/L (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05); and sodium excretion decreased from 158±54 to 86±27 μmol/min (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05). Enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure from 94±2 to 87±3 mm Hg (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05) and prevented the hypertensive response to endothelin. By contrast, despite renal predilatation, endothelin reduced renal blood flow strongly (from 1063±127 to 763±100 mL/min,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05), although maximal renal vascular resistance was numerically lower (124±11 mm Hg · min/L) than during endothelin alone (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05). Glomerular filtration rate fell from 118±11 to 108±11 mL/min (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05). Enalapril did not alter the antinatriuretic effect of endothelin. Nifedipine did not affect blood pressure but prevented the increase caused by endothelin. The endothelin-induced fall in renal blood flow (from 1084±100 to 888±65 mL/min,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05) was less than during endothelin infusion alone (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05), and maximal renal vascular resistance (111±7 mm Hg · min/L) was lower than in both other experiments (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05), whereas glomerular filtration rate was maintained. Nifedipine increased basal sodium excretion (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05), which compensated for the decrease observed during superimposed endothelin infusion. In conclusion, both enalapril and nifedipine can counteract the hypertensive effect of endothelin, but nifedipine is more effective in antagonizing the renal effects of endothelin.

Calcium‐Channel Entry Blocker Therapy for Hypertensive Patients with Concomitant Renal Impairment: A Focus on Isradipine,"<jats:p>In the treatment of hypertension in renally impaired patients, normalization of blood pressure alone may not be sufficient to prevent significant morbidity to the kidneys. Treatment must reduce pressure in the renal vasculature, otherwise glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow will continue to deteriorate. Isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium‐channel blocker, has been investigated as a suitable treatment in this setting. Isradipine maintains glomerular filtration rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium‐channel blockers, isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose‐dependent manner.</jats:p>",0

"Dose‐Ranging Study of a New, Once‐Daily Diltiazem Formulation for Patients with Stable Angina","<jats:p>A double‐blind safety and efficacy dose‐ranging study was conducted with a new, once‐daily, extended‐release (XR) diltiazem hydrochloride formulation (Dilacor XR®, Rhǒne‐Poulenc Rorer, Collegeville, PA) in 189 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. After a 2‐week placebo lead‐in phase, the patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 once‐daily, fixed‐dose treatment groups: placebo, XR diltiazem 120 mg, 240 mg, or 480 mg. Extended‐release diltiazem, at 240‐mg and 480‐mg once‐daily doses, significantly improved (P &lt; .05) total exercise time during treadmill exercise tolerance testing after 2 weeks of treatment when assessed 24 hours after the previous dose. These increasing doses of XR diltiazem were associated with incremental improvements in exercise tolerance. Outpatient function, as assessed by frequency of anginal attacks, nitroglycerin use, and ambulatory electrocardiogram (Holter, Scole Engineering Culver City, CA) monitoring of ischemic events, was also improved by XR diltiazem. This extended‐release diltiazem formulation can be clinically titrated within the 120‐ to 480‐mg dosing range, permitting effective once‐daily administration for treating chronic stable angina.</jats:p>",0

            Increased left ventricular mass (LVM) by echocardiography is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, it is of interest to compare the effects of both pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to the treatment of hypertension on reduction of LVM.

            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            Changes in LV structure were assessed by M-mode echocardiograms in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 844 mild hypertensive participants randomized to nutritional-hygienic (NH) intervention plus placebo or NH plus one of five classes of antihypertensive agents: (1) diuretic (chlorthalidone), (2) β-blocker (acebutolol), (3) α-antagonist (doxazosin mesylate), (4) calcium antagonist (amlodipine maleate), or (5) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate). Echocardiograms were performed at baseline, at 3 months, and annually for 4 years. Changes in blood pressure averaged 16/12 mm Hg in the active treatment groups and 9/9 mm Hg in the NH only group. All groups showed significant decreases (10% to 15%) in LVM from baseline that appeared at 3 months and continued for 48 months. The chlorthalidone group experienced the greatest decrease at each follow-up visit (average decrease, 34 g), although the differences from other groups were modest (average decrease among 5 other groups, 24 to 27 g). Participants randomized to NH intervention only had mean changes in LVM similar to those in the participants randomized to NH intervention plus pharmacological treatment. The greatest difference between groups was seen at 12 months, with mean decreases ranging from 35 g (chlorthalidone group) to 17 g (acebutolol group) (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.001 comparing all groups). Within-group analysis showed that changes in weight, urinary sodium excretion, and systolic BP were moderately correlated with changes in LVM, being statistically significant in most analyses.

          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            NH intervention with emphasis on weight loss and reduction of dietary sodium is as effective as NH intervention plus pharmacological treatment in reducing echocardiographically determined LVM, despite a smaller decrease in blood pressure in the NH intervention only group. A possible exception is that the addition of diuretic (chlorthalidone) may have a modest additional effect on reducing LVM.

"At equipotent doses, isradipine is better tolerated than amlodipine in patients with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension: a double‐blind, randomized, parallel‐group study.","<jats:p>1. The objective of this double‐blind parallel‐group study was to compare the tolerability of isradipine and amlodipine, specifically, the side‐effects known to be related to the use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. 2. A total of 205 patients with mild‐to‐moderate essential hypertension were randomized to receive either the sustained‐ release (SRO) formulation of isradipine (n = 103) or amlodipine (n = 102), both at dosages of 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure measurements were taken at the end of the dosing interval to assess the antihypertensive efficacy of the two drugs. 3. Adverse reactions were assessed in two ways: a) spontaneously reported adverse events were recorded and investigated in depth for severity, duration, relation to the study drug, and outcome; b) a questionnaire was used to elicit specific adverse reactions known to be related to the use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists which were evaluated for severity, duration, relation to the study drug, and outcome. 4. After 6 weeks of active treatment, both isradipine and amlodipine reduced mean sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure: from 165.1/100.1 to 145.2/89.7 mm Hg with isradipine; and from 164.1/100.6 to 145.7/90.5 mm Hg with amlodipine. There was no difference in antihypertensive effect between isradipine and amlodipine (95% CI: ‐3.73 to 4.73 and ‐1.89 to 3.49 for differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively). 5. The number of patients spontaneously reporting adverse events was significantly higher (P = 0.02; 95% CI: 3.1 to 26.7%) with amlodipine (33.3%) than with isradipine (18.4%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</jats:p>",0

After 3‐week single blind placebo therapy, patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 94‐114 mmHg were randomized to atenolol 50 mg/day (62 patients) or diltiazem‐SR 90 mg b.i.d. (60 patients) in a double‐blind parallel study. Depending on SDBP response, the dose was increased to 100 mg/day for atenolol and 180 mg b.i.d. for diltiazem‐SR. Twenty‐four‐hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements and exercise tolerance lest by the Bruce protocol were done at the end of placebo and active treatment. Compared with placebo, both atenolol and diltiazem‐SR significantly decreased heart rate (HR), sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP), SDBP, ambulatory BP, BP load for waking and sleeping hours, area under the BP curve, rate‐pressure product (p &lt; 0.001), and exercise time (NS). Atenolol exerted a greater effect on ambulatory BP, HR, rate‐pressure product, waking diastolic BP load, and area under the 24‐h BP curve. The drugs were well tolerated and caused no serious side effects necessitating discontinuation of treatment. These findings indicate that (1) monotherapy for hypertension with atenolol or diltiazem SR is effective and well tolerated, (2) it decreases the 24‐h BP load, (3) it does not interfere with exercise capacity.</jats:p>",0

Clinical and pharmacologic study of multidrug resistance reversal with vinblastine and bepridil.,"<jats:sec><jats:title>PURPOSE</jats:title><jats:p> To achieve an adequate plasma concentration of bepridil, a calcium channel blocker, which reverts multidrug resistance (MDR) in vitro, when administered in combination with vinblastine in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, a tumor characterized by high MDR1 gene expression. To study the pharmacokinetics of both drugs, tolerability and antitumor activity in relation to the MDR1 expression in tumor tissue. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</jats:title><jats:p> Sixteen colorectal cancer patients entered the study. Bepridil was administered by central venous catheter as 5-mg/kg bolus over 30 minutes, followed by 12 mg/kg for 12 hours and 5 mg/kg for 24 hours. Vinblastine 5 mg/m2 was administered as an intravenous (i.v.) bolus 24.5 hours after the start of bepridil. MDR1/P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression was assessed in 14 tumor samples by immunohistochemistry and RNase protection assay. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title><jats:p> The bepridil plasma level was greater than 2 mumol/L at the time of vinblastine administration in all patients investigated. At the dose used in the study, bepridil produced a QTc-prolongation more than 50 ms, which prevented further dose escalation. However, cardiac toxicity was asymptomatic in all treated patients, and other side effects were mild. MDR1/Pgp expression was positive in nine of 14 cases. Of fifteen patients assessable for response, one complete remission of 8 months' duration and 14 progressions were observed. The responding patient attained complete remission again when re-treated on progression with vinblastine alone. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSION</jats:title><jats:p> Bepridil plasma concentrations needed in vitro to modulate MDR could be achieved in this study with tolerable toxicity; however, despite most tumors being MDR1/Pgp-positive, no response was obtained that could be attributed to the drug combination. Mechanisms of drug resistance other than MDR are probably implicated in drug resistance of colorectal cancer. </jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Controlled Study with a New Sustained‐Release Formulation of Nifedipine in Essential Hypertensive Patients,"<jats:p>The authors studied the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of a new sustained‐release formulation of nifedipine 50 mg once a day, in comparison with nifedipine retard 20 mg twice a day in patients with mild or moderate primary arterial hypertension. Both treatments significantly lowered blood pressure with no difference in daily blood pressure profile. At steady state, the two drugs determined comparable plasma levels of nifedipine as measured immediately before the morning dose. After a 12‐month treatment, the new formulation of nifedipine still displayed satisfactory blood pressure control in both supine and standing positions, with no change in tolerability throughout the study. In conclusion, this new sustained‐release formulation of nifedipine has similar efficacy and tolerability to conventional treatment with nifedipine retard 20 mg twice a day.</jats:p>",0

Double‐blind comparison of amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with mild to moderate hypertension,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the final analysis of this study at Week 26,26% of the patients randomized to receive amlodipine attained blood pressure control with amlodipine alone compared with 33% of the patients allocated to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Neither amlodipine nor HCTZ produced clinically significant changes in pulse rate or in the electrocardiogram. Amlodipine treatment did not appear to produce clinically significant changes in blood lipids; HCTZ, however, produced an increase in total plasma cholesterol (Δ22.9 ± 8.6 mg/dl). The incidence of side effects and the rate of patient withdrawal in the amlodipine and HCTZ groups were comparable. As expected, HCTZ therapy caused well‐recognized biochemical alterations in cholesterol and potassium levels, whereas amlodipine was metabolically neutral.</jats:p>",0

The Use of Confidence Intervals to Describe the Precision of Trough/Peak Ratios for Diltiazem CD in the Treatment of Hypertension,"<jats:p><jats:italic>Once‐daily diltiazem hydrochloride, CARDIZEM® CD (diltiazem CD) 300 mg, was evaluated for safety, efficacy, and the relationship between peak and trough antihypertensive ejects in a multicenter, placebo‐controlled, parallel design trial. After a 4‐ to 6‐week placebo baseline period, 111 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to receive placebo or diltiazem CD for a 4‐week treatment period. Diltiazem CD 300 mg lowered supine diastolic and systolic blood pressure at trough significantly more than placebo (‐7.5 mm Hg vs. −1.3 mm Hg</jats:italic>, P = <jats:italic>0.0001 and −6.4 mm Hg vs. 0.5 mm Hg</jats:italic>, P = <jats:italic>0.0051, respectively). Supine blood pressure was also measured hourly from 6 to 10 hours after the dose to assess peak effect and trough/peak ratios. Using the largest residual drug effect of−6.3 mm Hg at 6 hours as peak and the 24−hour residual drug effect of−5.9 mm Hg as trough, the trough/peak ratio was estimated to be 71%, with a lower one‐sided 95% confidence limit of 50%. The precision of the trough/peak ratio is estimated by the lower confidence limit of 50%, which establishes the trough/peak ratio as statistically ≥ 50%. No statistically significant differences in supine DBP were noted between the peak effect hours, indicating a plateau of the peak antihypertensive effect from 6 to 10 hours post‐dose. Diltiazem CD therapy was well tolerated, with no serious treatment‐related adverse events reported during the trial and no patients discontinuing the trial due to a treatment‐related adverse event. This trial demonstrates diltiazem CD 300 mg is a safe and effective therapy when administered once daily for the treatment of essential hypertension</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0

A New Preparation of Nifedipine for Sublingual Application in Hypertensive Urgencies,"<jats:p> A new preparation of nifedipine for sublingual application in hypertensive urgencies was investigated in a prospective study. Patients admitted to the Emergency Department with a persistent elevation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 190 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 100 mm Hg received nifedipine 10 mg sublin gual with a sprayer. A second dose was administrated fifteen minutes later if an adequate response defined as a stable reduction of SBP below 180 mm Hg and DBP below 100 mm Hg had not occurred. Of 30 patients, 21 (70%) responded to the first nifedipine appli cation, 7 responded to the second dose, and 2 nonresponders had to be treated with urapidil. Overall mean SBP was 206 ± 19 mm Hg and mean DBP was 113 ± 15 mm Hg before treatment, and a significant antihypertensive effect was noted within fifteen minutes after nifedipine spray (p &lt; 0.05). The maximum antihypertensive effect was for SBP in sixty minutes (146 ±19 mm Hg) and for DBP after one hundred twenty minutes (78 ± 18 mm Hg). The average reduction in SBP was 29% and in DBP 31%. In first-dose responders (n = 21) a significant antihypertensive effect was noted within fifteen minutes. SBP declined from 205 ±21 to a minimum of 142 ±15 mm Hg (22.3%) after sixty minutes and DBP from 113 ± 13 to a minimum of 77 ±11 mm Hg (22.2%) after one hundred twenty minutes. In second-dose responders (n = 7) a significant antihypertensive effect was noted within thirty minutes. SBP declined from 214 ±20 to a minimum of 151 ± 18 mm Hg (29.5%) after sixty minutes and DBP from 123 ± 14 to a minimum of 92 ±31 mm Hg (24.9%) after one hundred twenty minutes. After treatment with sublin gual nifedipine spray the authors could not observe any clinically significant side effects. Overall the heart rate decreased significantly from 100 ±21 beats per minute to a minimum of 84 ± 15 beats per minute after one hundred twenty minutes. The authors conclude that sublingual nifedipine spray application offers a new, highly effective, safe, and convenient method of treating patients with hypertensive urgencies. </jats:p>",0

Pharmacokinetics and Dynamic Response of Plain and Slow Release Isradipine Formulations in Moderately Hypertensive Patients,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> The pharmacokinetic variables and antihypertensive effect of the calcium antagonist isradipine, were investigated in 30 hypertensive patients. Isradipine was given orally in parallel group design in plain and slow release formulations in doses of 2.5 mg twice daily and 5.0 mg once daily, respectively. Isradipine concentration in serum was measured by a sensitive RIA method after the first dose and after 6 weeks of treatment. The pharmacokinetics and concentration/effect relationship after the first dose and after 6 weeks of treatment were compared. No differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between single and multiple dosing. Data were in accordance with results from studies in healthy volunteers. Rate, but not extent of bioavailability differs between the two isradipine formulations. Antihypertensive efficacy of the two formulations was similar (16/11 and 19/15 mmHg), and a significant time dependent increase in E<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> from 10/3 mmHg to 23/14 mmHg after 6 weeks of treatment was observed.</jats:p>",0

Verapamil and Nifedipine in Combination for the Treatment of Hypertension,"<jats:p>The authors examined the efficacy and safety of the combination of verapamil and nifedipine in the control of hypertension. Retrospective analysis of blood pressures was obtained on 50 patients who had historically documented essential hypertension and were receiving verapamil and nifedipine. The patients had moderate to severe hypertension; 27 of 50 (54%) were uncontrolled on prescribed regimens of two or more separate classes of drugs. Control was defined by the ability to maintain a blood pressure of ≤ 160/90 by providing doses of verapamil (max: 480 mg/day) and nifedipine (max: 180 mg/day). Twenty‐nine (50%) were black and 21 (42%) were white. Ages ranged from 16 to 84 years. Mean duration of therapy was 1–2 years. Only 3 of 50 (6%) were control failures after providing verapamil and nifedipine. Three of 50 (6%) were discontinued because of side effects — reversible hepatitis (2) and rash (1). There were no serious adverse events, i.e., CHF or arrhythmias. Manageable ankle edema was seen in 14 of 50 (28%) patients. Verapamil and nifedipine, a combination of a dihydropyridine and a non‐dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, was effective and safe in this group of patients with difficult‐to‐manage hypertension.</jats:p>",0

          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>METHODS AND RESULTS</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Patients (n = 1473) seen within 24 hours of ischemic chest discomfort at rest, considered to represent unstable angina or NQMI, were randomized using a 2 x 2 factorial design to compare (1) TPA versus placebo as initial therapy and (2) an early invasive strategy (early coronary arteriography followed by revascularization when the anatomy was suitable) versus an early conservative strategy (coronary arteriography followed by revascularization if initial medical therapy failed). All patients were treated with bed rest, anti-ischemic medications, aspirin, and heparin. The primary end point for the TPA-placebo comparison (death, myocardial infarction, or failure of initial therapy at 6 weeks) occurred in 54.2% of the TPA-treated patients and 55.5% of the placebo-treated patients (P = NS). Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction after randomization (reinfarction in NQMI patients) occurred more frequently in TPA-treated patients (7.4%) than in placebo-treated patients (4.9%, P = .04, Kaplan-Meier estimate). Four intracranial hemorrhages occurred in the TPA-treated group versus none in the placebo-treated group (P = .06). The end point for the comparison of the two strategies (death, myocardial infarction, or an unsatisfactory symptom-limited exercise stress test at 6 weeks) occurred in 18.1% of patients assigned to the early conservative strategy and 16.2% of patients assigned to the early invasive strategy (P = NS). In the latter, the average length of initial hospitalization, incidence of rehospitalization within 6 weeks, and days of rehospitalization all were significantly lower.</jats:p>

            <jats:title>CONCLUSIONS</jats:title>
            <jats:p>In the overall trial, patients with unstable angina and NQMI were managed with low rates of mortality (2.4%) and myocardial infarction or reinfarction (6.3%) at the time of the 6-week visit. These results can be achieved using either an early conservative or early invasive strategy, the latter resulting in a reduced incidence of days of hospitalization and of rehospitalization and in the use of antianginal drugs. The addition of a thrombolytic agent is not beneficial and may be harmful.</jats:p>

Clinical assessment of gingival hyperplasia in patients treated with nifedipine,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract</jats:bold> Gingival hyperplasia caused by the use of nifedipine has been extensively reported. In this paper, the gingiva of 18 patients suffering from cardiopathy and treated with nifedipine were compared with those of 10 patients with cardiac disorders who had not been treated with calcium antagonists and with a no‐treatment group of 12 patients. Nifedipine produced gingival hyperplasia although patients who had not been treated with calcium antagonists also had mild hyperplasia. Hyperplasia first appeared in the interproximal areas, an observation which may be important for early detection. There was a direct correlation between the degree of hyperplasia and the bacterial plaque score.

ACE inhibition versus calcium antagonism in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension: a multicentre study. Ireland-Netherlands Lisinopril-Nifedipine Study Group,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>
               <jats:p>The efficacy of lisinopril 10-40 mg once daily was compared with that of nifedipine tablets 20-40 mg twice daily in a multicentre double-blind randomized parallel group study of 16 weeks duration involving 127 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The groups randomized to lisinopril or to nifedipine were not significantly different with respect to any demographic variable. An analysis of the pooled data from all centres demonstrated a significantly greater fall in both lying and standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) on lisinopril than on nifedipine treatment (difference between treatments 7.70 +/- 3.34 mmHg; P = 0.02 and 10.2 +/- 3.30 mmHg; P = 0.003 for lying and standing SBP, respectively). However, this difference may be accounted for by the slightly higher mean SBP in the lisinopril treatment groups compared with the nifedipine group at the end of the placebo run-in period.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Both treatments lowered lying and standing diastolic blood pressures (DBP) to the same extent and the response rates to the two treatments were the same. The effects of the two drugs on heart rate were indistinguishable from each other.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>There were six lisinopril and 12 nifedipine-treated patients withdrawn during randomized treatment (P = 0.22). Nineteen per cent of lisinopril patients reported an adverse event compared with 36% of nifedipine patients. The relative risk of an adverse event on lisinopril compared with nifedipine was 0.42 (confidence limits 1.027-0.172) a difference which approached statistical significance (P = 0.0573).</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Lisinopril produced a greater reduction in both lying and standing SBP than nifedipine and both were associated with equivalent reductions in DBP. Lisinopril may be better tolerate than nifedipine.</jats:p>",0

Antianginal and Antiischemic Efficacy of Monotherapy Extended‐Release Nisoldipine (Coat Core) in Chronic Stable Angina,"<jats:p>A double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled study was conducted to test the peak and trough antianginal and antiischemic monotherapy efficacy and safety of a new extended‐release formulation of nisoldipine (nisoldipine Coat Core [Bayer Corporation], 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg once daily compared to placebo). Study patients had a history of chronic, stable angina pectoris, exercise‐induced angina in association with ST segment depression, and exercise test reproducibility. Of the 483 patients enrolled in the study, results were valid for safety analysis for 312 and for efficacy analysis for 284. There was a statistically significant improvement in total exercise time at both peak and trough for patients taking 20 mg and 60 mg of nisoldipine compared with patients taking placebo, but the group taking 60 mg was not better than the group taking 20 mg (33.9 and 33.7 seconds, respectively, at trough). The results were similar for the secondary endpoints (time to onset of angina and time to 1 mm ST segment depression). No correlation was evident between plasma nisoldipine levels and total exercise duration. Headache and peripheral edema were the most frequently reported adverse events and were dose related. There were no discontinuations due to adverse events in patients randomized to the 20‐mg nisoldipine group. No deaths occurred while patients were receiving active nisoldipine therapy. Therapy with this extended‐release formulation of nisoldipine is an effective once‐daily treatment for chronic stable angina pectoris. It represents one of the few dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists that has shown efficacy when administered as monotherapy to patients with angina.</jats:p>",0
Moexipril in the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Essential Hypertension: Comparison with Sustained‐Release Verapamil,"<jats:p>To compare and contrast the antihypertensive efficacy of an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to a calcium antagonist, 88 and 90 patients with essential hypertension were randomly assigned to receive moexipril and verapamil, respectively. At the end of the first 6 weeks of active therapy, sitting diastolic blood pressure decreased by 11 mmHg in patients receiving moexipril and by 9 mmHg in patients receiving verapamil. The 24‐week treatment period was completed by 72 patients who received moexipril and 71 patients who received verapamil. Mean decreases in sitting diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg and 11 mmHg were observed in the respective intent‐to‐treat moexipril and verapamil groups. At doses of 7.5 mg and 15 mg once daily, moexipril had an antihypertensive effect comparable to that of sustained‐release verapamil at doses of 180 mg and 240 mg once daily.</jats:p>",0

"<b>Proarrhythmia with Class III Antiarrhythmic Drugs</b>: Definition, Electrophysiologic Mechanisms, Incidence, Predisposing Factors, and Clinical Implications","<jats:p>Proarrhythmia with Class III Antiarrhythmic Agents. Antiarrhythmic drugs can and do induce unexpected and sometimes fatal reactions by either producing new symptomatic arrhythmias or by aggravating existing arrhythmias. The definition of proarrhythmia has changed since controlled clinical studies showed a dichotomy between arrhythmia suppression and mortality. The nature of proarrhythmia reactions is linked to the electrophysiologic effects of various antiarrhythmic drugs. Whereas Class I agents without accompanying effects on repolarization generally produce ventricular tachycardia (often incessant) or fibrillation. Class III agents typically produce torsades de pointes that may deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation. The precise mechanism of torsades de pointes is not fully elucidated, although early afterdepolarization and increases in spatial or temporal dispersion of repolarization are likely possibilities. Proarrhythmic risk is lowest for amiodarone and is probably related to the drug's complex electrophysiologic profile. The incidence of torsades with sotalol increases with dose and the baseline values of the QT interval; the incidence with d‐sotalol and other pure Class III agents remains unclear. Prospective, randomized, placebo‐controlled studies to evaluate this are under way. The fact that d‐sotalol increases mortality in postinfarction patients suggests that it may possibly be a common property of most, if not all, pure Class III compounds. The ongoing clinical trials with various Class III agents are likely to provide the critical information on this important therapeutic issue.</jats:p>",0

Effects of gemfibrozil (Lopid) on hyperlipidemia in acitretin-treated patients. Results of a double-blind cross-over study.,"<jats:p>Hyperlipidemia is a common side-effect of oral retinoid treatment, which sometimes interferes with long-term therapy. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the lipid-lowering drug gemfibrozil on retinoid-associated hyperlipidemia, we studied the clinical response and the plasma lipoprotein levels in 22 acitretin-treated (0.25-0.75 mg/kg) patients mainly suffering from psoriasis. Gemfibrozil or placebo was given in a double-blind cross-over fashion to 14 patients, who after 8 weeks of acitretin therapy and dietary advice exhibited hyperlipidemia (triglyceride levels &gt; or = 50% above baseline and/or &gt; or = 2.0 mmol/l). Serum triglycerides remained high (3.7 +/- 2.4 mmol/l) during placebo treatment but were reduced after 8 weeks of gemfibrozil treatment (p &lt; 0.01). The total cholesterol level decreased slightly (p &lt; 0.05) during gemfibrozil treatment, but the LDL/HDL ratio did not change significantly. No untoward effects of gemfibrozil on acitretin dose-response and clinical side-effects were noted. Gemfibrozil thus appears useful in patients prone to retinoid-induced hyperlipidemia unresponsive to dietary treatment and acitretin dose reductions.</jats:p>",0

"Comparison of Amlodipine and Benazepril Monotherapy to Amlodipine Plus Benazepril In Patients with Systemic Hypertension: A Randomized, Double‐Blind, Placebo‐Controlled, Parallel‐Group Study","<jats:p>A single‐blind, run‐in, randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group, placebo‐controlled comparison trial was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of low‐dose amlodipine 2.5 mg daily, low‐dose benazepril 10 mg daily, and the combination of the two drugs at the same doses used once daily in patients (n = 401) with mild to moderate (stages I and II) systemic hypertension. Both monotherapy regimens were shown to significantly reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with baseline placebo values, and the combination regimen was shown to be superior in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with either of the monotherapy regimens. The combination therapy also resulted in a greater percentage of patients having successful clinical response in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure. The amlodipine and benazepril regimen was also shown to be associated with a similar incidence of adverse experiences as the active monotherapy or placebo regimens, although the group given combination therapy appeared to have a lower incidence of edema than the group given amlodipine alone. Low‐dose amlodipine (2.5 mg) plus benazepril (10 mg) provides greater blood‐pressure‐lowering efficacy than either monotherapy, and has an excellent safety profile.</jats:p>",0

Stress‐induced hemodynamic and hemostatic changes in patients with systemic hypertension: Effect of verapamil,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Stress‐induced hemodynamic and hemostatic responses may acutely trigger atherosclerotic plaque disruption and thrombosis leading to myocardial infarction. This study was designed to evaluate the responses to three stressors and to determine if once‐daily sustained release verapamil (Verelan®) modified these responses. We studied 13 patients with mild to moderate hypertension in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover trial. After 4 weeks of therapy, patients were evaluated following assumption of the upright posture, mental stress, and cold pressor test. During placebo, the stressors produced an increase in systolic pressure (144 ± 2 to 167 ± 3 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001), heart rate (70 ± 2 to 77 ± 2 beats/ min, p&lt; 0.001), and platelet aggregability to adenosine diphosphate (threshold concentration fell from 2.8 ± 0.4 to 1.9 ± 0.1 μM, p = 0.05)and epinephrine (3.4±0.9 to 1.6 ±0.6 μM, p &lt; 0.001). Verapamil lowered systolic pressure at baseline (144 ± 2 to 134 ± 2 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001), and after stress (167 ± 3 to 154 &lt; 3 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001), but did not alter the absolute increase with stress. During verapamil, platelet reactivity did not increase with stress, and the post‐stress response to epinephrine was reduced (higher threshold concentration) compared with placebo (3.9 ± 1.3 vs. 1.5 ± 0.3 μM, p = 0.05). Verapamil also reduced the response to collagen (increased lag time) at baseline and after stress (111 ± 9 vs. 91 ± 3 s, p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that verapamil blunted potentially harmful stress‐induced hemodynamic and hemostatic changes. Further studies are required to determine whether these effects translate into a lower incidence of acute cardiovascular events.</jats:p>",0
Comparison of Nifedipine Alone and With Diltiazem or Verapamil in Hypertension,"<jats:p>
            Receptor binding studies suggest that combinations of calcium channel blockers may result in either enhanced or diminished pharmacological effects, but clinical data in hypertension are incomplete. In this study, we compared blood pressure reductions using nifedipine alone, nifedipine plus diltiazem, and nifedipine plus verapamil and determined whether combinations alter nifedipine pharmacokinetics. After determination of baseline blood pressures, 16 subjects with essential hypertension (12 men, 4 women; mean age, 48 years) received 30 mg/d open-label, sustained release nifedipine for 2 weeks. If still hypertensive (n=16), they were randomized (double-blind) to receive either additional sustained release diltiazem or sustained release verapamil, both 180 mg/d, for 2 weeks and were then crossed-over for the final 2 weeks of the study. All medications were once-daily, extended-release formulations. Blood pressures and nifedipine plasma concentrations were measured during the final day of each treatment. Overall, each combination lowered mean systolic and diastolic pressures more than nifedipine alone. Mean supine diastolic pressures were significantly lower at 8 hours (77.6 versus 84.6 mm Hg,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.001) and 12 hours (81.5 versus 87.1 mm Hg,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.04) with nifedipine plus diltiazem than nifedipine plus verapamil. Mean nifedipine concentrations were inversely correlated with mean blood pressures. Mean nifedipine area under the curve values were greater with diltiazem than verapamil (1430 versus 1134 ng·h/mL,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.026), with each greater than nifedipine alone (957 ng·h/mL). Nifedipine plus diltiazem had a greater antihypertensive effect than nifedipine plus verapamil. Diltiazem caused greater increases in nifedipine plasma concentrations than did verapamil. These data suggest that combined calcium channel blockers result in additive antihypertensive effects, perhaps because of a pharmacokinetic interaction.

Effects of Dihydropyridine Calcium Antagonists on Albuminuria in Patients with Diabetes,"<jats:p>The present study was designed to assess the effects of two different dyhydropyridine calcium antagonists (DHPCAs) on proteinuria in patients with noninsulin‐dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The hypothesis that similar levels of blood pressure reduction with two different DHPCAs produce similar degrees of proteinuria reduction was tested. In a prospective randomized study, 14 patients with NIDDM, hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency were given either isradipine (n = 7) or nifedipine XL (n = 7) for 6 months. After a 2‐week washout period, patients were crossed over to the other drug and observed for an additional 6 months. Drugs were titrated to lower arterial pressure to &lt;140/90 mmHg. Patients also instructed to follow a low‐sodium diet at the initial visit. Blood pressure and 24‐hour urine values for creatinine clearance, albuminuria, proteinuria, and sodium were assessed monthly. At the end of the initial and crossover treatment periods, there were no significant reductions in the level of albuminuria from baseline with either drug. Sodium excretion was &lt;110 mEq/L with each drug tested. The results of this study support the concept that DHPCAs do not reduce proteinuria in patients with type II diabetes. This failure to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria occurred despite adequate blood pressure reduction and an effort at dietary sodium restriction.</jats:p>",0

An open crossover study was performed comprising 16 non-diabetic hypertensive women (age range 59–75 years). The women continued to take a beta-blocker as a basal therapy. Each treatment period lasted three months. The blood pressure was similar irrespective of treatment. Blood glucose values were not significantly different during the oral glucose tolerance test. Serum insulin levels after glucose administration were lower when the patients were treated with felodipine than when taking hydrochlorothiazide. A possible explanation for this observation may be an increased insulin release as a consequence of treatment with a diuretic in order to maintain normal blood glucose levels during the glucose tolerance test. Felodipine appears preferable to hydrochlorothiazide as an addition to a beta blocker in hypertensive patients from a glucose metabolism point of view. </jats:p>",0

Data were obtained for SVT patients treated in a metropolitan, fire‐department‐based paramedic system serving a population of approximately 1 million persons. Standard drug protocols were used and patient outcomes (i.e., conversion rates, complications, and recurrences) were monitored.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> During the adenosine treatment period, 105 patients had SVT; 87 (83%) received adenosine, of whom 60(69%) converted to a sinus rhythm (SR). Vagal maneuvers (VM) resulted in restoration of SR in 8 patients (7.6%). Some patients received adenosine for non‐SVT rhythms: 7 sinus tachycardia, 18 atrial fibrillation, 7 wide‐complex tachycardia (WCT), and 2 ventricular tachycardia; no non‐SVT rhythm converted to SR and none of these patients experienced an adverse effect. Twenty‐five patients were hemodynamically unstable (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg), with 20 receiving drug and 13 converting to SR; 8 patients required electrical cardioversion. Four patients experienced adverse effects related to adenosine (chest pain, dyspnea, prolonged bradycardia, and ventricular tachycardia). In the verapamil period, 106 patients had SVT; 52 (49%) received verapamil (p &lt; 0.001, compared with the adenosine period), of whom 43 (88%) converted to SR (p = 0.11). Two patients received verapamil for WCT; neither converted to SR and both experienced cardiovascular collapse. VM resulted in restoration of SR in 12 patients (11.0%) (p = 0.52). Sixteen patients were hemodynamically unstable, with 5 receiving drug (p = 0.005) and 5 converting to SR; 9 patients required electrical cardioversion (p = 0.48). Four patients experienced adverse effects related to verapamil (hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation). Recurrence of SVT was noted in 2 adenosine patients and 2 verapamil patients in the out‐of‐hospital setting and in 23 adenosine patients and 15 verapamil patients after ED arrival, necessitating additional therapy (p = 0.48 and 0.88, for recurrence rates and types of additional merapies, respectively). Hospital diagnoses, outcomes, and ED dispositions were similar for the 2 groups.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Adenosine and verapamil were equally successful in converting out‐of‐hospital SVT in patients with similar etiologies responsible for the SVT. Recurrence of SVT occurred at similar rates for the 2 medications. Rhythm misidentification remains a common issue in out‐of‐hospital cardiac care in this emergency medical services system.</jats:p>",0

Diltiazem Improves Cardiac Function and Exercise Capacity in Patients With Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Background</jats:italic>
            Evidence is arising that calcium antagonists in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) may have beneficial effects on virus-induced cardiopathology, alcohol toxicity, microcirculatory disorders, and impaired calcium cycling, all possibly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, the effect of adjunct diltiazem (60 to 90 mg TID) on standard treatment was investigated.

            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            The Diltiazem in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DiDi) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of 186 patients (92 receiving diltiazem, 94 receiving placebo) with IDC diagnosed by coronary angiography, catheterization of the left side of the heart, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;0.50 (mean, 0.34±0.11). The effect of adjunct diltiazem treatment on transplant listing–free survival, hemodynamics, exercise capacity, and subjective status was investigated. During the 24-month study period, 33 patients dropped out of the study; 153 patients finished the study protocol. Twenty-seven patients died or had a listing for heart transplantation: 16 in the placebo group and 11 in the diltiazem group. The transplant listing–free survival rate was 85% for diltiazem and 80% for placebo recipients (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.001). Diltiazem also increased exercise capacity (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.002) and subjective well-being (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.01). Adverse reactions were minor and evenly distributed in both groups, except for an increase in the PQ interval in the diltiazem group.

          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            In patients with IDC, the adjunct therapy of diltiazem improves cardiac function, exercise capacity, and subjective status without deleterious effects on transplant listing–free survival.

After a single blind placebo run‐in period, hypertensive patients were randomized to amlodipine 5 mg once daily or diltiazem 90 mg twice daily. After 4–6 weeks, doses were increased to 10 mg once daily or 180 mg twice daily, if necessary for control of diastolic blood pressure. During week 9 or 10 on active treatment blisterpacks contained 2 days of placebo.

Evaluation of gingival and periodontal conditions following causal periodontal treatment in patients treated with nifedipine and diltiazem<sup>*</sup>,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract</jats:bold> It is established that phenytoin, cyclosporin and some calcium antagonists produce gingival overgrowth, but it is not known how this condition may respond to causal periodontal treatment. In order to find out, a longitudinal study was carried out, over a year, comparing a group of patients who were given nifedipine (NG, n= 18) and another group who were given diltiazem (DG. <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 13) with 2 others: one comprised cardiopathic patients who took no calcium antagonists (CG, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 12) and the other contained patients who were medically healthy. with moderate periodontitis (HG, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 12). On their basal visit, they were examined and instructed in oral hygiene, and then given causal periodontal treatment, being seen again at 4 and 8 months, when hygiene instructions were reinforced. They were seen for the last time at 12 months, when they were again examined. Groups NG and DG, on their basal visit, showed larger gum size than groups HG and CG. which was statistically significant; on their final visit, these differences remained only at the interproximal level. The number of patients with gingival overgrowth‐taking the average of group HG as a minimal value‐was much higher in groups CG (92%). DG (100%) and NG (89%) on the basal visit; on the final visit, the differences remained only in groups DG (85%) and NG (83%). The probing pocket depth reduction was much greater in groups HG and CG than in DG and NG. basically due to a greater gaining on clinical attachment level. The % of sites in which the pocket depth improved by more than 2 mm was 39.8% in HG, 54.5% in CG, 23.7% in DG and 28.7% in NG. The % of sites where the attachment gain by more than 2 mm was 46.2% in HG, 55.5% in CG, 22.8% in DG and 21.4% in NG. The amount of plaque and bleeding on probing, which was similar in all groups on the basal visit, decreased throughout the study, especially between the basal and 2nd visit in groups HG and CG. We have demonstrated that patients that take nifedipine and diltiazem show a larger gum size and their response to causal periodontal treatment is poorer than in the healthy and the cardiac groups.</jats:p>",0

Review : Ultraviolet-A1 (340-400 nm) irradiation therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus,"<jats:p> Ultraviolet-A1 (UV-A1) wavelengths have been found effective in mitigating signs and symp toms of disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but studies have been uncon trolled. To rigorously assess the effectiveness and safety of daily low-dose UV-A1 irradiation as a therapeutic agent in this disorder we enrolled 26 women with SLE in an 18-week two-phase study. During the initial six-week prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, the patients were divided into two groups; Group A was exposed to 60 kJ/m <jats:sup>2</jats:sup> of UV-A1 (340-400 nm) irradiation within a sunbed five days a week for three weeks and Group B was exposed for an equal amount of time to visible light of greater than &gt; 430 nm (placebo). Each group was then crossed over for exposure to the other source for three weeks. During the second phase - 12 weeks - patients and physicians were unblinded and patients were irradiated with progressively decreasing levels of UV-A1 only. </jats:p><jats:p> Twenty-five patients completed the six-week placebo-controlled phase of the study and eighteen patients participated for the entire 18 weeks. In Group A the systemic lupus activ ity measure (SLAM) score improved significantly after three weeks of five-day-a-week UV-A1 irradiation (P &lt; 0.05), regressing to baseline during the three weeks of placebo irra diation. Improvement recurred and progressed with six weeks of three-day-a-week UV-A1 irradiation (P &lt; 0.05). Group B patients responded negligibly to the three weeks of visible light, more sharply to UV-A1, and as with Group A, maximally to the six weeks of three- day-a-week UV-A1 (P &lt; 0.01). With twice- and then once-weekly UV-A1 irradiation the SLAM scores worsened slightly. </jats:p><jats:p> All patients decreased their drug use. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti- dsDNA) decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) and anti-nuclear antibodies non-significantly. Side effects were negligible. Visible light had no significant effect. In conclusion, low-dose UV-A1 irradiation effectively, comfortably, and without apparent toxicity diminished signs and symptoms of disease activity in SLE. </jats:p>",0
A Comparison of the Antihypertensive Effectiveness of a Combination of Moexipril or Sustained‐Release Verapamil with Low‐Dose Hydrochlorothiazide,"<jats:p>The antihypertensive effectiveness of moexipril, a new angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and sustained‐release verapamil (verapamil SR) in combination with low‐dose hydrochlorothiazide was investigated in patients with moderate to severe (Stages II and III) essential hypertension. Of 147 patients treated for 4 weeks with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day, 108 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 100 to 114 mmHg were randomly assigned to receive either moexipril 7.5 mg/day (n = 56) or verapamil SR 180 mg/day (n = 52) in addition to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day. After 4 weeks of treatment, doses of moexipril or verapamil SR were increased to 15 and 240 mg/day respectively for patients with SDBP of ≥90 mmHg. These patients were evaluated for an additional 8 weeks. Electrocardiograms, blood chemistries, blood counts, urinalysis, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone levels were monitored during the study. Moexipril or verapamil SR, in combination with low dose hydrochlorothiazide, resulted in decreased blood pressure in the sitting and standing positions. No correlation between blood pressure response and baseline plasma renin activity was demonstrated. The results of this study indicate that both moexipril and verapamil SR produced an additive hypertensive effect when added to low‐dose hydrochlorothiazide. These combinations were well tolerated by the patients and did not result in serious clinical and metabolic side effects.</jats:p>",0

Chronopharmacologic Considerations When Treating the Patient with Hypertension: A Review,<jats:p>Recognition of the existence of circadian variation in exacerbation of cardiovascular disease may have relevance to clinical use of cardioactive agents. Physiologic rational for the chronobiology of cardiac disease exists and can provide a basis on which to examine the efficacy of agents to manage cardiac disease. The use of 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) devices have advanced our ability to describe the interplay of chronobiologic rhythms and pharmacodynamic response to antihypertensive medications. This review summarizes the studies evaluating the use of various antihypertensive medications in the context of using 24‐hour blood pressure monitoring devices. The studies are described in an attempt to increase awareness of chronobiology and potential implications of designing chronotherapeutic regimens.</jats:p>,0

Prescribing Practices for the Management of Headache in Newfoundland and Labrador,"<jats:p>To assess the impact of sumatriptan in clinical practice, we undertook a retrospective analysis of the government of Newfoundland and Labrador's prescription drug program data base for 35 consecutive patients prescribed sumatriptan. The number of doses of all drugs prescribed ranged from 121 to 18874 on from 4 to 357 prescriptions per patient over 1 to 19 months. The mean number of doses of analgesic drugs prescribed before sumatriptan therapy was 56 per month and after initiation of sumatriptan was 46 per month. The prescribing of multiple analgesics was common; 79% received three or more different analgesics. Twenty‐two (63%) patients were prescribed medications indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine concomitantly with drugs indicated for symptomatic treatment. Twenty‐four (69%) patients were prescribed medication capable of inducing migraine. We conclude that sumatriptan did not have a major impact on the outcomes of these patients judged by their use of analgesics. The simplest explanation is that many of the patients were suffering from analgesic‐induced headache rather than migraine. In addition, we conclude that there were deficiencies in prescribing practices including numbers, quantities, and choice of analgesics; the use of analgesics concomitantly with drugs indicated for migraine prophylaxis; and the use of drugs capable of inducing migraine. Further research is required to validate these findings.</jats:p>",0

The Effect of Verapamil on the Prevalence and Severity of Cyclosporine‐Induced Gingival Overgrowth in Renal Allograft Recipients,"<jats:p>C<jats:sc>yclosporine</jats:sc> A (C<jats:sc>s</jats:sc>A) <jats:sc>and verapamil</jats:sc> are two agents used in renal transplantation, both of which are suspected of inducing gingival overgrowth. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of verapamil on the severity and prevalence of CsA‐induced gingival overgrowth. Fifty‐one (51) renal transplant recipients (total group) of whom 22 were using only CsA (Group A) and 29 of whom were prescribed CsA + verapamil (Group B) were evaluated for various periodontal and pharmacological parameters. No statistically significant differences were found in age, sex, plaque index, gingival index, calculus index, probing depth, CsA oral dose, CsA whole blood level, duration of CsA therapy, azathioprine dose, and prednisolone dose. Although the prevalence of the gingival overgrowth was more pronounced in CsA + verapamil group compared to CsA group (51.72% vs. 40.91%), the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the severity of gingival overgrowth, although more manifest in CsA + Verapamil group than CsA patients (34.24% vs. 28.91%), was not significantly different. Gingival overgrowth scores in the main group, CsA, and CsA + verapamil groups were found to be positively correlated to periodontal probing depths (r = 0.60, r = 0.70, r = 0.52, respectively) and the gingival index (r = 0.60, r = 0.70, r = 0.54, respectively). CsA oral dose, whole blood level, and duration of CsA therapy were not found to be correlated with the gingival overgrowth in either group. Likewise, the dose of verapamil and the duration of verapamil therapy were not correlated with the gingival overgrowth in Group B. This study indicates that verapamil, when prescribed as the calcium channel blocker in renal transplant patients, has no augmenting effect on the severity and the prevalence of CsA‐induced gingival overgrowth. <jats:italic>J Periodontol 1996;67:1201–1205</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0

Long-term Effects on Sexual Function of Five Antihypertensive Drugs and Nutritional Hygienic Treatment in Hypertensive Men and Women,"<jats:p>
            Problems with sexual function have been a long-standing concern in the treatment of hypertension and may influence the choice of treatment regimens and decisions to discontinue drugs. The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) provides an excellent opportunity for examination of sexual function and effects of treatment on sexual function in men and women with stage I diastolic hypertension because of the number of drug classes studied, the double-blind study design, and the long-term follow-up. TOMHS was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 902 hypertensive individuals (557 men, 345 women), aged 45 to 69 years, treated with placebo or one of five active drugs (acebutolol, amlodipine maleate, chlorthalidone, doxazosin maleate, or enalapril maleate). All participants received intensive lifestyle counseling regarding weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, alcohol reduction (for current drinkers), and increased physical activity. Sexual function was ascertained by physician interviews at baseline and annually during follow-up. At baseline, 14.4% of men and 4.9% of women reported problems with sexual function. In men, 12.2% had problems obtaining and/or maintaining an erection; 2.0% of women reported a problem having an orgasm. Erection problems in men at baseline were positively related to age, systolic pressure, and previous antihypertensive drug use. The incidences of erection dysfunction during follow-up in men were 9.5% and 14.7% through 24 and 48 months, respectively, and were related to type of antihypertensive therapy. Participants randomized to chlorthalidone reported a significantly higher incidence of erection problems through 24 months than participants randomized to placebo (17.1% versus 8.1%,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.025). Incidence rates through 48 months were more similar among treatment groups than at 24 months, with nonsignificant differences between the chlorthalidone and placebo groups. Incidence was lowest in the doxazosin group but was not significantly different from the placebo group. Incidence for acebutolol, amlodipine, and enalapril groups was similar to that in the placebo group. In many cases, erection dysfunction did not require withdrawal of medication. Disappearance of erection problems among men with problems at baseline was common in all groups but greatest in the doxazosin group. Incidence of reported sexual problems in women was low in all treatment groups. In conclusion, long-term incidence of erection problems in treated hypertensive men is relatively low but is higher with chlorthalidone treatment. Effects of erection dysfunction with chlorthalidone appear relatively early and are often tolerable, and new occurrences after 2 years are unlikely. The  rate of reported sexual problems in hypertensive women is low and does not appear to differ by type of drug. Similar incidence rates of erection dysfunction in placebo and most active drug groups caution against routine attribution of erection problems to antihypertensive medication.

Effect of Calcium Channel or β-Blockade on the Progression of Diabetic Nephropathy in African Americans,"<jats:p>
            β-Blockers are known to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy by lowering arterial pressure. Moreover, in individuals with diabetic nephropathy, antihypertensive agents that provide sustained reductions in proteinuria slow the rate of decline in renal function compared with agents without this antiproteinuric effect. To examine whether differential effects on proteinuria affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy, we conducted a randomized study that compared the effects of a heart rate–lowering calcium channel blocker, sustained-release verapamil, with those of a β-blocker, atenolol, on the progression of diabetic renal disease. The primary end point of the study was a change in creatinine clearance slope. Thirty-four African Americans with the following inclusion criteria were randomized to one of the two groups: serum creatinine greater than 1.4 mg/dL, proteinuria greater than 1500 mg/d, longer than a 5-year history of both non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and exclusion of other renal diseases. Goal blood pressure was less than 140/90 mm Hg. All subjects received loop diuretics as second line agents to help achieve the blood pressure goal. Twenty-four-hour urinary protein and sodium excretions as well as creatinine clearance were measured at 6-month intervals. Blood pressure was measured every 3 months. After a mean follow-up of 54±6 months, the calcium channel blocker group demonstrated both a slower rate of decline in creatinine clearance (−1.7±0.9 versus −3.7±1.4 mL/min per year per 1.73 m

            &lt;.01) and a greater reduction in proteinuria compared with the atenolol group. Additionally, a greater proportion of the atenolol group had a 50% or more increase in serum creatinine compared with the verapamil group (32±9% versus 16±7%,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05). These between-group differences could not be explained by differences in blood pressure control. These data support the concept that antihypertensive agents that persistently maintain reductions in both arterial pressure and proteinuria slow the progression of diabetic renal disease in African Americans to a greater extent than those agents without these effects.

Calcium Channel Blockers Blunt Postural Cutaneous Vasoconstriction in Hypertensive Patients,"<jats:p>
            The aim of this work was to test whether calcium channel blockers interfere with skin vasoconstrictor reflexes that minimize postural increases in capillary pressure and avoid fluid extravasation and eventually subcutaneous edema. Studies were conducted in 23 untreated mild to moderate essential hypertensives; drugs, either calcium channel blockers or not, were given for 2 weeks according to a crossover, sequence-randomized design. Skin blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry in two skin areas: (1) the dorsum of the foot, where arteriovenous anastomoses are poorly represented, and (2) the plantar surface of the great toe, where those anastomoses are predominant. Determinations were obtained both with the foot at heart level and with it placed passively 50 cm below the heart level; percent flow changes from the horizontal to the dependent position were the measure of postural vasoconstriction. Two dihydropyridine derivatives, amlodipine (10 mg UID) and nifedipine (60 mg UID), and verapamil (240 mg BID), a chemically unrelated compound, diminished to similar extents the postural fall in skin blood flow at the dorsum of the foot. Blockade of α
            <jats:sub>1</jats:sub>
            -adrenergic and AT-1 subtype angiotensin II receptors by doxazosin (4 mg UID) and losartan (50 mg UID), respectively, exerted no effect. Postural skin blood flow responses at the plantar surface of the great toe were unmodified during the pharmacological trials. Thus, calcium channel blockers of different chemical origins antagonized postural skin vasoconstriction at the dorsum of the foot. The data indicate altered postural capillary blood flow regulation, since arteriovenous anastomoses are anatomically absent at this site; the effect was independent of either α
            <jats:sub>1</jats:sub>
            -adrenoceptor or angiotensin II receptor antagonism. Interference with skin postural vasoconstrictor mechanisms may result in net filtration of fluid to the extravascular compartment. This mechanism might explain the as yet unknown pathogenesis of ankle edema during treatment with calcium antagonists.

            The Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot study randomized 558 such patients who had coronary anatomy suitable for revascularization to three treatment strategies: angina-guided drug therapy (n=183), angina plus ischemia–guided drug therapy (n=183), or revascularization by angioplasty or bypass surgery (n=192). Two years after randomization, the total mortality was 6.6% in the angina-guided strategy, 4.4% in the ischemia-guided strategy, and 1.1% in the revascularization strategy (

The SIR of colon cancer, a site of a priori interest, was 0.8 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.1) on the basis of 34 cases. Although the results are reassuring, the lack of association could reflect the relatively short follow-up after registration in the prescription database. Continued monitoring of cancer risk is planned.

            The administration of calcium antagonists to patients with healed myocardial infarction is a controversial treatment. This study was conducted to elucidate the effect of short-acting nifedipine and diltiazem on cardiac events in patients with healed myocardial infarction.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            A controlled clinical open trial of 1115 patients with healed myocardial infarction was carried out between 1986 and 1994. The patients included 595 who received no calcium antagonist, 341 who received short-acting nifedipine 30 mg/d, and 179 who received short-acting diltiazem 90 mg/d. The primary end points were cardiac events, which were defined as fatal or nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction; death from congestive heart failure; sudden death; and hospitalization because of worsening angina, congestive heart failure, or premature ventricular contractions. Cardiac events occurred in 51 patients (8.6%) in the no-calcium-antagonist group and 54 (10.4%) in the calcium-antagonist group (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.85), demonstrating that the calcium antagonists did not reduce the incidence of cardiac events. Subgroup analysis revealed no beneficial effects of these drugs for reducing cardiac events in patients with such complications as hypertension or angina pectoris.

          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            In the Angina Prognosis Study In Stockholm (APSIS), patients with stable angina pectoris were studied prospectively during double-blind treatment with metoprolol or verapamil. Various measures of fibrinolytic function were studied in 631 (of 809) patients. During a median follow-up time of 3.2 years (2132 patient-years), 32 patients suffered a CV death, 21 had a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and 77 underwent revascularization. Plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) activity and antigen (ag), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity at rest, and TPA responses to exercise were determined at baseline and after 1 month's treatment and were related to subsequent fatal and nonfatal CV events. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that elevated levels of TPA-ag at rest (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05), high PAI-1 activity (

            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.05) were associated with increased risk of subsequent CV death. After adjustment for baseline risk factors, TPA-ag independently predicted CV death or MI. In addition, PAI-1 activity independently predicted CV death or MI in male patients. Verapamil treatment was associated with a 10% decrease of TPA-ag levels and metoprolol treatment with a 2% increase (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.001 for treatment difference).

            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            Plasma TPA-ag levels at rest, and among male patients PAI-1 activity as well, independently predict subsequent CV death or MI in patients with stable angina pectoris. Impaired fibrinolytic reactivity to exercise is a novel factor related to CV prognosis. Effects of verapamil or metoprolol treatment on fibrinolytic function did not importantly influence CV prognosis.

Seventy concentration peaks (31 with the brand‐name drug, 39 with the generic drug) appeared between 8 and 24 hours. Median percentages of increase of these peaks, compared with those of previous concentrations, were 48.3% and 36.3% for brand‐name and generic drugs, respectively. Fifty of the 70 peaks (71%) were associated with a stereospecific concentration peak of norverapamil and, temporally, with meals. Our findings suggest that whereas the two verapamil products may not be bioequivalent by Food and Drug Administration criteria, the observed differences in effects were not clinically significant in this elderly population. Multiple concentration peaks after absorption were observed in all patients with both verapamil products and were perhaps related to enterohepatic recirculation.</jats:p>",0

A statistically significant difference (p = 0.020) was shown only in the last 4-hour systolic blood pressure. However, this difference was small (122 ± 15 mm Hg with GITS vs. 126 ± 14 mm Hg with CC). There was no difference in the percentage of readings exceeding 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic. Neither dosage nor treatment order had an effect on the results. Adverse effects were reported with a greater frequency during CC therapy (40 with CC vs. 22 with GITS; p = 0.006), but were generally transient. Discontinuation of the drug was necessary in 3 patients during the CC cycle. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:title><jats:p> GITS and CC demonstrated clinically equivalent antihypertensive efficacy in the study population. The CC product may have a higher rate of adverse effects, but drug discontinuation was uncommon. Patients who are taking the GITS formulation of nifedipine as a sole antihypertensive agent can safely be switched to the CC preparation without a clinically important sacrifice in blood pressure control or a major increase in adverse effects that might lead to drug discontinuation. The results of this study cannot be extrapolated to patients with poorly controlled hypertension or with other conditions treated with nifedipine. At our military medical center or any cost-controlled institution, the reason to contemplate such a switch is clearly economic. We estimate that there are 600 patients at our institution receiving the GITS preparation, at an annual cost of $320 000. At the current market costs, a direct switch would lead to an annual savings of $120 000 for our institution. For patients currently taking the GITS nifedipine product, CC nifedipine offers adequate blood pressure control and is more cost effective. </jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Safety of Nifedipine in Patients With Hypertension,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic>
            Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with mild or moderate hypertension who received nifedipine with active drug controls. We performed a MEDLARS search using the MeSH heading “hypertension” and the text word “nifedipine” to identify all articles that were published between 1966 and August 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages and that involved human subjects. The computerized search was supplemented by a manual search of article bibliographies. Review of 1880 citations revealed 98 randomized controlled clinical trials that met protocol criteria. Articles were extracted independently by two doctors who were blinded for author, institution, and treatment regimen, using a structured, pretested extraction form. Differences of opinion were resolved by consensus. Fourteen events occurred in 5198 exposures (0.27%) to nifedipine and 24 events in 5402 exposures (0.44%) to other active drug controls. Unadjusted odds ratios for nifedipine versus controls were 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-1.09) for definitive events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, revascularization procedure) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.31-1.17) for all events (definitive plus increased angina). The odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy (sustained- or extended-release in 91% of exposures) was nonsignificantly higher for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.49-4.03 and odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.59-3.32, respectively). The odds ratio for nifedipine in combination with another drug was significantly lower for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.66 and odds ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.65, respectively). Differences in odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy and combined therapy were statistically significant (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.02 for definitive events and
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.001 for all events). Results support the safety of sustained- and extended-release nifedipine in the treatment of mild or moderate hypertension when it is used in combination with other drugs.

"Regression of Nifedipine‐Induced Gingival Hyperplasia Following Switch to a Same Class Calcium Channel Blocker, Isradipine","<jats:p>P<jats:sc>atients with nifedipine‐induced</jats:sc> gingival hyperplasia (GH) often require continued calcium channel blocker therapy. Switches to diltiazem and Verapamil have been described; however, these drugs are of a different chemical class and present therapeutic limitations in some patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on nifedipine‐induced GH of a switch to a dihydropyridine derivative with a low incidence of GH. Fourteen patients with nifedipine‐induced GH were given a medical exam and a periodontal exam. The following parameters were assessed: probing depth (PD), gingival margin (GM), gingival thickness (GT), plaque index (PI), and gingival index (Gl). Intraoral photographs, study models, and a gingival biopsy for histological examination were taken. Following baseline measures, patients were randomized to continued treatment with nifedipine or an equivalent dose of isradipine in a singleblind fashion. Biweekly periodontal parameters were taken for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, some patients elected to receive 4 weeks of open label isradipine therapy, with biweekly examination continuing through the open label phase. The isradipine treatment arm showed a mean decrease in PD of 0.59 mm at week 8 (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). No other measured parameter (GM, GT, PI, GI) was significantly changed, compared either to baseline or to the alternate treatment arm. Clinically, 60% of patients treated with isradipine exhibited a decrease in hyperplasia, while 66% of patients treated with nifedipine demonstrated an increase in hyperplasia, a significant difference (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). When combined with open label data, patients switching therapy to isradipine exhibited an increase in GM (increase in recession) of 0.74 mm from baseline to week 12 (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). No patients treated with isradipine exhibited an increase in gingival overgrowth. All patients exhibited adequate control of hypertension. We conclude that in hypertensive patients with nifedipine‐induced GH, switching hypertensive therapy to isradipine may result in a regression of GH. When coupled with aggressive oral hygiene treatment, this drug may provide a reasonable option for patients requiring dihydropyridine treatment. <jats:italic>J Periodontol 1997;68:645–650</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0
Prevalence of Amlodipine‐Related Gingival Hyperplasia,"<jats:p>C<jats:sc>alcium channel blockers are known</jats:sc> to contribute to gingival hyperplasia. The vast majority of reports discuss patients taking the drug nifedipine. During the past few years a newer calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, has been used with increasing frequency. To date, six cases have been published indicating that amlodipine may also promote gingival hyperplasia; however, no data have been reported regarding the prevalence of this phenomenon. The purpose of this study was to examine a large group of patients taking amlodipine and determine the prevalence of gingival hyperplasia. One hundred fifty dentate patients who had been taking amlodipine, 5 mg per day for at least 6 months, volunteered to undergo a screening examination for gingival hyperplasia. Mild hyperplasia (&lt;1/3 clinical crown) was found in five patients—a prevalence of 3.3%. This is significantly less (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt;.001) than rates reported for patients taking nifedipine, and not significantly different from rates previously reported in control groups of cardiac patients not taking calcium channel blockers. The results from this group of patients indicated that amlodipine, 5 mg per day, did not induce gingival hyperplasia. <jats:italic>J Periodontol 1997;68:676–678</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0

Danish Multicenter Randomized Study of Invasive Versus Conservative Treatment in Patients With Inducible Ischemia After Thrombolysis in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DANAMI),"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Background</jats:italic>
            The aim of the DANish trial in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DANAMI) study was to compare an invasive strategy of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with a conservative strategy in patients with inducible myocardial ischemia who received thrombolytic treatment for a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            Of the 503 patients randomized to an invasive strategy, PTCA was performed in 266 (52.9%) and CABG in 147 (29.2%) from 2 to 10 weeks after the AMI. Of the 505 patients in the conservative treatment group, only 8 (1.6%) had been revascularized 2 months after the AMI. The patients were followed up from 1 to 4.5 years. The primary end points were mortality, reinfarction, and admission with unstable angina. At 2.4 years’ follow-up (median), mortality was 3.6% in the invasive treatment group and 4.4% in the conservative treatment group (not significant). Invasive treatment was associated with a lower incidence of AMI (5.6% versus 10.5%;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =&lt;.00001) in the invasive and conservative treatment groups, respectively. At 12 months, stable angina pectoris was present in 21% of patients in the invasive treatment group and 43% in the conservative treatment group.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            Invasive treatment in post-AMI patients with inducible ischemia results in a reduction in the incidence of reinfarction, fewer admissions due to unstable angina, and lower prevalence of stable angina. We conclude that patients with inducible ischemia before discharge who have received treatment with thrombolytic drugs for their first AMI should be referred to coronary arteriography and revascularized accordingly.

Effect of the Calcium Antagonist Felodipine as Supplementary Vasodilator Therapy in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure Treated With Enalapril,"<jats:p>

            Despite therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors and digoxin morbidity and mortality in heart failure remain high and might respond favorably to an additional vasodilator.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            Male patients (n=450) with chronic heart failure (cardiac dysfunction and impaired exercise performance) on optimal current therapy (97% enalapril, 89% diuretics) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with felodipine extended release (5 mg BID) or placebo for 3 to 39 months (average, 18 months). Felodipine significantly reduced blood pressure and, at 3 months, increased ejection fraction (2.1% versus −0.1% units in the placebo group,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.001) and reduced plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels (−2.9 versus 26.9 pg/mL in the placebo group,

            =.01) but did not improve exercise tolerance, quality of life, or the need for hospitalization. During long-term follow-up, the favorable effects on ejection fraction and atrial peptide did not persist, but felodipine prevented worsening exercise tolerance and quality of life. In the felodipine and placebo groups, mortality (13.8% versus 12.8%, respectively) and hospitalization (43% versus 42%) rates were similar, and a higher incidence of peripheral edema was the only apparent side effect of felodipine therapy.

          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            Felodipine exerts a well-tolerated additional sustained vasodilator effect in patients with heart failure treated with enalapril, but the only possible long-term benefit was a trend for better exercise tolerance and less depression of quality of life in the second year of treatment. The drug appears to be safe but not clearly efficacious in patients with heart failure.

Salt and Blood Pressure Responses to Calcium Antagonism in Hypertensive Patients,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic>
            Since salt intake may affect blood pressure response to antihypertensive drugs, an individual’s salt-sensitivity status may be an important consideration in the selection of a medication. The purpose of this single-blind study was to assess the impact of salt sensitivity on the antihypertensive effects of isradipine. A total of 21 evaluable hypertensive patients (10 white, 11 black) 35 to 73 years of age (mean 55.9 years) were randomized to a low-salt diet (mean 24-hour urine sodium 100±14 mmol) or a high-salt diet (mean 24-hour urine sodium 210±22 mmol) for 7 weeks, followed by crossover to the other diet after a 2-week washout period. On each diet regimen, patients received placebo for 2 weeks, followed by optimal titration of isradipine (2.5 to 10 mg BID) for blood pressure control during the last 5 weeks. On the high-salt diet, salt-sensitive hypertensives (mean arterial blood pressure increase ≥5 mm Hg, n=5) exhibited a systolic/diastolic blood pressure change of −18.7/−19.6 mm Hg from 157.2/102.9 mm Hg after 5 weeks of isradipine treatment, whereas on a low-salt diet, blood pressure change was −6.9/−12.0 mm Hg from 148.7/97.3 mm Hg. Non–salt-sensitive patients (n=16) exhibited a systolic/diastolic blood pressure change of −12.6/−7.6 mm Hg from 155.3/98.6 mm Hg on the high-salt diet and −19.2/−10.9 mm Hg from 161.0/102.6 mm Hg on the low-salt diet after treatment with isradipine. The absolute blood pressure attained in both salt-sensitive and non–salt-sensitive patients was almost identical with isradipine therapy despite variation in dietary salt, although slightly higher doses of isradipine were required in the salt-sensitive group. Consequently, isradipine, and perhaps calcium antagonists in general, manifests a more robust blood pressure–lowering effect in the setting of high sodium intake. This effect does, however, appear to be largely confined to individuals who are salt sensitive.

            Mibefradil is a new benzimidazolyl-substituted tetraline-derivative calcium antagonist. Its vasodilatory activity combined with an ability to lower heart rate without negative inotropic effects as well as its long duration of action make it a promising anti-ischemic agent.

            Three hundred nine patients with coronary artery disease, stable angina pectoris, and positive exercise tests were randomized to receive mibefradil (50, 100, or 150 mg), amlodipine (10 mg), or placebo. The anti-ischemic effects of mibefradil on exercise test and silent ischemia parameters were assessed. At doses of 100 and 150 mg, mibefradil increased exercise duration (by 55.5 and 51.0 seconds, respectively;

            We performed a multicenter, randomized, 6-month evaluation of the clinical effects of AV junction ablation and DDDR mode-switching pacemaker (Abl+Pm) versus pharmacological treatment in 43 patients with intolerable, recurrent paroxysmal AF of three or more episodes in the previous 6 months not controlled with three or more antiarrhythmic drugs. Before completion of the study, 3 patients in the drug group withdrew because of the severity of their symptoms and 1 patient assigned to the Abl+Pm group in whom the ablation procedure failed.

            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            In patients with paroxysmal AF not controlled by pharmacological therapy, Abl+Pm treatment is highly effective and superior to drug therapy in controlling symptoms and improving quality of life. The discontinuation of drug therapy exposes patients to further recurrences of paroxysmal AF and the risk of developing permanent AF.

Antihypertensive and Renal Effects of Isradipine in Essential Hypertension: Focus on Renin System Activity,"<jats:p> Calcium antagonists are known to exert various effects on the kidney that might modulate their antihypertensive potential. This study evaluated the renal effects, along with the efficacy, of isradipine in two subgroups of patients with mild to moderate essential hyper tension (EH), defined according to plasma renin activity (PRA). Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive 12-week treatment with slow-release isradipine (2.5-5 mg) or placebo. Assessment of PRA related to concurrent 24-hour sodium excretion was used to define patients with high/medium (n=16) and low renin profile (n=10). Urinary albumin excretion (UAE), serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR, as endogenous creatinine clearance) were measured. Blood pressure (BP) decrease with isradipine was greater in the low PRA group as compared with the high/medium PRA group (P&lt;0.05), and normalization of BP was achieved in all low-renin patients compared with 57% in the high/medium PRA group. BP reduction in the placebo group was statistically not significant. Isradipine, but not placebo, induced significant reduction in UAE (P&lt;0.05); the decrease was similar in both PRA groups. Treatment did not cause any significant changes in GFR, PRA, urinary sodium or creatinine excretion, or serum aldosterone or creatinine concentrations. The decrease of BP in the whole isradipine- treated group was inversely correlated with pretreatment serum creatinine as well as with basal urinary creatinine excretion. In conclusion, the antihypertensive effect of isradipine was more pronounced in low-renin EH patients, despite similar effects on renal function and UAE in both PRA groups. </jats:p>",0

Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic>
            —The Hypertension Optimal Treatment Study is a prospective trial conducted in 26 countries. The aims are to (1) evaluate the relationship between three levels of target office diastolic blood pressure (BP) (≤80, ≤85, or ≤90 mm Hg) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients and (2) examine the effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of 75 mg aspirin daily versus placebo. A total of 19 193 patients between 50 and 80 years of age had been randomized by the end of April 1994. Treatment was initiated with felodipine 5 mg daily, and additional therapy was given in accordance with a set protocol. The present substudy of 926 patients performed in nine countries aimed to (1) compare home with office BP in a representative subsample of the HOT population after the titration of treatment was completed and (2) clarify whether the separation into the target groups could be expanded into the out-of-office setting. The differences between office and home measurements in diastolic BP of 0.2 mm Hg (SD, 9; 95% confidence interval, −0.36 to 0.81;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.40) and systolic BP of 0.5 mm Hg (SD, 15; 95% confidence interval, −0.53 to 1.46;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.21) were not significant. The group differences in home BP were 1.9 mm Hg (≤80 versus ≤85) and 1.2 mm Hg (≤85 versus ≤90) for diastolic BP (F=11.69; ANOVA,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt;.0001) and 2.6 and 2.1 mm Hg for systolic BP (F=8.44,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =.0002). Thus, office and home BPs measured with the same semiautomatic device are comparable in treated hypertensive subjects in the HOT Study, and the separation into the target groups based on office readings prevails at home.

Effects of Lisinopril and Nifedipine on the Progression to Overt Albuminuria in IDDM Patients With Incipient Nephropathy and Normal Blood Pressure,"<jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>OBJECTIVE</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Intervention trials on renal function in IDDM patients with microalbuminuria (MA) should adopt the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as an outcome measure. However, normotensive IDDM patients with MA show no change in GFR over a follow-up period of 10 years. Thus, in the present study, we used the cumulative incidence of progression to albuminuria (albumin excretion rate [AER] &amp;gt; 200 μ/min) from MA as the primary endpoint and the yearly increase in AER at a rate of 50% above baseline as the secondary end-point of renal function.</jats:p>
               </jats:sec>
               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Ninety-two normotensive IDDM patients underwent double-blind, double-dummy treatment with either lisinopril or slow-release nifedipine in comparison with placebo. Ten patients discontinued the study during the 3-year follow-up period.</jats:p>
               </jats:sec>
               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>During the 3-year follow-up period, 7 of 34 placebo-treated (20.6%), 2 of 32 lisinopril-treated (6.3%), and 2 of 26 nifedipine-treated (7.7%) patients progressed to clinical albuminuria (Fisher's exact test, P &amp;lt; 0.03). Time-to-event analysis indicated a reduction in the risk of progression to macroalbuminuria of 58.1% (95% CI 27.8−68.4%) in the 32 patients on lisinopril (P &amp;lt; 0.02) and of 62.5% (95% CI 32.5−73.4%) in the 26 patients on nifedipine (P &amp;lt; 0.02) after adjustment for mean blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and baseline AER in comparison with the 34 patients on placebo. Baseline AER was 71 μ/min (range: 20.7−187.3) in progressors and 73 μ/min (range: 20.2−174.1) in nonprogressors (NS). The percentage of patients who showed a &amp;gt; 50% yearly increase of AER above baseline values was significantly lower in the lisinopril group (13 of 32, 40.6%, P &amp;lt; 0.02), but not in the nifedipine group (15 of 26, 57.7%), than in the placebo group (23 of 34, 67.6%). The lisinopril group had significantly lower blood pressure values during follow-up than either the nifedipine (P &amp;lt; 0.05) or the placebo (P &amp;lt; 0.01) group.</jats:p>

                  <jats:title>CONCLUSIONS</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Our data show that both lisinopril and nifedipine are effective in delaying the occurrence of macroalbuminuria in normotensive IDDM patients with MA. As overt proteinuria strongly predicts end-stage renal failure, both treatments appear capable of preventing such a complication in normotensive IDDM patients with MA. However, lisinopril appears more powerful in slowing the course of nephropathy.</jats:p>

Calcium Channel Blockers in Heart Failure,"<jats:p>A considerable effort has been made in the last 15 years to evaluate the safety and efficacy of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in the treatment of patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Available studies have provided strong evidence for a potential detrimental effect of the first-generation calcium antagonists in patients with CHF, indicating the need for great caution when these drugs are used in patients with significant depression of left ventricular systolic function. A number of second-generation CCB have demonstrated a strong vasodilatory effect and favorable hemodynamic action but failed to show a similar improvement in exercise capacity, morbidity and mortality. Moreover, drugs such as nicardipine and nisoldipine have resulted in a detrimental effect in some patients and, therefore, cannot be considered safe when used in patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure. Available information from the V-HeFT III study demonstrate a lack of an unfavorable effect of felodipine on exercise tolerance in patients with chronic heart failure. Although mortality rate was similar in both the felodipine and the placebo group, because of the relatively small number of patients in this study, no clear conclusion can be drawn regarding the effect of felodipine on mortality in patients with CHF. An encouraging signal regarding a potential role of CCB in the treatment of chronic heart failure has been provided by the recently completed PRAISE study. This prospective large-scale study demonstrated the safety of amlodipine, a long-acting dihydropyridine derivative, when used in patients with heart failure due to coronary artery disease. Furthermore, this study demonstrated a substantial reduction in mortality in patients with CHF due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy and provided a strong indication for a potential therapeutic benefit of amlodipine when added to standard CHF therapy in this patient population. No clear explanation is available at the present time regarding the reason for the deleterious effect demonstrated with some of the dihydropyridines and the contrasting benefit seen with amlodipine. Finally, more information regarding the safety and efficacy of dihydropyridines should become available in the next year. The PRAISE II study is ongoing and will provide further information regarding the therapeutic role of amlodipine in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. The MACH-1 study is evaluating the effect of mibefradil, a predominant T-type channel blocker with an ideal activity profile, on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic CHF.</jats:p>",0

At the end of followup, between the two groups there was no significant difference in total serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, or plasma insulin. The patients receiving fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of the combined outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalized angina than those receiving amlodipine (14/189 vs. 27/191; hazards ratio = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.26–0.95).</jats:p>

"Amlodipine: A Randomized, Blinded Clinical Trial in 9 Cats with Systemic Hypertension","<jats:p>The efficacy of amlodipine (AML) was tested in hypertensive cats in a placebo‐controlled, randomized, blinded clinical trial. Five cats were randomized to receive 0.625 mg AML once daily and 4 cats to receive placebo (PLA) once daily. The average systolic blood pressure (SBP) recorded by the Doppler method on day 0 was 212 ± 21 mm Hg in the AML group and 216 ± 32 mm Hg in the PLA group. On day 7, the cats receiving AML had a significantly lower average daily SBP (160 ± 30 mm Hg) but SBP in the PLA group was unchanged (207 ± 31 mm Hg). On day 7, all cats receiving PLA and one cat receiving AML were crossed over to the other group because of inadequate response. Blood pressure did not decrease adequately in 3 cats by day 14 (7 days of PLA and 7 days AML) and the treatment code was broken. Each of these cats was subsequently administered 1.25 mg AML daily. Cats requiring 1.25 mg AML once daily (6.1 kg ± 0.7 kg) weighed significantly more than cats that responded to 0.625 mg AML once daily (4.1 ± 0.7 kg). The average daily SBP recorded in the 6 cats that completed the study was significantly lower after 16 weeks of treatment (152 ± 14 mm Hg) compared to day 0 (221 ± 24 mm Hg). Three cats were euthanized before completion of the study. All 3 cats were responders to AML on day 7. SBPs measured 24 hours after AML administration were similar to the average daily SBP, suggesting that AML effectively controlled SBP for a 24‐hour period. AML was shown to be an effective once‐daily antihypertensive agent when administered to cats at a dosage of 0.18 ± 0.03 mg/kg sid.</jats:p>",0

No clinical differences between CIP and other DIP were found. Most of the patients (66 of 74) completely recovered after cinnarizine withdrawal in 1–16 months. Eleven patients later developed Parkinson's disease; four of them had previously recovered. Five patients had tardive dyskinesia. CIP accounts for a high proportion of DIP referred to neurologists in populations in which cinnarizine is widely prescribed. The symptoms typically resolve after drug withdrawal, although complete recovery may take more than 1 year.</jats:p>",0

After the 12 weeks, the decrease in blood pressure was similar in the imidapril (n=14) and amlodipine (n=13) groups. The increase in renal plasma flow was also similar in both groups.

Effect of Single-Drug Therapy on Reduction of Left Atrial Size in Mild to Moderate Hypertension,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Background</jats:italic>
            —Cardiac effects of hypertension include increased left ventricular (LV) mass and LV hypertrophy, as well as increased left atrial size, a predictor of stroke and atrial fibrillation. Although literature on reduction of LV mass with antihypertensive therapy is extensive, little information is available on effects of treatment on left atrial size.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            —Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomly allocated to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide, or prazosin in a double-masked trial. Two-dimensional targeted M-mode echocardiography was used to assess left atrial size and LV mass at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. Longitudinal analysis examined changes in left atrial size from the baseline study, statistically adjusting for age, race, pretreatment left atrial size and LV mass, and serial measurements of systolic blood pressure, body weight, urinary sodium excretion, and physical activity score. Without adjustment for covariates, only hydrochlorothiazide was associated with decreases in left atrial size from baseline at 8 weeks (−1.0±5.2 mm;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.052), 1 year (−2.0±5.1 mm;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.02), and 2 years (4.6±7.2 mm;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.002). After adjustment for effects of covariates, patients with normal left atrial size had greater reduction (−3.3 mm) in left atrial size at 2 years with hydrochlorothiazide than with any other drug. For patients with left atrial enlargement, left atrial size decreased significantly with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, clonidine, and diltiazem at 1 year and with all treatments at 2 years. However, reduction at 2 years was greater with hydrochlorothiazide than with captopril or prazosin.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            —Antihypertensive drugs differ in their effects on left atrial size. Hydrochlorothiazide was associated with greater overall reduction of left atrial size than other drugs effective for the treatment of hypertension. Reduction of left atrial size with therapy is in part independent of factors known to influence left atrial size, including LV mass and reduction of LV mass with treatment. The clinical benefit of reducing left atrial size with antihypertensive treatment remains to be determined.

Surgical Treatment of Cyclosporine A‐ and Nifedipine‐Induced Gingival Enlargement: Gingivectomy Versus Periodontal Flap,"<jats:p>T<jats:sc>he purpose of this study</jats:sc> was to compare probing depth resolution achieved by gingivectomy and periodontal flap techniques in the treatment of cyclosporine A‐ and nifedipine‐induced gingival enlargement. Ten kidney transplant patients who were receiving cyclosporine A and nifedipine for at least 6 months participated in the study. Five patients were randomly assigned to the gingivectomy group and 5 patients to the periodontal flap group. Only anterior segments of the oral cavity (canine to canine) were surgically treated. Clinical measurements, including probing depths, plaque index, and gingival sulcus index, were taken at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. Results showed that probing depths, while similar for both groups in the first 6 weeks of the study, were significantly shallower for the periodontal flap group when compared to the gingivectomy group at 6 months (2.48 ± 0.34 mm versus 4.87 ± 0.79 mm, respectively) and 1 year (322 ± 0.65 mm versus 6.40 ± 1.02 mm, respectively). Within its limitations, this study suggests that the pocket reduction achieved by the periodontal flap may be sustained for longer periods of time than by the gingivectomy technique in the treatment of cyclosporine A‐ and nifedipine‐induced gingival enlargement. <jats:italic>J Periodontol 1998;69:791–797</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0

"Randomized, Double-Blind Crossover Study to Investigate the Effects of Amlodipine and Isosorbide Mononitrate on the Time Course and Severity of Exercise-Induced Myocardial Stunning","<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Background</jats:italic>
            —Myocardial stunning may cause prolonged left ventricular dysfunction after exercise-induced ischemia that can be attenuated by calcium antagonists in animal models. To assess their effects in humans, we performed a randomized, double-blind crossover study comparing the calcium antagonist amlodipine (10 mg once daily) versus isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN, 50 mg once daily) on postexercise stunning.

            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            —Twenty-four men with chronic stable angina and normal left ventricular function underwent serial quantitative exercise stress echocardiography after 3 weeks on each treatment to assess the degree of postexercise stunning with simultaneous sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion scans at peak stress to quantify the ischemic burden. Exercise time (

            =0.17) were unchanged between treatments. Stunning occurred more often with ISMN than amlodipine (82% versus 48%). The global and segmental stress echocardiography parameters of stunning were attenuated in patients while taking amlodipine compared with ISMN. Shortening fractions and ejection fractions were less impaired 30 minutes after exercise in patients receiving amlodipine (3.5±1.4% versus 2.5±1.4%,

Inhaled nitric oxide as a screening agent for safely identifying responders to oral calcium-channel blockers in primary pulmonary hypertension,"<jats:p>In a subset of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), high doses of oral calcium-channel blockers (CCB) produce a sustained clinical and haemodynamic improvement. However, significant side-effects have been reported during acute testing with CCB. Therefore, to identify accurately patients who may benefit from long-term CCB therapy, there is a need for a safe, potent and short-acting vasodilator. The aim of this study was to compare the acute response to inhaled nitric oxide (NO) and oral high doses of CCB in 33 consecutive patients with PPH. A significant acute vasodilator response was defined by a fall in both mean pulmonary artery pressure and total pulmonary resistance by &gt;20%. Ten patients responded acutely to NO, nine of whom responded acutely to CCB, without any complications. The 23 other patients failed to respond to NO and CCB. In these nonresponders, nine serious adverse events were observed with CCB (38%). There was no clinical or baseline haemodynamic feature predicting acute vasodilator response. Long-term oral treatment with CCB was restricted to the nine acute responders and a sustained clinical and haemodynamic improvement was observed in only six patients. In primary pulmonary hypertension, the acute response rate to high doses of calcium-channel blockers is low (27%). Serious adverse reactions to high doses of calcium-channel blockers during acute testing are frequently observed in nonresponders. It is concluded that nitric oxide may be used as a screening agent for safely identifying patients with primary pulmonary hypertension who respond acutely to calcium-channel blockers and may benefit from long-term treatment with these agents.</jats:p>",0

Metformin: An Old Drug for the Treatment of Diabetes but a New Drug for the Protection of the Endothelium,"<jats:p>The anti-diabetic and oral hypoglycaemic agent metformin, first used clinically in 1958, is today the first choice or ‘gold standard' drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary disease. Of particular importance for the treatment of diabetes, metformin affords protection against diabetes-induced vascular disease. In addition, retrospective analyses suggest that treatment with metformin provides therapeutic benefits to patients with several forms of cancer. Despite almost 60 years of clinical use, the precise cellular mode(s) of action of metformin remains controversial. A direct or indirect role of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the fuel gauge of the cell, has been inferred in many studies, with evidence that activation of AMPK may result from a mild inhibitory effect of metformin on mitochondrial complex 1, which in turn would raise AMP and activate AMPK. Discrepancies, however, between the concentrations of metformin used in in vitro studies versus therapeutic levels suggest that caution should be applied before extending inferences derived from cell-based studies to therapeutic benefits seen in patients. Conceivably, the effects, or some of them, may be at least partially independent of AMPK and/or mitochondrial respiration and reflect a direct effect of either metformin or a minor and, as yet, unidentified putative metabolite of metformin on a target protein(s)/signalling cascade. In this review, we critically evaluate the data from studies that have investigated the pharmacokinetic properties and the cellular and clinical basis for the oral hypoglycaemic, insulin-sensitising and vascular protective effects of metformin.</jats:p>",0

Assessment of Atrioventricular Junction Ablation and VVIR Pacemaker Versus Pharmacological Treatment in Patients With Heart Failure and Chronic Atrial Fibrillation,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Background</jats:italic>
            —Uncontrolled studies have suggested that atrioventricular junction ablation and pacemaker implantation have beneficial effects on quality of life in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF).
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>
            —We performed a multicenter, controlled, randomized, 12-month evaluation of the clinical effects of atrioventricular junction ablation and VVIR pacemaker (Abl+Pm) versus pharmacological (drug) treatment in 66 patients with chronic (lasting &gt;6 months) AF who had clinically manifest heart failure and heart rate &gt;90 bpm on 3 standard ECGs recorded at rest during stable clinical conditions on different days. Before completion of the study, withdrawals occurred in 8 patients of the drug group and in 4 patients of the Abl+Pm group. At the end of the 12 months, the 28 Abl+Pm patients who completed the study showed lower scores in palpitations (−78%;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.000) and effort dyspnea (−22%;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.05) than the 26 of the drug group. Lower scores, although not significant, were also observed for exercise intolerance (−20%), easy fatigue (−17%), chest discomfort (−50%), Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (−14%), New York Heart Association functional classification (−4%), and Activity scale (−12%). The intrapatient comparison between enrollment and month 12 showed that in the Abl+Pm group, all variables except easy fatigue improved significantly from 14% to 82%. However, because an improvement was also observed in the drug group, the difference between the 2 groups was significant only for palpitations (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.000), effort dyspnea (

          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>
            —In patients with heart failure and chronic AF, Abl+Pm treatment is effective and superior to drug therapy in controlling symptoms, although its efficacy appears to be less than that observed in uncontrolled studies because some improvement can also be expected in medically treated patients. Cardiac performance is not modified by the treatment.

                  <jats:title>OBJECTIVE</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Investigators from the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS) previously reported that the isradipine group had a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events than the diuretic group. The ultimate objective of the analyses presented here was to assess how indices of glycemia (specifically, serum glucose, serum insulin, and HbAlc)might have influenced the effects of the two agents on blood pressure control and CVD events.</jats:p>

                  <jats:title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Inclusion criteria included men and women ≥40 years of age with ultrasonographically confirmed carotid atherosclerosis and a diastolic blood pressure of &amp;gt;90 mmHg. Although insulin-dependent diabetic patients were excluded, the three glycemia indices had wide enough ranges to include patients who may be classified as prediabetic. A total of 883 patients were randomized either to the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (CA) isradipine (2.5–5 mg twice a day) or to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (12.5–25 mg twice a day) and followed in double-blind fashion for 3 years.</jats:p>

                  <jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Both treatment groups had achieved comparable control of diastolic blood pressure, and there were no statistically significant differences in any of the glycemia indices, either at baseline or during follow-up. However, the excess isradipine events were noted to be clustered among those patients with elevated baseline levels of HbA1c who also experienced greater blood pressure reductions during follow-up.</jats:p>

                  <jats:title>CONCLUSIONS</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>The increased cardiovascular risk associated with dihydropyridine CAs in prediabetic patients may be an explanation for the overall CA debate.</jats:p>

Comparison of 24‐Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Data in Hypertensive Patients Switched from Nifedipine‐GITS to Nifedipine‐CC,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Study Objective.</jats:bold> To evaluate 24‐hour blood pressure control and frequency of adverse effects in patients with mild to moderate hypertension switched from nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (Nif‐GITS) to nifedipine coat core (Nif‐CC).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Design.</jats:bold> Open‐label, prospective, switch study.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Setting.</jats:bold> University‐affiliated outpatient cardiology clinic.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Subjects.</jats:bold> Twenty patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, who were taking Nif‐GITS 30, 60, or 90 mg/day for 8 weeks or longer.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Interventions.</jats:bold> Patients stabilized with Nif‐GITS 30, 60, or 90 mg were monitored over 24 hours with an ambulatory blood pressure monitor and were then switched to an equivalent dosage of Nif‐CC. After 8 weeks ± 1 week taking Nif‐CC, they were again monitored with a 24‐hour blood pressure monitor. The 24‐hour blood pressure load (percentage of values &gt; 135/85 mm Hg for 24 hrs), daytime blood pressure load (percentage of values &gt; 140/90 mm Hg from 7:00 a.m.–10:00 p.m.), nighttime blood pressure load (percentage of values &gt; 120/80 mm Hg from 10:00 p.m.–7:00 a.m.), diurnal blood pressure variation, average 24‐hour blood pressure, daytime blood pressure, nighttime blood pressure, mean blood pressure for the first 4 hours, and last 8 hours of the dosing interval were measured. Adverse effects such as headache, dizziness, and edema were also reported.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Measurements and Main Results.</jats:bold> No differences in average 24 hour‐blood pressure readings were observed but significant differences in blood pressure control during the first 4 and last 8 hours of the dosing interval were seen. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher after approximately 16 hours in patients switched from Nif‐GITS to Nif‐CC. Although Nif‐CC caused a greater initial response, it was less effective than Nif‐GITS after 16 hours. This could explain the lack of differences in average 24‐hour blood pressure values between formulations. Of the 20 patients, 20% experienced increased headaches, 20% showed signs of increased peripheral edema, and 10% reported occasional dizziness after switching agents. Three patients discontinued Nif‐CC, two as ordered by their primary care physician and one on his own due to headache.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion.</jats:bold> This study suggests that patients switched from Nif‐GITS to Nif‐CC could experience increased blood pressure during the night or toward the end of the dosing interval. They could also experience adverse effects such as headache, edema, and dizziness, which could result in more physician visits and put patients with other disease states such as coronary heart disease at increased risk.</jats:p>",0

Safety of Nifedipine in Angina Pectoris,"<jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic>
            —Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with stable angina receiving nifedipine as monotherapy or combination therapy and in active drug controls. A MEDLARS search of published articles from 1966 to 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish, supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies, identified 60 randomized controlled trials that met protocol criteria. Blinded articles were extracted by 2 physicians. The pooled risks of death, withdrawal, and cardiovascular event were computed and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) for all nifedipine formulations and relative to same study control drug regimens. Thirty cardiovascular events were reported in 2635 nifedipine exposures (1.14%) and 19 events in 2655 other active drug exposures (0.72%). Unadjusted ORs for nifedipine versus controls were 1.40 (95% CI, 0.56 to 3.49) for major events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedure), 1.75 (95% CI, 0.83 to 3.67) for increased angina, and 1.61 (95% CI, 0.91 to 2.87) for all events (major events plus increased angina). Episodes of increased angina were more frequent on immediate-release nifedipine (OR, 4.19 [95% CI, 1.41 to 12.49]) and on nifedipine monotherapy (OR, 2.61 [95% CI, 1.30 to 5.26]). The OR for immediate-release nifedipine was significantly higher than that for sustained-release/extended-release nifedipine (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.001), and the OR for nifedipine monotherapy was higher than that for nifedipine combination therapy (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            =0.03). Increased risks of cardiovascular events in patients with stable angina on nifedipine were due primarily to more episodes of increased angina, confined to the immediate-release formulation and to nifedipine monotherapy.
