Porcine kobuviruses (PoKoVs) are ubiquitously distributed in pig populations 
worldwide and are thought to be enteric viruses in swine. Although PoKoVs have 
been detected in pigs in Japan, no complete genome data for Japanese PoKoVs are 
available. In the present study, 24 nearly complete or complete sequences of the 
PoKoV genome obtained from 10 diarrheic feces and 14 non-diarrheic feces of 
Japanese pigs were analyzed using a metagenomics approach. Japanese PoKoVs 
shared 85.2-100% identity with the complete coding nucleotide (nt) sequences and 
the closest relationship of 85.1-98.3% with PoKoVs from other countries. Twenty 
of 24 Japanese PoKoVs carried a deletion of 90 nt in the 2B coding region. 
Phylogenetic tree analyses revealed that PoKoVs were not grouped according to 
their geographical region of origin and the phylogenetic trees of the L, P1, P2, 
and P3 genetic regions showed topologies different from each other. Similarity 
plot analysis using strains from a single farm revealed partially different 
similarity patterns among strains from identical farm origins, suggesting that 
recombination events had occurred. These results indicate that various PoKoV 
strains are prevalent and not restricted geographically on pig farms worldwide 
and the coexistence of multiple strains leads to recombination events of PoKoVs 
and contributes to the genetic diversity and evolution of PoKoVs.

"Genome Characterization of a Pathogenic Porcine Rotavirus B Strain Identified in Buryat Republic, Russia in 2015","<jats:p>An outbreak of enteric disease of unknown etiology with 60% morbidity and 8% mortality in weaning piglets occurred in November 2015 on a farm in Buryat Republic, Russia. Metagenomic sequencing revealed the presence of rotavirus B in feces from diseased piglets while no other pathogens were identified. Clinical disease was reproduced in experimentally infected piglets, yielding the 11 RVB gene segments for strain Buryat15, with an RVB genotype constellation of G12-P[4]-I13-R4-C4-M4-A8-N10-T4-E4-H7. This genotype constellation has also been identified in the United States. While the Buryat15 VP7 protein lacked unique amino acid differences in the predicted neutralizing epitopes compared to the previously published swine RVB G12 strains, this report of RVB in Russian swine increases our epidemiological knowledge on the global prevalence and genetic diversity of RVB.</jats:p>",1
Antibiotics in Feed Induce Prophages in Swine Fecal Microbiomes,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Antibiotics are a cost-effective tool for improving feed efficiency and preventing disease in agricultural animals, but the full scope of their collateral effects is not understood. Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; therefore, one collateral effect could be prophage induction in the gut microbiome at large. Here we used metagenomics to evaluate the effect of two antibiotics in feed (carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and penicillin]) on swine intestinal phage metagenomes (viromes). We also monitored the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population shifts in both the phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes, such as multidrug resistance efflux pumps, were identified in the viromes, but in-feed antibiotics caused no significant changes in their abundance. The abundance of phage integrase-encoding genes was significantly increased in the viromes of medicated swine over that in the viromes of nonmedicated swine, demonstrating the induction of prophages with antibiotic treatment. Phage-bacterium population dynamics were also examined. We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            bacteria (prey) when
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            phages (predators) were abundant, supporting the “kill-the-winner” ecological model of population dynamics in the swine fecal microbiome. The data show that gut ecosystem dynamics are influenced by phages and that prophage induction is a collateral effect of in-feed antibiotics.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            This study advances our knowledge of the collateral effects of in-feed antibiotics at a time in which the widespread use of “growth-promoting” antibiotics in agriculture is under scrutiny. Using comparative metagenomics, we show that prophages are induced by in-feed antibiotics in swine fecal microbiomes and that antibiotic resistance genes were detected in most viromes. This suggests that in-feed antibiotics are contributing to phage-mediated gene transfer, potentially of antibiotic resistance genes, in the swine gut. Additionally, the so-called “kill-the-winner” model of phage-bacterium population dynamics has been shown in aquatic ecosystems but met with conflicting evidence in gut ecosystems. The data support the idea that swine fecal
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            bacteria and their phages follow the kill-the-winner model. Understanding the role of phages in gut microbial ecology is an essential component of the antibiotic resistance problem and of developing potential mitigation strategies.

Pigs harbor a variety of viruses that are closely related to human viruses and 
are suspected to have zoonotic potential. Little is known about the presence of 
viruses in smallholder farms where pigs are in close contact with humans and 
wildlife. This study provides insight into viral communities and the prevalence 
and characteristics of enteric viral co-infections in smallholder pigs in East 
Africa. Sequence-independent amplification and high-throughput sequencing were 
applied to the metagenomics analysis of viruses in feces collected from 
asymptomatic pigs. A total of 47,213 de novo-assembled contigs were constructed 
and compared with sequences from the GenBank database. Blastx search results 
revealed that 1039 contigs (>200 nt) were related to viral sequences in the 
GenBank database. Of the 1039 contigs, 612 were not assigned to any viral taxa 
because they had little similarity to known viral genomic or protein sequences, 
while 427 contigs had a high level of sequence similarity to known viruses and 
were assigned to viral taxa. The most frequent contigs related to mammalian 
viruses resembling members of the viral genera Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Bocavirus, 
Circovirus, and Kobuvirus. Other less abundant contigs were related to members 
of the genera Sapelovirus, Pasivirus, Posavirus, Teschovirus and Picobirnavirus. 
This is the first report on the diversity of the fecal virome of pig populations 
in East Africa. The findings of the present study help to elucidate the etiology 
of diarrheal diseases in pigs and identify potential zoonotic and emerging 
viruses in the region. Further investigations are required to compare the 
incidence of these viruses in healthy and diseased pigs in order to better 
elucidate their pathogenic role.

Identification of a Novel Hepacivirus in Domestic Cattle from Germany,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to represent one of the most significant threats to human health. In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses, and dogs, indicating a widespread distribution of hepaciviruses among animals. By applying unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a novel virus of the genus
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepacivirus</jats:named-content>
            was discovered in a bovine serum sample.
            <jats:italic>De novo</jats:italic>

            . Viral RNA screening determined that 1.6% (

            5) of 158 investigated cattle herds in Germany were positive for bovine hepacivirus. Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of animals from one dairy herd proved that a substantial percentage of cows were infected, with some of them being viremic for over 6 months. Clinical and postmortem examination revealed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from different organs and tissues, together with the presence of an miR-122 binding site in the viral genome, strongly suggests a liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for HCV infections in humans.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Livestock animals act as important sources for emerging pathogens. In particular, their large herd size and the existence of multiple ways of direct and food-borne infection routes emphasize their role as virus reservoirs. Apart from the search for novel viruses, detailed characterization of these pathogens is indispensable in the context of risk analysis. Here, we describe the identification of a novel HCV-like virus in cattle. In addition, determination of the prevalence and of the course of infection in cattle herds provides valuable insights into the biology of this novel virus. The results presented here form a basis for future studies targeting viral pathogenesis of bovine hepaciviruses and their potential to establish zoonotic infections.

Papillomaviruses are a diverse group of viruses that are known to infect a wide 
range of animal species. Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are divided into at 
least 21 genotypes (BPV1 to BPV21),  with most BPV isolates/strains described to 
date belonging to one of four genera, including Deltapapillomavirus, 
Xipapillomavirus, Epsilonpapillomavirus and Dyoxipapillomavirus. Here, we 
describe the identification and genetic characterization of a new BPV type in 
the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. A farm in the state of New York, USA, reported 
chronic cases of vulvovaginitis in Holstein cows in 2016. Biopsies and/or swab 
samples collected from the vaginal mucosa were subjected to diagnostic 
investigation. Conventional diagnostic assays yielded negative results, and 
vaginal swab samples were subjected to viral metagenomic sequencing. Notably, 
BLAST searches revealed a papillomavirus genome with 7480 bp in length (67% nt 
sequence identity to BPV16). Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene 
of the papillomavirus identified here (tentatively named BPV22) revealed that it 
clusters with members of the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. Interestingly, the 
recently identified BPV16, which was detected in fibropapilloma lesions in 
cattle also clusters within the Dyokappapapillomavirus group. Each virus, 
however, forms a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree. These results 
indicate that the putative BPV22 represents the second BPV within the genus 
Dyokappapapillomavirus.

Phage–bacteria relationships and CRISPR elements revealed by a metagenomic survey of the rumen microbiome,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play an important role in balancing microbes within an ecosystem and facilitating horizontal gene transfer. Although bacteriophages are abundant in rumen environments, little is known about the types of viruses present or their interaction with the rumen microbiome. We undertook random pyrosequencing of virus‐enriched metagenomes (viromes) isolated from bovine rumen fluid and analysed the resulting data using comparative metagenomics. A high level of diversity was observed with up to 28 000 different viral genotypes obtained from each environment. The majority (∼78%) of sequences did not match any previously described virus. Prophages outnumbered lytic phages approximately 2:1 with the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types being associated with members of the dominant rumen phyla (<jats:italic>Firmicutes</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Proteobacteria</jats:italic>). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed an enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. We expanded our analysis to include previously described metagenomic data and 14 reference genomes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were detected in most of the microbial genomes, suggesting previous interactions between viral and microbial communities.</jats:p>",1

Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) has been found to be the causative agent of 
postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). However, PCV-2 is a 
ubiquitous virus in the swine population and a majority of pigs infected with 
PCV-2 do not develop the disease. Different factors such as age, maintenance, 
the genetics of PCV-2, other pathogens, etc. have been suggested to contribute 
to the development of PMWS. However, so far no proven connection between any of 
these factors and the disease development has been found. In this study we 
explored the possible presence of other so far unknown DNA containing infectious 
agents in lymph nodes collected from Swedish pigs with confirmed PMWS through 
random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority 
of the amplified genetic sequences belonged to PCV-2, we also found genome 
sequences of Torque Teno virus (TTV) and of a novel parvovirus. The detection of 
TTV was expected since like PCV-2, TTV has been found to have high prevalence in 
pigs around the world. We were able to amplify a longer region of the parvovirus 
genome, consisting of the entire NP1 and partial VP1/2. By comparative analysis 
of the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic studies we propose that this is a 
novel porcine parvovirus, with genetic relationship to bocaviruses.

The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies have allowed the 
possibility to investigate and characterise the entire microbiome of 
individuals, providing better insight to the complex interaction between 
different microorganisms. This will help to understand how the microbiome 
influence the susceptibility of secondary agents and development of disease. We 
have applied viral metagenomics to investigate the virome of lymph nodes from 
Swedish pigs suffering from the multifactorial disease postweaning multisystemic 
wasting syndrome (PMWS) as well as from healthy pigs. The aim is to increase 
knowledge of potential viruses, apart from porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), 
involved in PMWS development as well as to increase knowledge on the virome of 
healthy individuals. In healthy individuals, a diverse viral flora was seen with 
several different viruses present simultaneously. The majority of the identified 
viruses were small linear and circular DNA viruses, such as different 
circoviruses, anelloviruses and bocaviruses. In the pigs suffering from PMWS, 
PCV2 sequences were, as expected, detected to a high extent but other viruses 
were also identified in the background of PCV2. Apart from DNA viruses also RNA 
viruses were identified, among them were a porcine pestivirus showing high 
similarity to a recently (in 2015) discovered atypical porcine pestivirus in the 
US. Majority of the viruses identified in the background of PCV2 in PMWS pigs 
could also be identified in the healthy pigs. PCV2 sequences were also 
identified in the healthy pigs but to a much lower extent than in PMWS affected 
pigs. Although the method used here is not quantitative the very clear 
difference in amount of PCV2 sequences in PMWS affected pigs and healthy pigs 
most likely reflect the very strong replication of PCV2 known to be a hallmark 
of PMWS. Taken together, these findings illustrate that pigs appear to have a 
considerable viral flora consisting to a large extent of small single-stranded 
and circular DNA viruses. Future research on these types of viruses will help to 
better understand the role that these ubiquitous viruses may have on health and 
disease of pigs. We also demonstrate for the first time, in Europe, the presence 
of a novel porcine pestivirus.

Characterisation of the Virome of Tonsils from Conventional Pigs and from Specific Pathogen-Free Pigs,"<jats:p>Porcine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by a number of different microorganisms, as well as by non-infectious factors such as the management and environment of the animals. It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development.</jats:p>",1
Identification and complete genome characterization of a novel picornavirus in turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),"<jats:p>Members of the family <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic> are important pathogens of humans and animals, although compared with the thousands of known bird species (&gt;10 000), only a few (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 11) picornaviruses have been identified from avian sources. This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples collected from eight turkey farms in Hungary. Using RT-PCR, both healthy (two of three) and affected (seven of eight) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome were shown to be shedding viruses in seven (88 %) of the eight farms. The viral genome sequence (turkey/M176/2011/HUN; GenBank accession no. JQ691613) shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (96 %) to the partial P3 genome region of a picornavirus reported recently in turkey and chickens from the USA and probably belongs to the same species. In the P1 and P2 regions, turkey/M176/2011/HUN is related most closely to, but distinct from, the kobuviruses and turdivirus 1. Complete genome analysis revealed the presence of characteristic picornaviral amino acid motifs, a potential type II-like 5′ UTR internal ribosome entry site (first identified among avian-origin picornaviruses) and a conserved, 48 nt long ‘barbell-like’ structure found at the 3′ UTR of turkey/M176/2011/HUN and members of the picornavirus genera <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Kobuvirus</jats:italic>. The general presence of turkey picornavirus – a novel picornavirus species – in faecal samples from healthy and affected turkeys in Hungary and in the USA suggests the worldwide occurrence and endemic circulation of this virus in turkey farms. Further studies are needed to investigate the aetiological role and pathogenic potential of this picornavirus in food animals.</jats:p>",1
Genetic characterization of a novel picornavirus in turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) distinct from turkey galliviruses and megriviruses and distantly related to the members of the genus Avihepatovirus,"<jats:p>This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples of healthy (1/3) and affected (6/8) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome in Hungary. The virus was detected at seven of the eight farms examined. The turkey/M176-TuASV/2011/HUN genome (KC465954) was genetically different from the currently known picornaviruses of turkey origin (megriviruses and galliviruses), and showed distant phylogenetic relationship and common genomic features (e.g. uncleaved VP0 and three predicted and unrelated 2A polypeptides) to duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) of the genus <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic>. The complete genome analysis revealed multiple distinct genome features like the presence of two in-tandem aphthovirus 2A-like sequence repeats with DxExNPG/P ‘ribosome-skipping’ sites (76 %, 23/30 amino acids identical), with the first aphthovirus 2A-like sequence being located at the end of the VP1 capsid protein (VP1/2A1 ‘ribosome-skipping’ site). The phylogenetic analyses, low sequence identity (33, 32 and 36 % amino acid identity in P1, P2 and P3 regions) to DHAV, and the type II-like internal ribosome entry site suggests that this turkey picornavirus is related to, but distinct from the genus <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> and it could be the founding member of a novel <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> sister-clade genus.

Our results could help us to better understand the evolution and diversity (in terms of sequence and genome layout) of picornaviruses.

Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) of family Picobirnaviridae have bisegmented (S1 and S2 
segments), double-stranded RNA genomes. In this study a total of N = 12 complete 
chicken PBVs (ChPBV) segments (N = 5 of S1 and N = 7 of S2, Acc. Nos.: 
MH425579-90) were determined using viral metagenomic and RT-PCR techniques from 
a single cloacal sample of a diarrheic chicken. The identified ChPBV segments 
are unrelated to each other and distant from all of the currently known PBVs. In 
silico sequence analyses revealed the presence of conserved prokaryotic 
Shine-Dalgarno-like (SD-like) sequences upstream of the three presumed open 
reading frames (ORFs) of the S1 and a single presumed ORF of the S2 segments. 
According to the results of expression analyses in E. coli using 6xHis-tagged 
recombinant ChPBV segment 1 construct and Western blot these SD-like sequences 
are functional in vivo suggesting that S1 of study PBVs can contain three ORFs 
and supporting the bacteriophage-nature of PBVs.

Neurotropic Astrovirus in Cattle with Nonsuppurative Encephalitis in Europe,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Encephalitis is a frequently diagnosed condition in cattle with neurological diseases. Many affected animals present with a nonsuppurative inflammatory reaction pattern in the brain. While this pattern supports a viral etiology, the causative pathogen remains unknown in a large proportion of cases. Using viral metagenomics, we identified an astrovirus (bovine astrovirus [BoAstV]-CH13) in the brain of a cow with nonsuppurative encephalitis. Additionally, BoAstV RNA was detected with reverse transcription-PCR and
            <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
            hybridization in about one fourth (5/22 animals) of cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis of unknown etiology. Viral RNA was found primarily in neurons and at the site of pathology. These findings support the notion that BoAstV infection is a common cause of encephalitis in cattle. Phylogenetically, BoAstV-CH13 was closely related to rare astrovirus isolates from encephalitis cases in animals and a human patient. Future research needs to be directed toward the pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiology, and potential cross-species transmission of these neurotropic astroviruses.

An RVB strain was identified in pooled intestinal samples from Alpine caprine kids (between 2 and 3 days of age) experiencing high (&gt;90 %) morbidity, and the complete caprine RVB genome was characterized. Histology revealed villus atrophy, the samples tested positive for RVB by real-time RT-PCR and metagenomic next-generation sequencing identified only RVB and orf virus. In the VP4 gene segment, the caprine RVB strain had a higher percentage nucleotide identity to the Indian bovine RVB strains than to the Japanese bovine RVB strains, but the VP7, VP6, VP2, NSP1, NSP2 and NSP5 gene segments of the American caprine RVB strain were genetically related to the Japanese bovine RVB strains. The results indicate a lack of RVB sequences to understand reassortment or the evolutionary relationship of RVB strains from cattle and goats.</jats:p>",1

The rapid discovery of novel viruses using next generation sequencing (NGS) 
technologies including DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq, has greatly expanded our 
understanding of viral diversity in recent years. The timely identification of 
novel viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control 
emerging infectious diseases caused by novel viruses. In this study, we 
identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct with chicken infectious 
bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a 
potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by 
sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also performed a survey of 
CoVs in domestic fowls in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV 
positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral 
N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several 
region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can 
infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. 
Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some 
host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and 
indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this 
study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls. Taken 
together, this study shed new insight into the diversity, distribution, 
evolution and control of avian CoVs.

BACKGROUND: Emergence and re-emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) 
in North America, Asia and Europe has caused severe economic loss to the global 
swine industry. However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on 
disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have 
made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites 
for any host.
METHODS: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in 
PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on 
next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab 
samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015-2016 were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence 
of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including 
Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 
67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 
28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus 
(3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone 
whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an 
extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, 
Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae.

"A novel astrovirus species in the gut of yaks with diarrhoea in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, 2013","<jats:p>The yak (<jats:italic>Bos grunniens</jats:italic>) is an iconic symbol in the high-altitude region of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Diarrhoea is a common disease in yaks, resulting in major economic losses. To investigate the diversity of viral species, we reported the metagenomics-derived virome in a pooled faecal sample of 20 diarrhoeic yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhoeic samples, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, were influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared with healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrhoeal samples, indicating a correlation with the clinical symptoms of diarrhoea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a near-full genome was obtained from a diarrhoeic sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4–66.2 % similarity with other related bovine AstVs from faeces. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome demonstrated that the yak AstV fell within the bovine AstVs cluster, but was located in a unique lineage, suggesting a novel AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had closer similarity and genetically relationship with deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than that of the bovine AstVs.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most 
economically important diseases in swine caused by porcine reproductive and 
respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Genome sequences of sixty-six PRRSV strains 
were obtained using metagenomic sequencing of serum samples collected in the 
U.S. in 2014 to explore contemporary genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of 
the genes encoding the envelope proteins identified four to eight distinct 
lineages with >87% intraclade identity. To explore the effect of the observed 
genetic diversity on antigenicity, the genome regions encoding either 
GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M in strain SD95-21 were replaced with alleles from each of 
eight distinct PRRSV strains using reverse genetics. The GP2a-GP3-GP4 region 
from only four of the eight strains yielded viable recombinant virus. When 
viable, both GP2a-GP3-GP4 and GP5-M variably affected antigenicity. A 
strain-dependent significant loss in cross reactivity was variably observed by 
indirect immunofluorescence assays using antisera from pigs vaccinated with 
commercial modified-live vaccines following replacement of GP2a-GP3-GP4 or 
GP5-M. Significantly reduced neutralization titers were similarly measured using 
antisera from naturally PRRSV-exposed pigs. These results illustrate the need to 
consider genomic regions besides GP5 for PRRSV epidemiology and vaccination.

Using metagenomics and molecular cloning methods, we characterized five novel 
small, circular viral genomes from pig feces that are distantly related to 
chimpanzee and porcine stool-associated circular viruses, (ChiSCV and PoSCV1). 
Phylogenetic analysis placed these viruses into a highly divergent clade of this 
rapidly growing new viral family. This new clade of viruses, provisionally named 
porcine stool-associated circular virus 2 and 3 (PoSCV2 and PoSCV3), encodes a 
stem-loop structure (presumably the origin of DNA replication) in the small 
intergenic region and a replication initiator protein commonly found in other 
biological systems that replicate their genomes via the rolling-circle 
mechanism. Furthermore, these viruses also exhibit three additional overlapping 
open reading frames in the large intergenic region between the capsid and 
replication initiator protein genes.

A novel bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) genotype comprising 5394 nt was identified by 
next generation sequencing from sera of healthy cattle at different age groups 
farmed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The genome organization of new 
BPV2 genotype retains the two ORFs typical of members of the Parvovirinae with 
86.4 % of overall nucleotide sequence identities in comparison to other members 
of the subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis revealed similar clustering with two 
previously described bovine BPV2 within the genus Copiparvovirus. No significant 
differences (P ≥ 0.05) were detected in the distribution of BPV2 infection in 
cattle at different age groups. This is the third complete or near complete 
genome sequence of BPV2 reported to date and may contribute to a better 
understanding of the biology of copiparvoviruses and its interactions with the 
host.

Viral enteric disease is an ongoing economic burden to poultry producers 
worldwide, and despite considerable research, no single virus has emerged as a 
likely causative agent and target for prevention and control efforts. 
Historically, electron microscopy has been used to identify suspect viruses, 
with many small, round viruses eluding classification based solely on 
morphology. National and regional surveys using molecular diagnostics have 
revealed that suspect viruses continuously circulate in United States poultry, 
with many viruses appearing concomitantly and in healthy birds. High-throughput 
nucleic acid pyrosequencing is a powerful diagnostic technology capable of 
determining the full genomic repertoire present in a complex environmental 
sample. We utilized the Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX platform to compile an 
RNA virus metagenome from turkey flocks experiencing enteric disease. This 
approach yielded numerous sequences homologous to viruses in the BLAST nr 
protein database, many of which have not been described in turkeys. Our analysis 
of this turkey gut RNA metagenome focuses in particular on the turkey-origin 
members of the Picornavirales, the Caliciviridae, and the turkey 
Picobirnaviruses.

Novel Parvoviruses from Wild and Domestic Animals in Brazil Provide New Insights into Parvovirus Distribution and Diversity,"<jats:p>Parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) are small, single-stranded DNA viruses. Many parvoviral pathogens of medical, veterinary and ecological importance have been identified. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate the diversity of parvoviruses infecting wild and domestic animals in Brazil. We identified 21 parvovirus sequences (including twelve nearly complete genomes and nine partial genomes) in samples derived from rodents, bats, opossums, birds and cattle in Pernambuco, São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul states. These sequences were investigated using phylogenetic and distance-based approaches and were thereby classified into eight parvovirus species (six of which have not been described previously), representing six distinct genera in the subfamily Parvovirinae. Our findings extend the known biogeographic range of previously characterized parvovirus species and the known host range of three parvovirus genera (Dependovirus, Aveparvovirus and Tetraparvovirus). Moreover, our investigation provides a window into the ecological dynamics of parvovirus infections in vertebrates, revealing that many parvovirus genera contain well-defined sub-lineages that circulate widely throughout the world within particular taxonomic groups of hosts.</jats:p>",1

Recent studies show that human skin at homeostasis is a complex ecosystem whose 
virome include circular DNA viruses, especially papillomaviruses and 
polyomaviruses. To determine the chicken skin virome in comparison with human 
skin virome, a chicken swabs pool sample from fifteen indoor healthy chickens of 
five genetic backgrounds was examined for the presence of DNA viruses by 
high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The results indicate a predominance of 
herpesviruses from the Mardivirus genus, coming from either vaccinal origin or 
presumably asymptomatic infection. Despite the high sensitivity of the HTS 
method used herein to detect small circular DNA viruses, we did not detect any 
papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, or circoviruses, indicating that these viruses 
may not be resident of the chicken skin. The results suggest that the turkey 
herpesvirus is a resident of chicken skin in vaccinated chickens. This study 
indicates major differences between the skin viromes of chickens and humans. The 
origin of this difference remains to be further studied in relation with skin 
physiology, environment, or virus population dynamics.

Heparin is one of the main pharmaceutical products manufactured from raw animal 
material. In order to describe the viral burden associated with this raw 
material, we performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on mucus samples 
destined for heparin manufacturing, which were collected from European pigs. We 
identified Circoviridae and Parvoviridae members as the most prevalent 
contaminating viruses, together with viruses from the Picornaviridae, 
Astroviridae, Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Adenoviridae, Birnaviridae, and 
Anelloviridae families. Putative new viral species were also identified. The 
load of several known or novel small non-enveloped viruses, which are 
particularly difficult to inactivate or eliminate during heparin processing, was 
quantified by qPCR. Analysis of the combined HTS and specific qPCR results will 
influence the refining and validation of inactivation procedures, as well as 
aiding in risk analysis of viral heparin contamination.

Vampire bats are the only mammals known to feed exclusively on blood from other 
animals, often from domestic cattle. We tested the hypothesis that the 
adaptation of vampire bats to hematophagy would have resulted in shared viral 
communities among vampire bats and cattle, as a direct result of historic 
spillover events occurring due to hematophagy. We analyzed the presence of 
different viruses in sample populations of sympatric bat and prey populations 
and searched for shared viruses between taxa. A limited number of DNA viral 
groups were detected within each species. However, there was no evidence for a 
shared viral community among the vampire bat and cattle populations tested.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is widespread in the global pig population. 
Although clinically inapparent in pigs, HEV infection is the cause of Hepatitis 
E in humans and transmission via the food chain has been established. Following 
a 2013 study that investigated prevalence of HEV infection in UK slaughter-age 
pigs samples indicating highest viral load were selected for further 
characterisation. High throughput sequencing was used to obtain the complete 
coding sequence from five samples. An in-frame insertion was observed within the 
HEV hypervariable region in two samples. To interrogate whether this mutation 
may be the cause of high-level viraemia and faecal shedding as observed in the 
sampled pigs virus isolation and culture was conducted. Based on viral growth 
kinetics there was no evidence that these insertions affected replication 
efficiency in vitro, suggesting as yet undetermined host factors may affect the 
course of infection and consequently the risk of foodborne transmission.

In this study, a novel circular replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding 
single stranded (CRESS) DNA virus was discovered in diarrheic sample of a calf 
with severe hemorrhagic enteritis. The virus, named Bo-Circo-like virus CH, has 
a circular genome with 3909 nucleotides (nt). Six putative open reading frames 
(ORFs) were identified, including Rep, capsid (Cap) and four proteins of unknown 
function. Both the genome size and the number as well as the organization of 
encoded ORFs, Bo-Circo-like virus CH is most closely related to Po-Circo-like 
virus 21 detected in pig faeces. A preliminary survey using specific primers for 
the Rep region showed that 5.3% (4/75) of diarrheic samples were positive for 
Bo-Circo-like virus, and all 42 healthy samples were negative. In conclusion, 
our results indicate that Bo-Circo-like virus CH may represent a new virus in 
bovine. Further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between 
the virus infection and diarrhea.

Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea in Europe: In-Detail Analyses of Disease Dynamics and Molecular Epidemiology,"<jats:p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease of swine caused by the eponymous virus (PEDV) which belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae virus family. Following the disastrous outbreaks in Asia and the United States, PEDV has been detected also in Europe. In order to better understand the overall situation, the molecular epidemiology, and factors that might influence the most variable disease impact; 40 samples from swine feces were collected from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries and sequenced by shot-gun next-generation sequencing. A total of 38 new PEDV complete coding sequences were generated. When compared on a global scale, all investigated sequences from Central and South-Eastern Europe formed a rather homogeneous PEDV S INDEL cluster, suggesting a recent re-introduction. However, in-detail analyses revealed two new clusters and putative ancestor strains. Based on the available background data, correlations between clusters and location, farm type or clinical presentation could not be established. Additionally, the impact of secondary infections was explored using the metagenomic data sets. While several coinfections were observed, no correlation was found with disease courses. However, in addition to the PEDV genomes, ten complete viral coding sequences from nine different data sets were reconstructed each representing new virus strains. In detail, three pasivirus A strains, two astroviruses, a porcine sapelovirus, a kobuvirus, a porcine torovirus, a posavirus, and an enterobacteria phage were almost fully sequenced.</jats:p>",1

In this study, a novel parvovirus (strain swine/Zsana3/2013/HUN, KT965075) was 
detected in domestic pigs and genetically characterized by viral metagenomics 
and PCR methods. The novel parvovirus was distantly related to the human 
bufaviruses and was detected in 19 (90.5 %) of the 21 and five (33.3 %) of the 
15 faecal samples collected from animals with and without cases of posterior 
paraplegia of unknown etiology from five affected farms and one control farm in 
Hungary, respectively. Swine/Zsana3/2013/HUN is highly prevalent in domestic 
pigs and potentially represents a novel parvovirus species in the subfamily 
Parvovirinae.

Bovine rhinitis viruses (BRV) are established etiological agents of bovine 
respiratory disease complex however little research into their epidemiology and 
ecology has been published for several decades. In the U.S., only bovine 
rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) has been identified while bovine rhinitis A virus 2 
(BRAV2) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) were previously only identified in 
England and Japan, respectively. Metagenomic sequencing of a nasal swab from a 
bovine respiratory disease (BRD) diagnostic submission from Kansas identified 
contigs with approximately 90% nucleotide similarity to BRAV2 and BRBV. A 
combination of de novo and templated assemblies using reference genomes yielded 
near complete BRAV2 and BRBV genomes. The near complete genome of bovine 
rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) was also determined from a historical isolate to 
enable further molecular epidemiological studies. A 5'-nuclease reverse 
transcription PCR assay targeting the 3D polymerase gene was designed and used 
to screen 204 archived BRD clinical specimens. Thirteen (6.4%) were positive. 
Metagenomic sequencing of six positive samples identified mixed BRAV1/BRAV2, 
BRAV1/BRBV and BRAV2/BRBV infections for five samples. One sample showed 
infection only with BRAV1. Seroprevalence studies using a cell culture adapted 
BRBV found immunofluorescence assay-reactive antibodies were common in the herds 
analyzed. Altogether, these results demonstrate that BRV infections are common 
in cattle with respiratory disease and that BRAV1, BRAV2 and BRBV co-circulate 
in U.S. cattle and have high similarity to viruses isolated more than 30 years 
ago from diverse locations.

Pestiviruses are some of the most significant pathogens affecting ruminants and 
swine. Here, we assembled a 11 276 bp contig encoding a predicted 3635 aa 
polyprotein from porcine serum with 68 % pairwise identity to that of a recently 
partially characterized Rhinolophus affinis pestivirus (RaPV) and approximately 
25-28 % pairwise identity to those of other pestiviruses. The virus was 
provisionally named atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV). Metagenomic sequencing 
of 182 serum samples identified four additional APPV-positive samples. Positive 
samples originated from five states and ELISAs using recombinant APPV Erns found 
cross-reactive antibodies in 94 % of a collection of porcine serum samples, 
suggesting widespread distribution of APPV in the US swine herd. The molecular 
and serological results suggest that APPV is a novel, highly divergent porcine 
pestivirus widely distributed in US pigs.

De novo assembly of metagenomic sequencing reads from feces from a clinically 
normal pig identified two approximately 9 kb contigs which each consisted of a 
single large open reading frame. While one contig encoded a predicted 2990 amino 
acid protein with 83 % identity to the recently described posavirus 1, the other 
contig encoded a predicted 2942 amino acid protein with only 25 % identity 
limited to the genomic region encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 
of posavirus 2. Besides RdRp, search of the conserved domain database identified 
domains associated with picornavirus capsid proteins but failed to identify 
picornaviral helicase and proteinase domains. In addition, a domain representing 
a family of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma immunoglobulin-blocking virulence proteins 
was identified near the 5'-terminus. Phylogenetic analysis found a distant 
relationship between this novel virus, provisionally named posavirus 3, to the 
unclassified posaviruses and fisavirus which are proposed to represent different 
genera in a novel family of the Picornavirales.

Feral swine are known reservoirs for various pathogens that can adversely affect 
domestic animals. To assess the viral ecology of feral swine in the USA, 
metagenomic sequencing was performed on 100 pooled nasal swabs. The virome was 
dominated by small, ssDNA viruses belonging to the families Circoviridae, 
Anelloviridae and Parvovirinae. Only four RNA viruses were identified: porcine 
kobuvirus, porcine sapelovirus, atypical porcine pestivirus and a novel 
Orthopneumovirus, provisionally named swine orthopneumovirus (SOV). SOV shared 
~90 % nucleotide identity to murine pneumonia virus (MPV) and canine 
pneumovirus. A modified, commercially available ELISA for MPV found that 
approximately 30 % of both feral and domestic swine sera were positive for 
antibodies cross-reactive with MPV. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR 
identified two (2 %) and four (5.0 %) positive nasal swab pools from feral and 
domestic swine, respectively, confirming that SOV circulates in both herds.

Bovine rotavirus B (RVB) is an etiological agent of diarrhea mostly in adult 
cattle. Currently, a few sequences of viral protein (VP)1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 and 
nonstructural protein (NSP)1, 2, and 5 of bovine RVB are available in the 
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases, and none have been reported for VP3, NSP3, and 
NSP4. In order to fill this gap in the genetic characterization of bovine RVB 
strains, we used a metagenomics approach and sequenced and analyzed the complete 
coding sequences (CDS) of VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 genes, as well as the partial or 
complete CDS of other genes of RVBs detected from Japanese cattle. VP3, NSP3, 
and NSP4 of bovine RVBs shared low nucleotide sequence identities (63.3-64.9% 
for VP3, 65.9-68.2% for NSP3, and 52.6-56.2% for NSP4) with those of murine, 
human, and porcine RVBs, suggesting that bovine RVBs belong to a novel genotype. 
Furthermore, significantly low amino acid sequence identities were observed for 
NSP4 (36.1-39.3%) between bovine RVBs and the RVBs of other species. In 
contrast, hydrophobic plot analysis of NSP4 revealed profiles similar to those 
of RVBs of other species and rotavirus A (RVA) strains. Phylogenetic analyses of 
all gene segments revealed that bovine RVB strains formed a cluster that 
branched distantly from other RVBs. These results suggest that bovine RVBs have 
evolved independently from other RVBs but in a similar manner to other 
rotaviruses. These findings provide insights into the evolution and diversity of 
RVB strains.

Porcine astroviruses (PoAstVs) are ubiquitous enteric virus of pigs that are 
distributed in several countries throughout the world. Since PoAstVs are 
detected in apparent healthy pigs, the clinical significance of infection is 
unknown. However, AstVs have recently been associated with a severe neurological 
disorder in animals, including humans, and zoonotic potential has been 
suggested. To date, little is known about the epidemiology of PoAstVs among the 
pig population in Japan. In this report, we present an analysis of nearly 
complete genomes of 36 PoAstVs detected by a metagenomics approach in the feces 
of Japanese pigs. Based on a phylogenetic analysis and pairwise sequence 
comparison, 10, 5, 15, and 6 sequences were classified as PoAstV2, PoAstV3, 
PoAstV4, and PoAstV5, respectively. Co-infection with two or three strains was 
found in individual fecal samples from eight pigs. The phylogenetic trees of 
ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 of PoAstV2 and PoAstV4 showed differences in their 
topologies. The PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains shared high sequence identities 
within each genotype in all ORFs; however, one PoAstV3 strain and one PoAstV5 
strain showed considerable sequence divergence from the other PoAstV3 and 
PoAstV5 strains, respectively, in ORF2. Recombination analysis using whole 
genomes revealed evidence of multiple possible intra-genotype recombination 
events in PoAstV2 and PoAstV4, suggesting that recombination might have 
contributed to the genetic diversity and played an important role in the 
evolution of Japanese PoAstVs.

Neonatal porcine diarrhoea of uncertain aetiology has been reported from a 
number of European countries. The aim of the present study was to use viral 
metagenomics to examine a potential viral involvement in this diarrhoea and to 
describe the intestinal virome with focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from 
the distal jejunum of 50 diarrhoeic and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected 
herds were analysed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic 
acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence independent 
amplification. Samples from diarrhoeic piglets from the same herds were pooled 
whereas samples from healthy piglets were analysed individually. In total, 29 
clinical samples, plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting 
of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The 
resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, 
Diamond and HMMER. In the healthy specimens, eight different mammalian virus 
families were detected (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, 
Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) 
compared to four in the pooled diarrhoeic samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, 
Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae). It was not possible to associate a particular 
virus family with the investigated diarrhoea. In conclusion, this study does not 
support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhoea was caused by known 
mammalian viruses. The results do, however, indicate that known mammalian 
viruses were present in the intestine as early as 24-48 hours after birth, 
indicating immediate infection post-partum or possibly transplacental infection.

Transmissible viral proventriculitis (TVP), an infectious disease in chickens, 
is responsible for economic losses in the commercial poultry industry. The major 
etiologic agent, however, is unknown. Using metagenomics, we compared the 
diversity of viruses present in proventriculus samples from flocks diagnosed 
with TVP to those of healthy flocks in South Korea between 2003 and 2012. Each 
sample had a mean of 21,538,726 sequence reads generated by high-throughput 
sequencing, with a mean length of 160 nt. Enrichment in viral sequences 
suggested that at least three viruses were present in each TVP sample. Although 
we could not determine a pathogen of TVP that matched the known morphology, 
picornavirus sequences were present in all five disease samples, suggesting an 
association with TVP. The five samples yielded 1,045-1,720 bp contigs with 81-84 
% nt sequence identity to turkey hepatitis virus (accession number: HM751199). 
Whole-genome analysis indicated that the QIA01 strain of the novel picornavirus 
was similar to turkey hepatitis virus in the P2 and P3 regions (82.7 % nt and 
95.5 % aa sequence identity), but different in the structural region and partial 
2A peptides (56.2 % nt and 23.9 % aa sequence identity). In addition, the QIA01 
virus was similar (87.0 % nt and 95.6 % aa sequence identity) to chicken 
megrivirus, recently detected in chickens with malabsorption syndrome in 
Hungary. Our results are useful for understanding the genetic diversity of avian 
picornaviruses and for classifying chicken megrivirus as a pathogen affecting 
the digestive tract of chickens.

A porcine enterovirus G associated with enteric disease contains a novel papain-like cysteine protease,"<jats:p>Identification of unknown pathogens in pigs displaying enteric illness is difficult due to the large diversity of bacterial and viral species found within faecal samples. Current methods often require bacterial or viral isolation, or testing only a limited number of known species using quantitative PCR analysis.

Sapoviruses (SaV) are enteric viruses infecting humans and animals. SaVs are 
highly diverse and are divided into multiple genogroups based on structural 
protein (VP1) sequences. SaVs detected from pigs belong to eight genogroups 
(GIII, GV, GVI, GVII, GVIII, GIX, GX, and GXI), but little is known about the 
SaV genogroup distribution in the Japanese pig population. In the present study, 
26 nearly complete genome (>6000 nucleotide: nt) and three partial sequences 
(2429nt, 4364nt, and 4419nt in length, including the entire VP1 coding region) 
of SaV were obtained from one diarrheic and 15 non-diarrheic porcine feces in 
Japan via a metagenomics approach. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP1 
amino acid sequence (aa) revealed that 29 porcine SaVs were classified into 
seven genogroups; GIII (11 strains), GV (1 strain), GVI (3 strains), GVII (6 
strains), GVIII (1 strain), GX (3 strains), and GXI (4 strains). This manuscript 
presents the first nearly complete genome sequences of GX and GXI, and 
demonstrates novel intergenogroup recombination events.

Diversity of viruses detected by deep sequencing in pigs from a common background,"<jats:p> Although advances in nucleic acid sequencing have enabled the discovery of many infectious agents, challenges remain for scientists and veterinary diagnosticians trying to design animal studies with a minimum of variables and to interpret laboratory results. To evaluate pyrosequencing technology as a potential screening method to estimate the virome in pigs, fecal samples were collected from 4 pigs out of a group of 175 that had been raised together since birth. A number of viruses were detected, demonstrating the application of this technology to determine the background “noise” in the pigs. However, pyrosequencing also demonstrated the diversity of viruses within a group of animals and how that can confound experimental design and obscure a definitive diagnosis. </jats:p>",1

Sapoviruses (SaVs), belonging to the genus Sapovirus of the family 
Caliciviridae, were known as the enteric pathogen causing acute gastroenteritis. 
SaVs have been detected in humans and several animals including pigs and some 
porcine SaVs showed close sequence relationship with human strains suggesting 
the possibility of interspecies transmission. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 
two porcine SaVs (with strain names of p38 and SH1703) using the metagenomic 
analyses and traditional RT-PCR methods. Phylogenetic trees were constructed 
based on the complete genome, the full-length VP 1 nucleotide and amino acid 
sequences to group those two strains. The two porcine SaV strains, p38 and 
SH1703, detected in this study, were classified as genogroup III and genogroup 
VII, respectively. These two strains showed similar genomic organization with 
that of other SaVs. We firstly divided SaVs into 51 genotypes within 19 
genogroups. Our data are helpful for genetic characterization and classification 
of newly detected SaVs worldwide.

Using viral metagenomics of brain tissue from a young adult crossbreed steer 
with acute onset of neurologic disease, we sequenced the complete genome of a 
novel astrovirus (BoAstV-NeuroS1) that was phylogenetically related to an ovine 
astrovirus. In a retrospective analysis of 32 cases of bovine encephalitides of 
unknown etiology, 3 other infected animals were detected by using PCR and in 
situ hybridization for viral RNA. Viral RNA was restricted to the nervous system 
and detected in the cytoplasm of affected neurons within the spinal cord, 
brainstem, and cerebellum. Microscopically, the lesions were of widespread 
neuronal necrosis, microgliosis, and perivascular cuffing preferentially 
distributed in gray matter and most severe in the cerebellum and brainstem, with 
increasing intensity caudally down the spinal cord. These results suggest that 
infection with BoAstV-NeuroS1 is a potential cause of neurologic disease in 
cattle.

This study is focused on the identification of the faecal virome of healthy 
chickens raised in high-density, export-driven poultry farms in Brazil. 
Following high-throughput sequencing, a total of 7743 de novo-assembled contigs 
were constructed and compared with known nucleotide/amino acid sequences from 
the GenBank database. Analyses with blastx revealed that 279 contigs (4 %) were 
related to sequences of eukaryotic viruses. Viral genome sequences (total or 
partial) indicative of members of recognized viral families, including 
Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, 
Picornaviridae and Reoviridae, were identified, some of those representing novel 
genotypes. In addition, a range of circular replication-associated protein 
encoding DNA viruses were also identified. The characterization of the faecal 
virome of healthy chickens described here not only provides a description of the 
viruses encountered in such niche but should also represent a baseline for 
future studies comparing viral populations in healthy and diseased chicken 
flocks. Moreover, it may also be relevant for human health, since chickens 
represent a significant proportion of the animal protein consumed worldwide.

Malabsorption syndrome (MAS) is an economically important disease of young, 
commercially reared broilers, characterized by growth retardation, defective 
feather development and diarrheic faeces. Several viruses have been tentatively 
associated to such syndrome. Here, in order to examine potential associations 
between enteric viruses and MAS, the faecal viromes of 70 stool samples 
collected from diseased (n = 35) and healthy (n = 35) chickens from seven flocks 
were characterized and compared. Following high-throughput sequencing, a total 
of 8,347,319 paired end reads, with an average of 231 nt, were generated. 
Through analysis of de novo assembled contigs, 144 contigs > 1000 nt were 
identified with hits to eukaryotic viral sequences, as determined by GenBank 
database. A number of known and unknown representatives of Adenoviridae, 
Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, 
Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae, as well as novel 
uncharacterized CRESS-DNA viruses, were identified. However, the distribution of 
sequence reads of viral genomes identified in diseased or healthy birds revealed 
no statistically significant differences. These findings indicate no association 
between the occurrence of MAS and enteric viruses. The viral genomes reported in 
the present study, including a variety of novel viruses, seem part of the normal 
intestinal microbiota of chickens.

Bufavirus is a single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the genus Protoparvovirus. 
This study reports the identification and characterization of a porcine 
bufavirus by a metagenomic approach, and a limited epidemiology investigation of 
bufavirus in six swine farms. A comparative genome analysis showed a similarity 
of 93 % to a Hungarian porcine bufavirus. Bayesian and maximum-likelihood 
analyses of genome sequences showed a close relationship of porcine bufaviruses 
to human and monkey bufaviruses. Molecular dating of the most recent common 
ancestors supported a recent introduction of bufaviruses into human and pig 
populations, respectively. A real-time PCR method was developed to screen 60 
faecal samples for the porcine bufavirus DNA, and eight positive samples were 
found in two neighbouring farms, suggesting a relatively low prevalence 
(13.3 %). No direct transmission of porcine bufaviruses between two neighbouring 
farms was found, suggesting that bufaviruses may have spread widely in different 
geographical regions.

BACKGROUND: Orf or contagious ecthyma is a zoonotic viral infection with a 
potential serious health threat for the small ruminants industry as well as 
humans. It is currently emerging in new territories.
RESULTS: Eight suspected clinical cases of pustular dermatitis in goats occurred 
in the rural area of Tebe, in south-eastern Gabon, in January 2013. The orf 
virus (ORFV) was detected by high-throughput sequencing on sera, buccal swabs 
and scab pool samples. It was confirmed in six out of eight sick goats by using 
specific PCR targeting the major envelope protein (B2L) and the orf virus 
interferon resistance (VIR) genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 
Gabonese strain and South Korean strains evolved from a common ancestor, 
suggesting an Asian origin of the ORFV' Gabonese strain.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the molecular detection of the ORFV strain 
involved in the cases of pustular dermatitis in goats and highlights its 
circulation in Gabon.

pig production in Uganda. This has resulted in increased contact between humans 
and pigs. Pigs can act as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore 
identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health 
surveillance. In this study, during a routine general surveillance for African 
swine fever, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and 
DNA viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method.
FINDINGS: Serum samples from 16 domestic pigs were collected from five regions 
in Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and 
sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among the sequences assigned to a taxon, 
53% mapped to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, Torque 
teno viruses (TTVs), and porcine endogenous retroviruses were identified. 
Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had sequences that showed 98% 
sequence identity to Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads had identity to the 
class Insecta indicating that these sequences were unlikely to result from 
contamination with mosquito nucleic acids.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host 
for Ndumu virus. NDUV had been previously isolated only from culicine 
mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a potential zoonotic pathogen, 
particularly given the increasing risk of human-livestock-mosquito contact.

There are few reports describing diarrhea of adult cattle caused by group A 
rotaviruses. Here, we report the identification of a novel bovine group A 
rotavirus from diarrhea of adult cows. A group A rotavirus was detected from an 
epizootic outbreak of diarrhea in adult cows with a decrease in milk production 
in Japan in 2013. The comprehensive genomic analyses from fecal samples by viral 
metagenomics using a next-generation sequencer revealed that it had an 
unreported genotype combination G15P[14]. The genome constellation of this 
strain, namely, RVA/Cow-wt/JPN/Tottori-SG/2013/G15P[14] was 
G15-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 representing 
VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5, respectively. Each gene 
segment of Tottori-SG was most closely related to Japanese bovine group A 
rotaviruses suggesting that Tottori-SG might have derived from multiple 
reassortment events from group A rotavirus strains circulating among Japanese 
cattle. No other diarrhea pathogen of adult cattle was detected by routine 
diagnosis and metagenomics. Viral metagenomics, using a next-generation 
sequencer, is useful to characterize group A rotaviruses from fecal samples and 
offers unbiased comprehensive investigations of pathogen.

A novel virus related to the Enterovirus/Sapelovirus supergroup in the family 
Picornaviridae was identified in healthy porcine feces in Japan by using a 
metagenomics approach. The genome of the virus, named Sapelo-like porcine 
picornavirus Japan (SPPVJ) Pig/Isi-Im1/JPN/2016, had a type-IV internal 
ribosomal entry site and carried a 6978-nucleotide-long single open reading 
frame encoding a 2326 amino acids (aa) polyprotein precursor. The coding 
sequence region consisted of leader protein (68 aa), a structural protein region 
P1 (824 aa), and the non-structural protein regions P2 (672 aa) and P3 (762 aa). 
Among representative picornaviruses, the P1, 2C, and 3CD regions of SPPVJ had 
the highest aa identities of 64.4%, 61.9%, and 73.3%, respectively, with the 
corresponding regions of sapelo-like bat picornavirus BtVs-PicoV/SC2013. 
Sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR products derived from the 5' untranslated and 
3D regions revealed the presence of SPPVJ in 17.8% (19/107) of the feces from 
healthy and diarrheal pigs in 12 farms in 2015-2016. Further studies are needed 
to determine the origin and pathogenic potential of SPPJV in pigs and other 
mammals.

The influenza D virus, a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, is 
predominantly found in cattle. Although viral pathology and clinical disease in 
cattle appear mild, this virus plays an important role as a trigger of bovine 
respiratory disease (BRD). BRD is a costly illness worldwide. Thus, 
epidemiological surveys of the influenza D virus are necessary. Here, we 
conducted a molecular epidemiological survey for the influenza D virus in 
healthy and respiratory-diseased cattle in Japan. We found that 2.1% (8/377) of 
the cattle were infected with influenza D. The cattle with and without 
respiratory symptoms had approximately equal amounts of the virus. A full-genome 
sequence analysis revealed that the influenza D virus that was isolated in Japan 
formed an individual cluster that was distinct from the strains found in other 
countries. These results suggest that this virus might have evolved uniquely in 
Japan over a long period of time and that the viral pathology of Japanese 
strains might be different from the strains found in other countries. Continuous 
surveillance is required to determine the importance of this virus and to 
characterize its evolution.

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most costly disease affecting the cattle 
industry. The pathogenesis of BRD is complex and includes contributions from 
microbial pathogens as well as host, environmental and animal management 
factors. In this study, we utilized viral metagenomic sequencing to explore the 
virome of nasal swab samples obtained from feedlot cattle with acute BRD and 
asymptomatic pen-mates at six and four feedlots in Mexico and the USA, 
respectively, in April-October 2015. Twenty-one viruses were detected, with 
bovine rhinitis A (52.7 %) and B (23.7 %) virus, and bovine coronavirus (24.7 %) 
being the most commonly identified. The emerging influenza D virus (IDV) tended 
to be significantly associated (P=0.134; odds ratio=2.94) with disease, whereas 
viruses commonly associated with BRD such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine 
herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza 3 
virus were detected less frequently. The detection of IDV was further confirmed 
using a real-time PCR assay. Nasal swabs from symptomatic animals had 
significantly more IDV RNA than those collected from healthy animals (P=0.04). 
In addition to known viruses, new genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus and 
enterovirus E were identified and a newly proposed species of bocaparvovirus, 
Ungulate bocaparvovirus 6, was characterized. Ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 was 
also detected for the first time in North America to our knowledge. These 
results illustrate the complexity of the virome associated with BRD and 
highlight the need for further research into the contribution of other viruses 
to BRD pathogenesis.

We identified novel viruses in feces from cattle with diarrhea collected in 2009 
in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, by using a metagenomics approach and determined 
the (near) complete sequences of the virus. Sequence analyses revealed that they 
had a standard picornavirus genome organization, i.e. 5' untranslated region 
(UTR) - L- P1 (VP4- VP3- VP2- VP1) - P2 (2A- 2B- 2C) - P3 (3A- 3B- 3C-3D) - 
3'UTR- poly(A). They are closely related to other unclassified Chinese 
picornaviruses; bat picornaviruses group 1-3, feline picornavirus, and canine 
picornavirus, sharing 45.4-51.4% (P1), 38.0-44.9% (P2), and 49.6-53.3% (P3) 
amino acid identities, respectively. The phylogenetic analyses and detailed 
genome characterization showed that they, together with the unclassified Chinese 
picornaviruses, grouped as a cluster for the P1, 2C, 3CD and VP1 coding regions. 
These viruses had conserved features (e.g. predicted protein cleavage sites, 
presence of a leader protein, 2A, 2C, 3C, and 3D functional domains), suggesting 
they have a common ancestor. Reverse-transcription-PCR assays, using specific 
primers designed from the 5'UTR sequence of these viruses, showed that 23.0% 
(20/87) of fecal samples from cattle with diarrhea were positive, indicating the 
prevalence of these picornavirus in the Japanese cattle population in Hokkaido 
Prefecture. However, further studies are needed to investigate the pathogenic 
potential and etiological role of these viruses in cattle.

A viral metagenomics approach was used to investigate fecal samples of Japanese 
calves with and without diarrhea. Of the different viral pathogens detected, 
read counts gave nearly complete astrovirus-related RNA sequences in 15 of the 
146 fecal samples collected in three distinct areas (Hokkaido, Ishikawa, and 
Kagoshima Prefectures) between 2009 and 2015. Due to the lack of genetic 
information about bovine astroviruses (BoAstVs) in Japan, these sequences were 
analyzed in this study. Nine of the 15 Japanese BoAstVs were closely related to 
Chinese BoAstVs and clustered into a lineage (tentatively named lineage 1) in 
all phylogenetic trees. Three of 15 strains were phylogenetically separate from 
lineage 1, showing low sequence identities, and clustered instead with an 
American strain isolated from cattle with respiratory disease (tentatively named 
lineage 2). Interestingly, two of 15 strains clustered with lineage 1 in the 
open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b regions, while they clustered with lineage 
2 in the ORF2 region. Remarkably, one of 15 strains exhibited low amino acid 
sequence similarity to other BoAstVs and was clustered separately with porcine 
astrovirus type 5 in all trees, and ovine astrovirus in the ORF2 region, 
suggesting past interspecies transmission.

This project sought to investigate the domestic caprid rumen virome by 
developing a robust viral DNA isolation and enrichment protocol (utilizing 
membrane filtration, ultra-centrifugation, overnight PEG treatment and nuclease 
treatment) and using RSD-PCR and high throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques. 
3.53% of the reads obtained were analogous to those of viruses denoting 
Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, Podoviridae, Mimiviridae, Microviridae, Poxviridae, 
Tectiviridae and Marseillevirus. Most of the sequenced reads from the rumen were 
similar to those of phages, which are critical in maintaining the rumen 
microbial populations under its carrying capacity. Though identified in the 
rumen, most of these viruses have been reported in other environments as well. 
Improvements in the viral DNA enrichment and isolation protocol are required to 
obtain data that are more representative of the rumen virome. The 102,130 
unknown reads (92.31%) for the goat and 36,241 unknown reads (93.86%) for the 
sheep obtained may represent novel genomes that need further study.

During an investigation of porcine fecal viruses using a metagenomics approach, 
a novel picornavirus was identified from the feces of a healthy two-month-old 
pig. This virus, named porcine picornavirus Japan (PPVJ), had a standard 
picornavirus genome organization, including the L protein region. The 5' 
untranslated region harbored a type II internal ribosomal entry site. This virus 
was most closely related to lesavirus 1 (amino acid sequence identity: 38.2 %) 
in P1, equine rhinitis A virus (25.8 %) in P2, and lesavirus 2 (40.9 %) in P3. 
According to the genus demarcations for the family Picornaviridae (less than 
40 %, 40 %, and 50 % amino acid sequence identity in P1, P2, and P3, 
respectively), PPVJ represents a new genus in the family Picornaviridae. PPVJ 
was detected in 23.3 % of the fecal samples (from 58.3 % of the farms across a 
wide area) from pigs less than four months old, by reverse transcription PCR, 
using specific primers designed from the 3D sequence, followed by sequencing. 
The host range and pathogenic potential of this virus in animals is yet to be 
determined.

A Metagenomics and Case-Control Study To Identify Viruses Associated with Bovine Respiratory Disease,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a common health problem for both dairy and beef cattle, resulting in significant economic loses. In order to identify viruses associated with BRD, we used a metagenomics approach to enrich and sequence viral nucleic acids in the nasal swabs of 50 young dairy cattle with symptoms of BRD. Following deep sequencing,
            <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>
            assembly, and translated protein sequence similarity searches, numerous known and previously uncharacterized viruses were identified. Bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine influenza D virus, bovine parvovirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 6, bovine rhinitis A virus, and multiple genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus were identified. The genomes of a previously uncharacterized astrovirus and picobirnaviruses were also partially or fully sequenced. Using real-time PCR, the rates of detection of the eight viruses that generated the most reads were compared for the nasal secretions of 50 animals with BRD versus 50 location-matched healthy control animals. Viruses were detected in 68% of BRD-affected animals versus 16% of healthy control animals. Thirty-eight percent of sick animals versus 8% of controls were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. Significantly associated with BRD were bovine adenovirus 3 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.005), and the recently described bovine influenza D virus (

            Bovine respiratory disease is the most economically important disease affecting the cattle industry, whose complex root causes include environmental, genetics, and infectious factors. Using an unbiased metagenomics approach, we characterized the viruses in respiratory secretions from BRD cases and identified known and previously uncharacterized viruses belonging to seven viral families. Using a case-control format with location-matched animals, we compared the rates of viral detection and identified 3 viruses associated with severe BRD signs. Combining a metagenomics and case-control format can provide candidate pathogens associated with complex infectious diseases and inform further studies aimed at reducing their impact.

Porcine Teschoviruses (PTVs) are associated with polioencephalomyelitis and 
various diseases, including reproductive and gastrointestinal disorders, of pigs 
and wild boars, and are also detected in the feces of healthy pigs. The genus 
Teschovirus contains a single species Teschovirus A that currently includes 13 
serotypes. In the present study, we identified novel PTVs that are distantly 
related to Teschovirus A and were found in fecal samples of pigs with or without 
diarrhea in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid (aa) sequences of the 
complete coding region revealed that these newly identified viruses did not 
cluster with any strains of PTVs or other strains within the picornavirus 
supergroup 1, suggesting that the viruses may not belong to Teschovirus A or any 
genus of the family Picornaviridae. These novel PTVs share a type IV internal 
ribosomal entry site and conserved characteristic motifs in the coding region, 
yet exhibit 62.2-79.0%, 86.6-92.8%, 77.1-81.0%, and 84.3-86.7% aa identities to 
PTV strains in P1, 2C, 3C, and 3D regions, respectively. In contrast, PTV 1-13 
strains of the Teschovirus A share 76.5-92.1%, 88.1-99.7%, 93.2-100%, and 
95.8-100% aa identities in the P1, 2C, 3C, and 3D, respectively, within the 
species. These data imply that the newly identified viruses belong to 
teschoviruses, and may represent a novel species in the genus Teschovirus.

Goat diarrheal feces were subjected to metagenome analysis by the 
next-generation sequencing. Nucleotide sequences with homology to enteroviruses 
were obtained. Primers for RT-PCR were designed based on the nucleotide sequence 
of these sequences at the 5'-untranslated region, and we determined 563 bp 
nucleotide sequences that showed homology to bovine-like and ovine enteroviruses 
(77-87 %). We named the virus detected in this study goat enterovirus G1 
(GEV-G1). In the phylogenetic analysis, GEV-G1 belonged to a cluster containing 
ovine enteroviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first report on nucleotide 
sequences of an enterovirus infecting Japanese goats.

Metagenomic sequencing of three nasal swabs collected from 10- to 21-day-old 
pigs exhibiting unexplained acute respiratory disease from two different 
commercial production facilities in Oklahoma identified a novel genotype of 
porcine astrovirus 4 (PAstV-4). The genomes had only ~75 % nucleotide sequence 
identity to previously characterized PAstV-4 isolates, while the capsid-encoding 
ORF2 had only ~53 % amino acid sequence identity to reference strains. A TaqMan 
assay targeting the novel ORF2 gene found 21 % and 19 % incidence in nasal and 
fecal swabs, respectively, submitted for unrelated diagnostic testing. PAstV-4 
RNA levels were significantly higher (P = 0.04) in nasal swabs, suggesting a 
possible atypical respiratory tropism.

A Novel Porcine Circovirus Distantly Related to Known Circoviruses Is Associated with Porcine Dermatitis and Nephropathy Syndrome and Reproductive Failure,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) is clinically manifested by postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), respiratory and enteric disease, reproductive failure, and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an essential component of PCVAD, although an etiologic role in PDNS is not well established. Here, a novel circovirus, designated porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3), was identified in sows that died acutely with PDNS-like clinical signs. The capsid and replicase proteins of PCV3 are only 37% and 55% identical to PCV2 and bat circoviruses, respectively. Aborted fetuses from sows with PDNS contained high levels of PCV3 (7.57 × 10
            <jats:sup>7</jats:sup>
            genome copies/ml), and no other viruses were detected by PCR and metagenomic sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of sow tissue samples identified PCV3 antigen in skin, kidney, lung, and lymph node samples localized in typical PDNS lesions, including necrotizing vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Further study of archived PDNS tissue samples that were negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis identified 45 of 48 that were PCV3 positive by quantitative PCR (qPCR), with 60% of a subset also testing positive for PCV3 by IHC analysis. Analysis by qPCR of 271 porcine respiratory disease diagnostic submission samples identified 34 PCV3-positive cases (12.5%), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of anti-PCV3 capsid antibodies in serum samples found that 46 (55%) of 83 samples tested were positive. These results suggest that PCV3 commonly circulates within U.S. swine and may play an etiologic role in reproductive failure and PDNS. Because of the high economic impact of PCV2, this novel circovirus warrants further studies to elucidate its significance and role in PCVAD.

            While porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) was first identified in sporadic cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in Canada in the early 1990s, an epidemic of severe systemic disease due to PCV2 spread worldwide in the ensuing decade. Despite being effectively controlled by commercial vaccines, PCV2 remains one of the most economically significant viruses of swine. Here, a novel porcine circovirus (PCV3) that is distantly related to known circoviruses was identified in sows with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) and reproductive failure. PCV2, which has previously been associated with these clinical presentations, was not identified. High levels of PCV3 nucleic acid were observed in aborted fetuses by quantitative PCR, and PCV3 antigen was localized in histologic lesions typical of PDNS in sows by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. PCV3 was also identified in archival PDNS diagnostic samples that previously tested negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis. The emergence of PCV3 warrants further investigation.

Parvoviruses are a diverse group of viruses containing some of the smallest 
known species that are capable of infecting a wide range of animals. Metagenomic 
sequencing of pooled rectal swabs from adult pigs identified a 4103-bp contig 
consisting of two major open reading frames encoding proteins of 672 and 469 
amino acids (aa) in length. BLASTP analysis of the 672-aa protein found 42.4 % 
identity to fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) parvovirus 2 (EhPV2) and 37.9 % to turkey 
parvovirus (TuPV) TP1-2012/HUN NS1 proteins. The 469-aa protein had no 
significant similarity to known proteins. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses 
suggest that PPV7, EhPV2, and TuPV represent a novel genus in the family 
Parvoviridae. Quantitative PCR screening of 182 porcine diagnostic samples found 
a total of 16 positives (8.6 %). Together, these data suggest that PPV7 is a 
highly divergent novel parvovirus prevalent within the US swine.

Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) are bisegmented viruses with a wide geographical and 
host species distribution. The number of novel PBV sequences has been increasing 
with the help of the viral metagenomics. A novel picobirnavirus strain, 
pbv/CHK/M3841/HUN/2011, was identified by viral metagenomics; the complete 
segment 1 (MH327933) and 2 (MH327934) sequences were obtained by RT-PCR from a 
cloacal sample of a diseased broiler breeder pullet in Hungary. Although the 
conserved nucleotide (e.g., ribosome binding site) and amino acid motifs (e.g., 
ExxRxNxxxE, S-domain of the viral capsid and motifs in the RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase) were identifiable in the chicken picobirnavirus genome, the putative 
segment 1 showed low (< 30%) amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding 
proteins of marmot and dromedary PBVs, while segment 2 showed higher (< 70%) 
amino acid sequence identity to a wolf PBV protein sequence. This is the first 
full-genome picobirnavirus sequence from a broiler breeder chicken, but the 
pathogenicity of this virus is still questionable.

In June 2013, a 4-year-old Welsh Mountain ewe and in March 2014 a 10-day-old 
lamb of the same breed and the same flock presented progressive neurological 
signs including depressed sensorium, tremor, and unusual behaviour. 
Neuropathological examination of the brain and spinal cord detected 
non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis and dorsal root ganglionitis, 
characteristic of a neurotropic viral agent in both sheep. Metagenomic analysis 
of different tissue samples from both animals identified a novel Ovine 
Astrovirus (OvAstV). The presence of viral genome in the central nervous system 
was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Although the cases presented nine months apart, the 
identified OvAstV shared nearly identical sequences, differing in only three 
nucleotide positions across the complete genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
a close relation of OvAstV to neurotropic bovine astroviruses and an enteric 
OvAstV. In conclusion, these are the first reported cases of astrovirus 
infection in domestic sheep that were associated with encephalitis and 
ganglionitis.

BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus 2 causes different clinical syndromes resulting 
in a significant economic loss in the pork industry. Three pigs with unexplained 
cardiac and multi-organ inflammation that tested negative for PCV2 and other 
known porcine pathogens were further analyzed.
METHODS: Histology was used to identify microscopic lesions in multiple tissues. 
Metagenomics was used to detect viral sequences in tissue homogenates. In situ 
hybridization was used to detect viral RNA expression in cardiac tissue.
RESULTS: In all three cases we characterized the genome of a new circovirus we 
called PCV3 with a replicase and capsid proteins showing 55 and 35 % identities 
to the genetically-closest proteins from a bat-feces associated circovirus and 
were even more distant to those of porcine circovirus 1 and 2. Common 
microscopic lesions included non-suppurative myocarditis and/or cardiac 
arteriolitis. Viral mRNA was detected intralesionally in cardiac cells. Deep 
sequencing in tissues also revealed the presence of porcine astrovirus 4 in all 
three animals as well as rotavirus A, porcine cytomegalovirus and porcine 
hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus in individual cases.
CONCLUSION: The pathogenicity and molecular epidemiology of this new circovirus, 
alone or in the context of co-infections, warrants further investigations.

PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque teno sus virus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC.

Virome (viral megagenomics) detection using next generation sequencing has been 
widely applied in virology, but its methods remain complicated and need 
optimization. In this study, we detected the viromes of RNA viruses of one mock 
sample, one pooled duck feces sample and one pooled mink feces sample on the 
Personal Genome Machine platform using the sequencing libraries prepared by 
three methods. The sequencing primers were added through random hybridization 
and ligation to fragmented viral RNA using a RNA-Seq kit in method 1, through 
random reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in method 
2 which was developed in our laboratory, and through hybridization and ligation 
to fragmented amplicons of random RT-PCR using a single primer in method 3. 
Although the results of these three samples (nine libraries) all showed that 
more classified viral families and genera were identified using methods 2 and 3 
than using method 1, and more classified viral families and genera were 
identified using method 2 than using method 3, most of the differences were of 
no statistical significance. Moreover, 11 mammalian viral genera in minks were 
possibly identified for the first time through this study.

The family Astroviridae consists of two genera, Avastrovirus and Mamastrovirus, 
whose members are associated with gastroenteritis in avian and mammalian hosts, 
respectively. We serendipitously identified a novel ovine astrovirus in a fecal 
specimen from a domestic sheep (Ovis aries) in Hungary by viral metagenomic 
analysis. Sequencing of the fragment indicated that it was an ORF1b/ORF2/3'UTR 
sequence, and it has been submitted to the GenBank database as ovine astrovirus 
type 2 (OAstV-2/Hungary/2009) with accession number JN592482. The unique 
sequence characteristics and the phylogenetic position of OAstV-2 suggest that 
genetically divergent lineages of astroviruses exist in sheep.

BACKGROUND: The pig faecal virome, which comprises the community of viruses 
present in pig faeces, is complex and consists of pig viruses, bacteriophages, 
transiently passaged plant viruses and other minor virus species. Only little is 
known about factors influencing its general composition. Here, the effect of the 
probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the pig 
faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and 
their piglets, which received either the probiotic bacterium or not.
RESULTS: From 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial, DNA and 
RNA virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled Next 
Generation Sequencing resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. In average, 14% of 
the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses. The 
percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest (55-77%) in the 
samples of the youngest piglets and lowest (8-10%) in the samples of the sows. 
In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22-44% in 
the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows. The dominating mammalian 
viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets (kobuvirus), 54 day-old 
piglets (boca-, dependo- and pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus 
[PigSCV]) and the sows (PigSCV, circovirus and ""circovirus-like"" viruses CB-A 
and RW-A). In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of 
sequences present in a sample, was generally higher for the sows as compared to 
the piglets. No consistent differences in the virome composition could be 
identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the 
control group.
CONCLUSION: The analysis indicates that the pig faecal virome shows a high 
variability and that its general composition is mainly dependent on the age of 
the pigs. Changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium E. faecium 
could not be demonstrated using the applied metagenomics method.

Using viral metagenomics we analyzed four bovine serum pools assembled from 715 
calves in the United States. Two parvoviruses, bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) and a 
previously uncharacterized parvovirus designated as bosavirus (BosaV), were 
detected in 3 and 4 pools respectively and their complete coding sequences 
generated. Based on NS1 protein identity, bosavirus qualifies as a member of a 
new species in the copiparvovirus genus. Also detected were low number of reads 
matching ungulate tetraparvovirus 2, bovine hepacivirus, and several 
papillomaviruses. This study further characterizes the diversity of viruses in 
calf serum with the potential to infect fetuses and through fetal bovine serum 
contaminate cell cultures.

BACKGROUND: Currently, eight species in four genera of parvovirus have been 
described that infect swine. These include ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (classical 
porcine parvovirus, PPV), ungulate tetraparvovirus 2 (PPV3), ungulate 
tetraparvovirus 3 (which includes PPV2, porcine hokovirus, porcine partetravirus 
and porcine PARV4), ungulate copiparvovirus 2 (which includes PPV4 and PPV5), 
ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (which includes porcine bocavirus 1, 2 and 6), 
ungulate bocaparvovirus 3 (porcine bocavirus 5), ungulate bocaparvovirus 4 
(porcine bocavirus 7) and ungulate bocaparvovirus 5 (porcine bocavirus 3, 4-1 
and 4-2). PPV6, the most recently described porcine parvovirus, was first 
identified in China in late 2014 in aborted pig fetuses. Prevalence of PPV6 in 
China was found to be similar in finishing age pigs from farms with and without 
evidence of swine reproductive failure.
METHODS: Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) was detected by sequence-independent single 
primer amplification (SISPA) and confirmed by overlapping and real-time PCR in 
the serum of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSv) positive 
samples.
RESULTS: Seven nearly complete genomes of PPV6 were identified in PRRSv genotype 
2 positive serum samples submitted to state veterinary diagnostic laboratories 
in 2014. Further testing using overlapping and real-time PCR determined PPV6 to 
be present in 13.2 % of the serums tested. Additionally, PPV6 was present in 
samples from all of the geographic locations sampled encompassing nine states in 
the United States and one state in Mexico. The presence of PPV6 in serum 
indicates that the PPV6 infection is disseminated and not localized to a 
specific tissue type. Alignments of the near full length genomes, NS1, and 
capsid genes identified one of the five PPV6 isolates from China (98.6-99.5 % 
identity with the North American strains) to be the North American strains 
nearest relative.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to report the presence of PPV6 in North 
America and demonstrate that the virus is found in multiple geographic areas in 
the United States and in Mexico. The overall prevalence of PPV6 in PRRSv viremic 
animals is relatively low. Further, all of the PPV6 genomes found in North 
America are most closely related to a PPV6 strain first identified in 2014 in 
healthy pigs from the Tianjin province of China.

Encephalitis can be caused by several infectious agents, including bacteria, 
fungi, parasites and viruses. In many cases, the causative agent cannot be 
identified, because the pathogens are unknown or detection methods are not 
routinely available. In our case, a 15-month-old cow developed central nervous 
disorders and died within 6 days after the onset of clinical signs. The 
histopathology revealed an acute encephalitis, predominantly in the brain stem, 
and a ganglionitis of the trigeminal ganglion with massive neuronal necroses in 
both the brain and the ganglion. However, a relevant panel of bacterial and 
viral infections of cattle could be routinely excluded. Therefore, a brain 
sample from the cow was analysed using a metagenomics approach with 
next-generation sequencing. A novel bovine astrovirus (BoAstV-BH89/14) could be 
identified using the analysis pipeline RIEMS, and the finding could be confirmed 
with a specific BoAstV RT-qPCR. The genome of the bovine astrovirus (BoAstV), 
belonging to the family Astroviridae in the genus Mamastrovirus, has a length of 
6478 bp. Sequence identities between 71% to a sheep astrovirus and 69% to two 
recently described bovine astroviruses from the USA and Switzerland were 
ascertained. The latter were also connected to encephalitis cases in cattle. 
Like these, the new virus described here was detected in different brain 
sections using the specific BoAstV RT-qPCR and fluorescent in situ 
hybridization. In conclusion, while astroviruses so far were mainly found in 
relation to gastroenteritis in animals and humans, recently detected astrovirus 
infections were also related to encephalitis.

RNA viruses have been associated with enteritis in poultry and have been 
isolated from diseased birds. The same viral agents have also been detected in 
healthy flocks bringing into question their role in health and disease. In order 
to understand better eukaryotic viruses in the gut, this project focused on 
evaluating alternative methods to purify and concentrate viral particles, which 
do not involve the use of density gradients, for generating viral metagenome 
data. In this study, the sequence outcomes of three tissue processing methods 
have been evaluated and a data analysis pipeline has been established for RNA 
viruses from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, with the use of the best 
method and increased sequencing depth, a glimpse of the RNA viral community in 
the gastrointestinal tract of a clinically normal 5-week old turkey is 
presented. The viruses from the Reoviridae and Astroviridae families together 
accounted for 76.3% of total viruses identified. The rarefaction curve at the 
species level further indicated that majority of the species diversity was 
included with the increased sequencing depth, implying that viruses from other 
viral families were present in very low abundance.

The Fecal Virome of Pigs on a High-Density Farm,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Swine are an important source of proteins worldwide but are subject to frequent viral outbreaks and numerous infections capable of infecting humans. Modern farming conditions may also increase viral transmission and potential zoonotic spread. We describe here the metagenomics-derived virome in the feces of 24 healthy and 12 diarrheic piglets on a high-density farm. An average of 4.2 different mammalian viruses were shed by healthy piglets, reflecting a high level of asymptomatic infections. Diarrheic pigs shed an average of 5.4 different mammalian viruses. Ninety-nine percent of the viral sequences were related to the RNA virus families<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Picornaviridae</jats:named-content>,<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Astroviridae</jats:named-content>,<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Coronaviridae</jats:named-content>, and<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Caliciviridae</jats:named-content>, while 1% were related to the small DNA virus families<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Circoviridae</jats:named-content>,<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">and Parvoviridae.</jats:named-content>Porcine RNA viruses identified, in order of decreasing number of sequence reads, consisted of kobuviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and teschoviruses. The near-full genomes of multiple novel species of porcine astroviruses and bocaviruses were generated and phylogenetically analyzed. Multiple small circular DNA genomes encoding replicase proteins plus two highly divergent members of the<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Picornavirales</jats:named-content>order were also characterized. The possible origin of these viral genomes from pig-infecting protozoans and nematodes, based on closest sequence similarities, is discussed. In summary, an unbiased survey of viruses in the feces of intensely farmed animals revealed frequent coinfections with a highly diverse set of viruses providing favorable conditions for viral recombination. Viral surveys of animals can readily document the circulation of known and new viruses, facilitating the detection of emerging viruses and prospective evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials.</jats:p>",1

In recent years, innovations in molecular techniques and sequencing technologies 
have resulted in a rapid expansion in the number of known viral sequences, in 
particular those with circular replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding 
single-stranded (CRESS) DNA genomes. CRESS DNA viruses are present in the virome 
of many ecosystems and are known to infect a wide range of organisms. A large 
number of the recently identified CRESS DNA viruses cannot be classified into 
any known viral families, indicating that the current view of CRESS DNA viral 
sequence space is greatly underestimated. Animal faecal matter has proven to be 
a particularly useful source for sampling CRESS DNA viruses in an ecosystem, as 
it is cost-effective and non-invasive. In this study a viral metagenomic 
approach was used to explore the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses present in the 
faeces of domesticated and wild animals in New Zealand. Thirty-eight complete 
CRESS DNA viral genomes and two circular molecules (that may be defective 
molecules or single components of multicomponent genomes) were identified from 
forty-nine individual animal faecal samples. Based on shared genome 
organisations and sequence similarities, eighteen of the isolates were 
classified as gemycircularviruses and twelve isolates were classified as 
smacoviruses. The remaining eight isolates lack significant sequence similarity 
with any members of known CRESS DNA virus groups. This research adds 
significantly to our knowledge of CRESS DNA viral diversity in New Zealand, 
emphasising the prevalence of CRESS DNA viruses in nature, and reinforcing the 
suggestion that a large proportion of CRESS DNA viruses are yet to be 
identified.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are becoming increasingly 
accessible, leading to an expanded interest in the composition of the porcine 
enteric virome. In the present study, the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic 
Belgian piglet was determined. Although the virome of only a single piglet was 
analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete 
genome of a pig group C rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly 
related to the only other completely characterized pig RVC strain, Cowden. Its 
relatedness to RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed and the 
porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in 
humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the 
rare porcine G3 genotype, which might be serologically distinct from most other 
pig RVC strains. A putative novel RVC VP6 genotype was identified as well. A 
group A rotavirus strain also present in this fecal sample contained the rare 
pig genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical 
pig RVA genotypes I5, A8, and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1, 
and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the fecal virome of the piglet also 
contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, of which the complete genomes were 
characterized. Results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be 
present simultaneously in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets. In this study, 
these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease, but still they 
might have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance. The 
fast evolution of NGS will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in 
veterinary practice. Its application will certainly lead to better insights into 
the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections, that may have 
remained unnoticed using traditional diagnostic techniques. This will stimulate 
the development of new and durable prophylactic measures to improve pig health 
and production.

Nanopore sequencing as a revolutionary diagnostic tool for porcine viral enteric disease complexes identifies porcine kobuvirus as an important enteric virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Enteric diseases in swine are often caused by different pathogens and thus metagenomics are a useful tool for diagnostics. The capacities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics were investigated here. First, cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were already detected at 7 seconds after start of sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3 h. Next, diarrheic feces of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed. Almost all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages, which may have reshaped the piglet’s microbiome. Contigs matched <jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Escherichia</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Enterococcus</jats:italic> phages. Moreover, porcine kobuvirus was discovered in the feces for the first time in Belgium. Suckling piglets shed kobuvirus from one week of age, but an association between peak of viral shedding (10<jats:sup>6.42</jats:sup>–10<jats:sup>7.01</jats:sup> copies/swab) and diarrheic signs was not observed during a follow-up study. Retrospective analysis showed the widespread (n = 25, 56.8% positive) of genetically moderately related kobuviruses among Belgian diarrheic piglets. MinION enables rapid detection of enteric viruses. Such new methodologies will change diagnostics, but more extensive validations should be conducted. The true enteric pathogenicity of porcine kobuvirus should be questioned, while its subclinical importance cannot be excluded.</jats:p>",1

Two full-genome sequences of porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) are reported. The 
genomes were recovered from pooled serum samples from sows who had just 
delivered litters with variable numbers of stillbirths. The two circular genomes 
(PCV3-BR/RS/6 and PCV3-BR/RS/8) are 2,000 nucleotides long and contain two open 
reading frames (ORFs) oriented in opposite directions that encode the putative 
capsid (Cap) and replicase (Rep) proteins. The intergenic region contains a 
stem-loop motif, as reported for other circoviruses. Rolling circle replication 
motifs and putative helicase domains were identified in the Rep coding region. 
The degree of overall nucleotide similarity between the genomes reported here 
and those available at GenBank was higher than 97%. No PCV3 sequence was 
detected in pooled serum samples from sows which had no stillbirths on the same 
farms. However, further studies are necessary to confirm the association between 
PCV3 and the occurrence of stillbirths.

The family Coronaviridae represents a diverse group of vertebrate RNA viruses, 
all with genomes greater than 26,000 nt. Here, we report the discovery and 
genetic characterization of a novel virus present in cattle with respiratory 
disease. Phylogenetic characterization of this virus revealed that it clusters 
within the subfamily Torovirinae, in the family Coronaviridae. The complete 
genome consists of only 20,261 nt and represents the smallest reported 
coronavirus genome. We identified seven ORFs, including the canonical nidovirus 
ORF1a and ORF1b. Analysis of polyprotein 1ab revealed that this virus, 
tentatively named bovine nidovirus (BoNV), shares the highest homology with the 
recently described python-borne nidoviruses and contains several conserved 
nidovirus motifs, but does not encode the NendoU or O-MT domains that are 
present in other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. In concert with its 
reduced genome, the atypical domain architecture indicates that this virus 
represents a unique lineage within the order Nidovirales.

To study the genetic diversity of enterovirus G (EV-G) among Japanese pigs, 
metagenomics sequencing was performed on fecal samples from pigs with or without 
diarrhea, collected between 2014 and 2016. Fifty-nine EV-G sequences, which were 
>5,000 nucleotides long, were obtained. By complete VP1 sequence analysis, 
Japanese EV-G isolates were classified into G1 (17 strains), G2 (four strains), 
G3 (22 strains), G4 (two strains), G6 (two strains), G9 (six strains), G10 (five 
strains), and a new genotype (one strain). Remarkably, 16 G1 and one G2 strain 
identified in diarrheic (23.5%; four strains) or normal (76.5%; 13 strains) 
fecal samples possessed a papain-like cysteine protease (PL-CP) sequence, which 
was recently found in the USA and Belgium in the EV-G genome, at the 2C-3A 
junction site. This paper presents the first report of the high prevalence of 
viruses carrying PL-CP in the EV-G population. Furthermore, possible inter- and 
intragenotype recombination events were found among EV-G strains, including 
G1-PL-CP strains. Our findings may advance the understanding of the molecular 
epidemiology and genetic evolution of EV-Gs.

BACKGROUND: Free-range cattle are common in the Northeast China area, which have 
close contact with farmers and may carry virus threatening to cattle and 
farmers.
METHODS: Using viral metagenomics we analyzed the virome in plasma samples 
collected from 80 cattle from the forested region of Northeast China.
RESULTS: The virome of cattle plasma is composed of the viruses belonging to the 
families including Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and 
divergent viral genomes showing sequence similarity to circular Rep-encoding 
single stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses. Five such CRESS-DNA genomes were full 
characterized, with Rep sequences related to circovirus and gemycircularvirus. 
Three bovine parvoviruses belonging to two different genera were also 
characterized.
CONCLUSION: The virome in plasma samples of cattle from the forested region of 
Northeast China was revealed, which further characterized the diversity of 
viruses in cattle plasma.

Recombination occurs frequently between enteroviruses (EVs) which are classified 
within the same species of the Picornaviridae family. Here, using viral 
metagenomics, the genomes of two recombinant EV-Gs (strains EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014 
and EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014) found in the feces of pigs from a swine farm in China 
are described. The two strains are characterized by distinct insertion of a 
papain-like protease gene from toroviruses classified within the Coronaviridae 
family. According to recent reports the site of the torovirus protease insertion 
was located at the 2C/3A junction region in EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014. For the other 
variant EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014, the inserted protease sequence replaced the entire 
viral capsid protein region up to the VP1/2A junction. These two EV-G strains 
were highly prevalent in the same pig farm with all animals shedding the 
full-length genome (EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014) while 65% also shed the capsid deletion 
mutant (EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014). A helper-defective virus relationship between the 
two co-circulating EV-G recombinants is hypothesized.

Non-suppurative encephalitis is one of the most frequent pathological diagnosis 
in cattle with neurological disease, but there is a gap in the knowledge on 
disease-associated pathogens. In order to identify viruses that are associated 
with non-suppurative encephalitis in cattle, we used a viral metagenomics 
approach on a sample set of 16 neurologically-diseased cows. We detected six 
virus candidates: parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV-5), bovine astrovirus CH13/NeuroS1 
(BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1), bovine polyomavirus 2 (BPyV-2 SF), ovine herpesvirus 2 
(OvHV-2), bovine herpesvirus 6 (BHV-6) and a novel bovine betaretrovirus termed 
BoRV-CH15. In a case-control study using PCR, BoAstV-CH13 (p=0.046), BoPV-2 SF 
(p=0.005) and BoHV-6 (p=4.3E-05) were statistically associated with the disease. 
These data expand our knowledge on encephalitis-associated pathogens in cattle 
and point to the value of NGS in resolving complex infection scenarios in a 
clinical disease setting.

Ticks are medically-important arthropods that maintain and transmit numerous 
emerging viruses. China suffers severely from tick-borne viral diseases such as 
tick-borne encephalitis and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), 
but the background of tick-borne viruses is very limited. Here we report the 
virome profiling of ticks and goat sera from SFTS-epidemic areas, and 
serological investigation of SFTS virus (SFTSV) and Nairobi sheep disease virus 
(NSDV). Results revealed divergent viruses in ticks and goat sera, including 
SFTSV and NSDV. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the SFTSV 
identified here was most closely related to human SFTSV in sampling and 
surrounding areas, and the NSDV to the previously identified NSDV from northeast 
China. Serological investigation of SFTSV infection in goats revealed intensive 
activity in those areas. Surprisingly, two different methods of NSDV serological 
investigation showed no sera positive for this virus.

Using a high-throughput DNA sequencing method, one DNA sequence (contig01006), 
suspected to belong to a novel porcine bocavirus (PBoV), was found with a high 
rate of detection (19.6 %) in fecal samples from healthy piglets. Moreover, a 
novel PBoV (tentatively named PBoV3C) with a nearly complete genome sequence 
(5235 bp) was identified. PBoV3C exhibits typical genome characteristics of 
bocaviruses and shows the highest genomic sequence identity (78 % to 81 %) to 
PBoV3A/B (PBoV3/4-UK) and PBoV3D/E (PBoV3/4-HK), respectively. Phylogenetic and 
recombination analysis indicated high diversity, prevalence and complexity among 
the PBoVs. The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) site of VP1 and the secondary structure 
of VP2 of PBoV3C were also analyzed. Additionally, we propose a uniform method 
of PBoV nomenclature based on the VP1 gene.

Influenza H7N9 and H9N2 Viruses: Coexistence in Poultry Linked to Human H7N9 Infection and Genome Characteristics,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Avian influenza virus A of the novel H7N9 reassortant subtype was recently found to cause severe human respiratory infections in China. Live poultry markets were suspected locations of the human H7N9 infection sources, based on the cases' exposure histories and sequence similarities between viral isolates. To explore the role of live poultry markets in the origin of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental specimens from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as well as high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified specimens positive for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all of the 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks, and environmental specimens from the markets contained heavily mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2 and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea of the coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, human H7N9 infection cases (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 31) were all negative for H9N2 virus according to real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2, and internal-segment sequences were very close to the sequence of the H9N2 virus circulating in chickens in China recently. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains coexisted with the novel human-pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically linked live poultry markets. Avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus and continues to do so.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Our results suggest that avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus, a novel reassortant avian influenza virus A subtype, and continues to do so. The finding helps shed light on how the H7N9 virus emerged, spread, and transmitted to humans. It is of considerable interest for assessing the risk of the possible emergence of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced transmissibility to humans.

Viral metagenomics analysis demonstrates the diversity of viral flora in piglet diarrhoeic faeces in China,"<jats:p>To investigate the diversity of viral flora, we used metagenomics to study the viral communities in a pooled faecal sample of 27 diarrhoeic piglets from intensive commercial farms in China. The 15 distinct mammalian viruses identified in the pooled diarrhoeic sample were, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, <jats:italic>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</jats:italic> (PEDV), sapovirus, porcine bocavirus-4 (PBoV-4), sapelovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, PBoV-2, stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus (poSCV), astrovirus (AstV), kobuvirus, posavirus-1, porcine enterovirus-9 (PEV-9), porcine circovirus-like (po-circo-like) virus, picobirnavirus (PBV) and <jats:italic>Torque teno sus virus 2</jats:italic> (TTSuV-2). The prevalence rate of each virus was verified from diarrhoeic and healthy piglets by PCR assay. A mean of 5.5 different viruses were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact co-infected with 11 different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets. Furthermore, we report here for the first time the presence of several recently described viruses in China, and the identification of novel genotypes. Therefore, our investigation results provide an unbiased survey of viral communities and prevalence in faecal samples of piglets.</jats:p>",1
High-throughput whole genome sequencing of <i>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus</i> from cell culture materials and clinical specimens using next-generation sequencing technology,"<jats:p> Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have increasingly played crucial roles in biological and medical research, but are not yet in routine use in veterinary diagnostic laboratories. We developed and applied a procedure for high-throughput RNA sequencing of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from cell culture–derived isolates and clinical specimens. Ten PRRSV isolates with known sequence information, 2 mixtures each with 2 different PRRSV isolates, and 51 clinical specimens (19 sera, 16 lungs, and 16 oral fluids) with various PCR threshold cycle (Ct) values were subjected to nucleic acid extraction, cDNA library preparation (24-plexed), and sequencing. Whole genome sequences were obtained from 10 reference isolates with expected sequences and from sera with a PRRSV real-time reverse transcription PCR Ct ≤ 23.6, lung tissues with Ct ≤ 21, and oral fluids with Ct ≤ 20.6. For mixtures with PRRSV-1 and -2 isolates (57.8% nucleotide identity), NGS was able to distinguish them as well as obtain their respective genome sequences. For mixtures with 2 PRRSV-2 isolates (92.4% nucleotide identity), sequence reads with nucleotide ambiguity at numerous sites were observed, indicating mixed infection; however, individual virus sequences could only be separated when 1 isolate identity and sequence in the mixture is known. The NGS approach described herein offers the prospect of high-throughput sequencing and could be adapted to routine workflows in veterinary diagnostic laboratories, although further improvement of sequencing outcomes from clinical specimens with higher Ct values remains to be investigated. </jats:p>",1

Ducks play an important role in transmitting and maintaining mammalian viruses 
in nature, and are a reservoir host of many animal viruses. We analyzed the 
fecal virome of four strains (A, B, C, and D) of ducks living in isolation by 
using metagenomic analysis. The feces of the ducks tested contained 18 animal 
virus families. The percentage values of RNA virus reads, compared to the total 
animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% (A), 97.30% (B), 
98.01 (C), and 67.49% (D), and were mainly from Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, 
Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Reoviridae. Meanwhile, the minority of DNA 
virus reads were related to Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Iridoviridae, and 
other, low abundance viral families. The percentage values of Orthomyxoviridae, 
Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Herpesviridae reads were not 
significantly different among strains A, B, and C; however, there were marked 
differences in the abundance of these reads in strain D. In summary, this study 
provides an unbiased examination of the viral diversity in the feces of four 
strains of ducks in specific-pathogen-free periods, and highlights the variation 
in the percentage of viral families present. These results can be used as a 
reference for detecting duck viral pathogens and predicting zoonotic potential.

Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) was detected in Shandong, China. One hundred 
and thirty-two of 222 (59.46%) samples were PCV3 positive, while 52 of 132 
(39.39%) samples were co-infected with PCV2. There were no clinical signs of 
infection in either multiparous sows or live-born infants. Two strains of PCV3 
were indentified from natural stillborn foetuses. Phylogenetic analysis showed 
the two strains of PCV3 are 96% identical to the known PCV3/Pig/USA (KX778720.1, 
KX966193.1 and KX898030.1) and closely related to Barbel Circovirus. Further 
studies of the epidemiology of PCV3 and the co-infection with PCV2 are needed.

Recommendations for a Standardized Avian Coronavirus (AvCoV) Nomenclature: 
Outcome from Discussions Within the Framework of the European Union COST Action 
FA1207: ""Towards Control of Avian Coronaviruses: Strategies for Vaccination, 
Diagnosis and Surveillance"".

European Union COST Action FA1207.

Viruses within the Coronaviridae family show variations within their genome 
sequences, especially within the major structural protein, the Spike (S) 
glycoprotein gene. Therefore, many different antigenic forms, serotypes, or 
variant strains of avian coronaviruses (AvCoV) exist worldwide. Only a few of 
them, the so called protectotypes, cross protect against different serotypes. 
New serotypes arise by recombination or spontaneous mutations. From time to 
time, antigenic virus variants appear which differ significantly from known 
serotypes. The result of this variability is an inconsistent nomenclature and 
classification of virus strains. Furthermore, there are currently no standard 
classification methods defined. Within the framework of the COST Action FA1207 
""Towards control of avian coronaviruses: strategies for diagnosis, surveillance, 
and vaccination"" (working groups ""Molecular virology"" and ""Epidemiology""), we 
aimed at defining and developing a unified and internationally standardized 
nomenclature and classification of AvCoVs. We recommend the use of ""CoV 
Genus/AvCov/host/country/specimen id/year"" to refer to AvCoV strains.

The present study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics of 
circulating infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains in vaccinated broiler 
flocks in the Giza and Fayoum governorates. Thirty-four isolates were collected, 
and egg propagation revealed their ability to induce typical IBV lesions after 
three to five successive passages. Three selected isolates were identified as 
IBV using a real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay targeted the nucleocapsid 
(N) gene and further characterized by partial spike (S) gene sequence analysis. 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed their clustering into two variant groups. Group I 
consisted of one variant (VSVRI_F3), which had 99.1% nucleotide sequence 
identity to the Q1 reference strain. Group II consisted of variants VSVRI_G4 and 
VSVRI_G9, which showed 92.8%-94.3% nucleotide identity with the Egyptian 
variants Eg/12120S/2012, Eg/12197B/2012, and Eg/1265B/2012. Regarding the 
deduced amino acid sequence, the three variants had 77.1%-85.2% similarity with 
the vaccine strains currently used in Egypt. These findings highlight the 
importance of monitoring the prevalence of IBV variants in vaccinated broiler 
flocks as well as adopting an appropriate vaccination strategy.

A novel sapelovirus-like virus was isolated from a wild boar (Sus scrofa). In 
this study, partial viral genomic nucleotide sequences were determined using the 
rapid determination system of viral nucleic acid sequences (RDV) ver. 3.1, which 
we recently developed for discovering novel viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of 
VP1 and 3A proteins and their encoding nucleotide sequences of enteroviruses and 
sapeloviruses indicated that the isolated virus was closely related to porcine 
sapelovirus. RT-PCR detected viral sequences in six of 48 wild boar fecal 
samples.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gammacoronavirus that causes a highly 
contagious respiratory disease in chickens. A QX-like strain was analysed by 
high-throughput Illumina sequencing and genetic variation across the entire 
viral genome was explored at the sub-consensus level by single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) in the order 
5'-UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'UTR were predicted. The relative 
frequencies of missense: silent SNPs were calculated to obtain a comparative 
measure of variability in specific genes. The most variable ORFs in descending 
order were E, 3b, 5'UTR, N, 1a, S, 1ab, M, 4c, 5a, 6b. The E and 3b protein 
products play key roles in coronavirus virulence, and RNA folding demonstrated 
that the mutations in the 5'UTR did not alter the predicted secondary structure. 
The frequency of SNPs in the Spike (S) protein ORF of 0.67% was below the 
genomic average of 0.76%. Only three SNPS were identified in the S1 subunit, 
none of which were located in hypervariable region (HVR) 1 or HVR2. The S2 
subunit was considerably more variable containing 87% of the polymorphisms 
detected across the entire S protein. The S2 subunit also contained a previously 
unreported multi-A insertion site and a stretch of four consecutive mutated 
amino acids, which mapped to the stalk region of the spike protein. 
Template-based protein structure modelling produced the first theoretical model 
of the IBV spike monomer. Given the lack of diversity observed at the 
sub-consensus level, the tenet that the HVRs in the S1 subunit are very tolerant 
of amino acid changes produced by genetic drift is questioned.

The genetic composition of an H5 subtype hemagglutinin gene quasispecies, 
obtained from ostrich tissues that had been infected with H5 subtype influenza 
virus was analysed using a next generation sequencing approach. The first 
evidence for the reiterative copying of a poly (U) stretch in the connecting 
peptide region in the haemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS) by the viral 
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is provided. Multiple non-consensus species 
of RNA were detected in the infected host, corresponding to likely intermediate 
sequences between the putative low pathogenic precursor nucleotide sequence of 
the H5 influenza strain and the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus gene 
sequence. In silico analysis of the identified RNA sequences predicted that the 
intermediary H5 sequence PQREKRGLF plays an important role in subsequent 
mutational events that relocate the HACS coding region from stable base-paired 
RNA regions to a single-stranded bulge, thereby priming the connecting peptide 
coding region for RdRp slippage.

The first recorded outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in South African chickens 
(low pathogenicity H6N2) occurred at Camperdown, KwaZulu/Natal Province (KZN) in 
June 2002. To determine the source of the outbreak, we defined the phylogenetic 
relationships between various H6N2 isolates, and the previously unpublished gene 
sequences of an H6N8 virus isolated in 1998 from ostriches in the Leeu Gamka 
region (A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98). We demonstrated that two distinct 
genetic H6N2 lineages (sub-lineages I and II) circulated in the Camperdown area, 
which later spread to other regions. Sub-lineages I and II shared a recent 
common H6N2 ancestor, which arose from a reassortment event between two South 
African ostrich isolates A/Ostrich/South Africa/9508103/95 and (H9N2) 
A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98 (H6N8). Furthermore, the H6N2 sub-lineage I 
viruses had several molecular genetic markers including a 22-amino acid stalk 
deletion in the neuraminidase (NA) protein gene, a predicted increased 
N-glycosylation, and a D144 mutation of the HA protein gene, all of which are 
associated with the adaptation of AI viruses to chickens. The H6N2 NS1 and PB1 
genes shared recent common ancestors with those of contemporary Asian HPAI H5N1 
viruses. Our results suggest that ostriches are potential mixing vessels for 
avian influenza viruses (AIV) outbreak strains and support other reports that H6 
viruses are capable of forming stable lineages in chickens.

Characterization of pigeon paramyxoviruses (Newcastle disease virus) isolated in South Africa from 2001 to 2006,"<jats:p>Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), a variant of Newcastle disease virus that primarily affects doves and pigeons has been isolated in South Africa since the mid-1980s. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 viruses were introduced in to South Africa on multiple occasions, based on the presence of two separate lineages, 4bi and 4bii, that have been circulating in Europe and the Far East since the early 1990s. During 2006, a PPMV-1 virus was isolated from an African ground hornbil(l Bucorvus leadbeateri) which becamea cutely infected with PPMV-1 and died, probably after scavenging off infected dove carcasses in the region, since a closely-related PPMV-1 strain was also isolated from doves collected nearby. The hornbill isolate had lCPl and MDT values characteristic of PPMV-1s trains. The threat of PPMV-1 to poultry production and biodiversity in southern Africa highlights the importance of monitoring the spread of this strain.</jats:p>",0

In Mexico, the number of cases of the highly virulent Newcastle disease virus is 
increasing. In 2005, an outbreak of Newcastle disease occurred on an egg laying 
hen farm in the state of Puebla despite vaccination with the LaSota strain. 
Farmers experienced a major drop in egg production as a consequence of a field 
challenge virus. In this study, we characterize the virus, 
APMV1/chicken/Mexico/P05/2005, responsible for the outbreak. The virus is 
categorized as a velogenic virus with an intracranial pathogenicity index of 
1.99 and a chicken embryo mean death time of 36 h. The complete genome length of 
the virus was sequenced as consisting of 15,192 bp. In addition, phylogenetic 
analysis classified the virus as a member of the class II, genotype V. The 
highly pathogenic nature of the virus has been linked to the amino acid sequence 
at the fusion protein cleavage site, which contains multiple basic amino acids 
(RRQKR↓F).

The classical porcine parvovirus is an important pathogen of reproductive 
disorders in pigs with a confirmed history of global distribution. The detection 
of many novel porcine parvoviruses has however been on the increase for the past 
few years, but there is a dearth of information on the occurrence and prevalence 
of these viruses in South Africa. Molecular detection of some known 
parvoviruses, namely porcine parvoviruses (PPVs) - 1, 2, 3 and 4, porcine 
bocavirus-like virus (PBo-likeV) and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV1/2), was carried 
out from 110 randomly selected archived swine samples collected in the year 2015 
and 2016. Samples were drawn from previously screened and confirmed porcine 
circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infected farms, with farm-level occurrence ranged from 
5.6 to 60%. The findings showed that all the screened parvoviruses were present 
as follows: PPV1 (29.1%), PPV2 (21.8%), PPV3 (5.5%), PPV4 (43.6%), PBo-likeV 
(21.8%) and PBoV1/2 (44.6%). The frequency of double infections of the viruses 
was as high as 18.2% of PPV2/PPV4 and PPV4/PBoVs; while 17.3% and 7.3% of the 
screened samples showed multiple infections of the three and four viruses 
respectively. Further phylogenetic analyses of partial PPV1, 2 and PBoV1/2 
sequences showed two major clades for each of the viruses. This study reports 
the first epidemiological survey and molecular characterisation of the classical 
and emerging porcine parvoviruses in South African swine herds. It also gives 
insights into the diversity and distribution of these viral pathogens within the 
herds of the study area and confirms their co-infection potentials with PCV2.

Biological Characterization and Next-Generation Genome Sequencing of the Unclassified Cotia Virus SPAn232 (Poxviridae),"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Cotia virus (COTV) SPAn232 was isolated in 1961 from sentinel mice at Cotia field station, São Paulo, Brazil. Attempts to classify COTV within a recognized genus of the
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Poxviridae</jats:named-content>
            have generated contradictory findings. Studies by different researchers suggested some similarity to myxoma virus and swinepox virus, whereas another investigation characterized COTV SPAn232 as a vaccinia virus strain. Because of the lack of consensus, we have conducted an independent biological and molecular characterization of COTV. Virus growth curves reached maximum yields at approximately 24 to 48 h and were accompanied by virus DNA replication and a characteristic early/late pattern of viral protein synthesis. Interestingly, COTV did not induce detectable cytopathic effects in BSC-40 cells until 4 days postinfection and generated viral plaques only after 8 days. We determined the complete genomic sequence of COTV by using a combination of the next-generation DNA sequencing technologies 454 and Illumina. A unique contiguous sequence of 185,139 bp containing 185 genes, including the 90 genes conserved in all chordopoxviruses, was obtained. COTV has an interesting panel of open reading frames (ORFs) related to the evasion of host defense, including two novel genes encoding C-C chemokine-like proteins, each present in duplicate copies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the highest amino acid identity scores with
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Cervidpoxvirus</jats:named-content>
            ,

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Yatapoxvirus</jats:named-content>
            . However, COTV grouped as an independent branch within this clade, which clearly excluded its classification as an
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Orthopoxvirus</jats:named-content>
            . Therefore, our data suggest that COTV could represent a new poxvirus genus.

The objective of this study is to present epizootiological data from the lumpy 
skin disease (LSD) outbreaks in Greece during 2015-16, following the 
implementation of emergency vaccination and total stamping-out, along with 
laboratory data regarding the genetic differentiation between field isolates and 
live attenuated vaccine virus strains. Descriptive geographical chronology 
analysis was conducted to present the progressive shift of the outbreaks 
westwards, and at the same time, the absence of further outbreaks in previously 
affected regional units where high vaccination coverage was achieved. Isolation 
and molecular characterization of LSDV from the first recorded case in Greece 
(Evros/GR/15 isolate) was performed. The two live attenuated LSD vaccine 
viruses, currently used for emergency immunization in Greece, were sequenced and 
compared to the Evros/GR/15 isolate, in 3 genomic regions (GPCR gene, RPO30 
gene, and partial LSDV126/LSDV127 genes). Sequence comparisons revealed 
prominent differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and the vaccine strains. 
Phylogenetic analysis resulted in the classification of the Evros/GR/15 isolate 
in the same clade with all field LSDV isolates, whereas vaccine strains were 
grouped in a distinct cluster within the LSDV clade. Additional samples from 
animals presenting skin nodules (N=13) were characterized by sequencing in the 3 
aforementioned genomic regions. Among them, in 5 animals that were vaccinated, 
the attenuated vaccine virus was identified. A PCR-RFLP method targeting the 
LSDV127 gene was developed and proved to be able to discriminate between the 
characterized field and vaccine strains. The findings of the present study 
substantiate the importance of timely and intensive vaccinations for the control 
of LSDV epizootic and the genetic differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate 
and the vaccine strains. This provides the basis for the development of 
PCR-based DIVA assays, which would be of major importance for effective disease 
surveillance and stamping-out during LSD vaccination campaigns.

Orf virus (ORFV) is a zoonotic pathogen that primarily infects sheep and goats, 
and is responsible for significant economic losses. ORFV is endemic in all the 
major sheep and goat rearing areas of the world including Indian subcontinent. 
However, the nature of ORFV circulating among sheep and goat in Kashmir 
Himalayas has not yet been characterized. In the present study, we describe 
natural outbreaks of ORFV in sheep and goats of Kashmir Himalayas. We detected 
the presence of ORFV in the scab lesion by PCR amplification of the major 
envelope protein (B2L) gene. We sequenced the virus interferon resistance (VIR) 
gene and determined their phylogenetic relationship with that of the published 
reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on VIR gene revealed that the 
ORFV isolates from Kashmir Himalayas separated into main two clusters. The sheep 
isolates showed genetic homology with the sheep strains reported from Greece and 
Italy, whereas the goat-specific strain show homology with the goat strains 
reported from China. This study demonstrates the presence of ORFV infection in 
sheep and goats, and report first phylogenetic analysis of the ORFV strains 
prevalent in the Kashmir Himalayas.

"Host–parasite relations of bacteria and phages can be unveiled by <i>Oligostickiness</i>, a measure of relaxed sequence similarity","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Motivation: The recent metagenome analysis has been producing a large number of host-unassigned viruses. Although assigning viruses to their hosts is basically important not only for virology but also for prevention of epidemic, it has been a laborious and difficult task to date. The only effective method for this purpose has been to find them in a same microscopic view. Now, we tried a computational approach based on genome sequences of bacteria and phages, introducing a physicochemical parameter, SOSS (set of oligostickiness similarity score) derived from oligostickiness, a measure of binding affinity of oligonucleotides to template DNA.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Results: We could confirm host–parasite relationships of bacteria and their phages by SOSS analysis: all phages tested (25 species) had a remarkably higher SOSS value with its host than with unrelated bacteria. Interestingly, according to SOSS values, lysogenic phages such as lambda phage (host: Escherichia coli) or SPP1 (host: Bacillus subtilis) have distinctively higher similarity with its host than its non-lysogenic (excretive or virulent) ones such as fd and T4 (host: E.coli) or phages gamma and PZA (host: B.subtilis). This finding is very promising for assigning host-unknown viruses to its host. We also investigated the relationship in codon usage frequency or G+C content of genomes to interpret the phenomenon revealed by SOSS analysis, obtaining evidences which support the hypothesis that higher SOSS values resulted from the cohabitation in the same environment which may cause the common biased mutation. Thus, lysogenic phages which stay inside longer resemble the host.</jats:p>

We report the laboratory analysis of 125 clinical samples from suspected cases 
of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in cattle and Asian buffalo collected in 
Pakistan between 2008 and 2012. Of these samples, 89 were found to contain viral 
RNA by rRT-PCR, of which 88 were also found to contain infectious FMD virus 
(FMDV) by virus isolation (VI), with strong correlation between these tests 
(κ = 0.96). Samples that were VI-positive were serotyped by antigen detection 
ELISA (Ag-ELISA) and VP1 sequence acquisition and analysis. Sequence data 
identified FMDV serotypes A (n = 13), O (n = 36) and Asia-1 (n = 41), including 
three samples from which both serotypes Asia-1 and O were detected. Serotype A 
viruses were classified within three different Iran-05 sublineages: HER-10, 
FAR-11 and ESF-10. All serotype Asia-1 were within Group VII (Sindh-08 lineage), 
in a genetic clade that differs from viruses isolated prior to 2010. All 
serotypes O were classified as PanAsia-2 within two different sublineages: 
ANT-10 and BAL-09. Using VP1 sequencing as the gold standard for serotype 
determination, the overall sensitivity of Ag-ELISA to correctly determine 
serotype was 74%, and serotype-specific sensitivity was 8% for serotype A, 88% 
for Asia-1 and 89% for O. Serotype-specific specificity was 100% for serotype A, 
93% for Asia-1 and 94% for O. Interestingly, 12 of 13 serotype A viruses were 
not detected by Ag-ELISA. This study confirms earlier accounts of regional 
genetic diversity of FMDV in Pakistan and highlights the importance of continued 
validation of diagnostic tests for rapidly evolving pathogens such as FMDV.

Porcine kobuviruses (PoKoVs) are ubiquitously distributed in pig populations 
worldwide and are thought to be enteric viruses in swine. Although PoKoVs have 
been detected in pigs in Japan, no complete genome data for Japanese PoKoVs are 
available. In the present study, 24 nearly complete or complete sequences of the 
PoKoV genome obtained from 10 diarrheic feces and 14 non-diarrheic feces of 
Japanese pigs were analyzed using a metagenomics approach. Japanese PoKoVs 
shared 85.2-100% identity with the complete coding nucleotide (nt) sequences and 
the closest relationship of 85.1-98.3% with PoKoVs from other countries. Twenty 
of 24 Japanese PoKoVs carried a deletion of 90 nt in the 2B coding region. 
Phylogenetic tree analyses revealed that PoKoVs were not grouped according to 
their geographical region of origin and the phylogenetic trees of the L, P1, P2, 
and P3 genetic regions showed topologies different from each other. Similarity 
plot analysis using strains from a single farm revealed partially different 
similarity patterns among strains from identical farm origins, suggesting that 
recombination events had occurred. These results indicate that various PoKoV 
strains are prevalent and not restricted geographically on pig farms worldwide 
and the coexistence of multiple strains leads to recombination events of PoKoVs 
and contributes to the genetic diversity and evolution of PoKoVs.

USA.

Two new 'legumoviruses' (genus Begomovirus; family Geminiviridae) naturally 
infecting soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) in Nigeria were molecularly 
characterized. Based on characteristic symptoms in soybean, the two viruses are 
provisionally designated as Soybean mild mottle virus (SbMMV) and Soybean 
chlorotic blotch virus (SbCBV). SbCBV has a bipartite genome, whereas SbMMV has 
only a DNA A component. The DNA A component of SbMMV is 2,768 nucleotides (nt) 
long and the DNA A and DNA B components of SbCBV are 2,708 and 2,647 nt long, 
respectively. In pairwise comparisons, the DNA A component of SbMMV and SbCBV 
showed 62% nt sequence identity, indicating that these two viruses are distinct. 
Whereas the DNA A of SbMMV contains two virion- and four complementary-sense 
open reading frames, that of SbCBV lacks the virus-sense AV2, a signature gene 
present in 'Old World' begomoviruses. A pairwise comparison with the 
corresponding nucleotide sequence of other begomoviruses in the databases 
indicated that SbCBV had a maximum of 74% identity with cowpea golden mosaic 
virus and SbMMV had a maximum of 65% identity with mungbean yellow mosaic India 
virus and kudzu mosaic virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA A component of 
SbCBV and SbMMV together with those of other begomoviruses available in the 
databases showed clustering of the two viruses within the 'legumovirus' clade of 
the begomovirus phylogenetic tree. In addition, the DNA A and B components of 
SbCBV from Centrosema pubescens Benth were found to be identical to those from 
soybean, indicating that leguminous wild species are a potential alternative 
host for the virus. Since soybean is an introduced crop, the identification of 
two distinct begomoviruses naturally infecting soybean in Nigeria suggests the 
occurrence of 'legumoviruses' in plant species indigenous to Africa and 
underscores their potential threat to sustainable cultivation of soybean on the 
African continent.

"Genome Characterization of a Pathogenic Porcine Rotavirus B Strain Identified in Buryat Republic, Russia in 2015","<jats:p>An outbreak of enteric disease of unknown etiology with 60% morbidity and 8% mortality in weaning piglets occurred in November 2015 on a farm in Buryat Republic, Russia. Metagenomic sequencing revealed the presence of rotavirus B in feces from diseased piglets while no other pathogens were identified. Clinical disease was reproduced in experimentally infected piglets, yielding the 11 RVB gene segments for strain Buryat15, with an RVB genotype constellation of G12-P[4]-I13-R4-C4-M4-A8-N10-T4-E4-H7. This genotype constellation has also been identified in the United States. While the Buryat15 VP7 protein lacked unique amino acid differences in the predicted neutralizing epitopes compared to the previously published swine RVB G12 strains, this report of RVB in Russian swine increases our epidemiological knowledge on the global prevalence and genetic diversity of RVB.</jats:p>",0

This review is written for the series celebrating the 40th year since the first 
issue of Avian Pathology. The aim of the authors was to cover the developments 
in Newcastle disease (ND) research over the last 40 years that they considered 
significant. During those 40 years there have been several panzootics of this 
serious disease in poultry and for the last 30 years there has been a continuing 
panzootic in domestic pigeons, which has spread to wild birds and poultry. The 
40-year period began with worldwide outbreaks of severe ND, which served as an 
important impetus for ND research work. Although early work was concerned with 
controlling the disease, specifically by improving and developing new vaccines 
and vaccine regimens, even prior to the 1970s ND virus was seen as a useful 
laboratory virus for replication and virulence studies. This review covers the 
historical developments in the following areas: understanding the molecular 
basis of virulence; epidemiology and relatedness of different ND strains, both 
antigenically and genetically; the emergence of virulent strains and their 
relationship with viruses of low virulence; sequencing and understanding the 
viral genome and genes; the development of rapid molecular-based diagnostic 
tests; and the phylogeny and molecular taxonomy of ND virus. The authors suggest 
areas in which future research could or should be undertaken.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) can be made an attractive approach 
for identification of Raman-active compounds and biological materials (i.e., 
toxins, viruses, or intact bacterial cells/spores) through development of 
reproducible, spatially uniform SERS-active substrates. Recently, reproducible 
(from substrate-to-substrate), spatially homogeneous (over large areas) 
SERS-active substrates have been commercialized and are now available in the 
marketplace. We have utilized these patterned surfaces to acquire SERS spectral 
signatures of intact bovine papular stomatitis, pseudocowpox, and Yaba monkey 
tumor viruses. Salient spectral signature features make it possible to 
discriminate among these genetically distinct Poxviridae-Chordopoxvirinae 
virions. In addition, partial least-squares, a multivariate calibration method, 
has been used to develop personal computer-borne algorithms useful for 
classification of unknown Parapoxvirus (e.g., bovine papular stomatitis virus 
and pseudocowpox virus) samples based solely on SERS spectral signatures. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report detailing application of these 
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) SERS-active substrates to identification of 
intact poxviruses.

Standard H&amp;E staining was performed for histological examination of affected organs.</jats:p><jats:p>Eighty-one % of the examined birds, representing 100% of the screened farms, were positive for AI H5N1 virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the isolated virus reveals its affiliation to clade 2.2.1. Viral antigens were localized in the endothelial cells of the heart, liver, lungs and skin, where pathological lesions including congestion, hemorrhages, multifocal inflammation and necrosis were concurrently observed. According to the pattern of the viral antigen and lesion distribution in the visceral organs, we suggest cardiovascular and circulatory failures as the probable cause of death during these outbreaks. In conclusion, the present study further confirms the epidemic status of AI H5N1 virus in Egypt and reveals the highly pathogenic nature of the local isolates.</jats:p>",0

Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV, family Bromoviridae) is found worldwide and 
has been used as a model virus for a long time, but no data is available about 
the genetic diversity of field isolates. Recently, two new field isolates (Car1 
and Car2) of CCMV obtained from cowpea showed distinct phenotypic symptoms when 
inoculated to cowpea. CCMV-Car1 induced severe mosaic and interveinal chlorosis, 
while CCMV-Car2 produced mild mottling and leaf rolling. Both isolates produced 
asymptomatic infection in Nicotiana benthamiana. The complete genome of both 
isolates was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using 
specific primers against the CCMV sequences available in the GenBank database, 
cloned and sequenced. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared 
between the newly sequenced CCMV isolates and the three previously characterized 
CCMV strains (T, M1, and R). Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA 1 sequence showed 
that CCMV-Car1 was in a separate branch from the rest of the CCMV isolates while 
CCMV-Car2 grouped together with CCMV-R. On the basis of RNA 2 and RNA 3 
sequences, two major groupings were obtained. One group included CCMV-Car1 and 
CCMV-Car2 isolates while the other contained CCMV-T, CCMV-M1, and CCMV-R 
strains. Recombination programs detected a potential recombination event in the 
RNA 1 sequence of CCMV-Car2 isolate but not in RNA 2 and RNA 3 sequences. The 
results showed that both mutations and recombination have played an important 
role in the genetic diversity of these two new isolates of CCMV.

Since their first emergence in mid 1990s henipaviruses continued to re emerge in 
Australia and South East Asia almost every year. In total there has been more 
than 12 Nipah and 48 Hendra virus outbreaks reported in South East Asia and 
Australia, respectively. These outbreaks are associated with significant 
economic and health damages that most high risks countries (particularly in 
South East Asia) cannot bear the burden of such economical threats. Up until 
recently, there were no actual therapeutics available to treat or prevent these 
lethal infections. However, an international collaborative research has resulted 
in the identification of a potential equine Hendra vaccine capable of providing 
antibody protection against Hendra virus infections. Consequently, with the 
current findings and after nearly 2 decades since their first detection, are we 
there yet? This review recaps the chronicle of the henipavirus emergence and 
briefly evaluates potential anti-henipavirus vaccines and antivirals.

A virus discovery method incorporating DNase treatment and its application to the identification of two bovine parvovirus species,"<jats:p>
            Identification of previously unrecognized viral agents in serum or
 plasma samples is of great medical interest but remains a major
 challenge, primarily because of abundant host DNA. The current methods,
 library screening or representational difference analysis (RDA), are
 very laborious and require selected sample sets. We have developed a
 simple and reproducible method for discovering viruses in single serum
 samples that is based on DNase treatment of the serum followed by
 restriction enzyme digestion and sequence-independent single primer
 amplification (SISPA) of the fragments, and have evaluated its
 performance on known viruses. Both DNA viruses and RNA viruses at a
 concentration of ≈10
            <jats:sup>6</jats:sup>
            genome equivalents per ml were
 reproducibly identified in 50 μl of serum. While evaluating the
 method, two previously unknown parvoviruses were discovered in the
 bovine sera used as diluent. The near complete genome sequence of each
 virus was determined; their classification as two species
 (provisionally named bovine parvoviruses 2 and 3) was confirmed by
 phylogenetic analysis. Both viruses were found to be frequent
 contaminants of commercial bovine serum. DNase treatment of serum
 samples may prove to be a very useful tool for virus discovery. The
 DNase-SISPA method is suitable for screening of a large number of
 samples and also enables rapid sequence determination of high-titer
 viruses.

Antibiotics in Feed Induce Prophages in Swine Fecal Microbiomes,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Antibiotics are a cost-effective tool for improving feed efficiency and preventing disease in agricultural animals, but the full scope of their collateral effects is not understood. Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; therefore, one collateral effect could be prophage induction in the gut microbiome at large. Here we used metagenomics to evaluate the effect of two antibiotics in feed (carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and penicillin]) on swine intestinal phage metagenomes (viromes). We also monitored the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population shifts in both the phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes, such as multidrug resistance efflux pumps, were identified in the viromes, but in-feed antibiotics caused no significant changes in their abundance. The abundance of phage integrase-encoding genes was significantly increased in the viromes of medicated swine over that in the viromes of nonmedicated swine, demonstrating the induction of prophages with antibiotic treatment. Phage-bacterium population dynamics were also examined. We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            bacteria (prey) when
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            phages (predators) were abundant, supporting the “kill-the-winner” ecological model of population dynamics in the swine fecal microbiome. The data show that gut ecosystem dynamics are influenced by phages and that prophage induction is a collateral effect of in-feed antibiotics.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            This study advances our knowledge of the collateral effects of in-feed antibiotics at a time in which the widespread use of “growth-promoting” antibiotics in agriculture is under scrutiny. Using comparative metagenomics, we show that prophages are induced by in-feed antibiotics in swine fecal microbiomes and that antibiotic resistance genes were detected in most viromes. This suggests that in-feed antibiotics are contributing to phage-mediated gene transfer, potentially of antibiotic resistance genes, in the swine gut. Additionally, the so-called “kill-the-winner” model of phage-bacterium population dynamics has been shown in aquatic ecosystems but met with conflicting evidence in gut ecosystems. The data support the idea that swine fecal
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            bacteria and their phages follow the kill-the-winner model. Understanding the role of phages in gut microbial ecology is an essential component of the antibiotic resistance problem and of developing potential mitigation strategies.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most 
economically significant pathogen in the US swine industry. Aerosol transmission 
among herds is a major concern in pig dense regions and filtration of incoming 
air, in combination with standard biosecurity procedures, has been demonstrated 
to prevent transmission of PRRSV into susceptible herds. To quantify the impact 
of air filtration on reducing risk of PRRSV outbreaks, we compared the incidence 
rate of new PRRSV introductions in 20 filtered and 17 non-filtered control sow 
herds in a swine dense region of North America during a 7 year study period. 
Events of novel virus introduction were ascertained by phylogenetic analysis of 
PRRSV ORF5 gene sequences. Putative new viruses were defined as exogenous 
(introduced) based on ORF5 nucleotide sequence differences compared to previous 
farm isolates. The influence of sequence difference cut-off values ranging from 
2 to 10% on case definition and relative risk were evaluated. Non-filtered farms 
incurred about 0.5 outbreaks per year, with a seasonal increase in risk in 
cooler periods. Baseline risk, prior to filtration, in treatment farms was 
approximately 0.75 per year, approximately 50% higher than in control farms. Air 
filtration significantly reduced risk of PRRSV introduction events to 0.06-0.22 
outbreaks per year, depending on the cut-off values used to classify a virus 
isolate as new to the herd. Overall, air filtration led to an approximately 80% 
reduction in risk of introduction of novel PRRSV, indicating that on large sow 
farms with good biosecurity in swine-dense regions, approximately four-fifths of 
PRRSV outbreaks may be attributable to aerosol transmission.

Characterization of H5N1 influenza A virus that caused the first highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in Saudi Arabia,"<jats:p>Introduction: Saudi Arabia (SA) experienced a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak in domesticated birds in 2007. Methodology: Forty-three hemagglutinin (HA) and 41 neuraminidase (NA) genes of HPAI H5N1 viruses were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses of completely sequenced genes were performed to compare with other viral HA and NA gene sequences available in the public databases. Results: Molecular characterization of the H5N1 viruses revealed two genetically distinct clades, 2.2.2 and 2.3.1, of H5N1 viruses circulating in the area. Amino acid sequence analysis of the HA gene indicated that the virus from 2.2.2 contained the sequence SPQGERRRK-R/G at the cleavage site, while the virus from 2.3.1 contained the sequence SPQRERRRK-R/G. Additionally, a few mutations with amino acid substitutions such as M226I at N-link glycosylation site were identified in two of these isolates. Amino acid sequence of the NA gene showed a 20-amino-acid deletion in the NA stalk region, required for enhanced virulence of influenza viruses and its adaptation from wild birds to domestic chickens. As close contact between humans and birds is unavoidable, there is a need for a thorough understanding of the virus epidemiology, factors affecting the spread of the virus, and molecular characterization such as phylogeny and substitution rates of H5N1 viruses circulating in the region. Conclusion: Two genetically distinct clades were found to be circulating in the country, which could likely result in recombination and emergence of more virulent viral strains. These findings could be helpful for the authorities devising control measures against these viruses.</jats:p>",0

Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) is increasingly considered as responsible for 
various problems of the reproductive tract. The virus infects mainly blood 
mononuclear cells and displays specific tropism for vascular endothelia, 
reproductive and fetal tissues. Epidemiological studies suggest its impact on 
reproductive performance, and its presence in various sites in the reproductive 
tract highlights its potential transmission in transfer-stage embryos. This work 
describes the biological and genetic characterization of BoHV-4 strains isolated 
from an in vitro bovine embryo production system. BoHV-4 strains were isolated 
in 2011 and 2013 from granulosa cells and bovine oocytes from ovary batches 
collected at a local abattoir, used as ""starting material"" for in vitro 
production of bovine embryos. Compatible BoHV-4-CPE was observed in the 
co-culture of granulosa cells and oocytes with MDBK cells. The identity of the 
isolates was confirmed by PCR assays targeting three ORFs of the viral genome. 
The phylogenetic analyses of the strains suggest that they were evolutionary 
unlinked. Therefore it is possible that BoHV-4 ovary infections occurred 
regularly along the evolution of the virus, at least in Argentina, which can 
have implications in the systems of in vitro embryo production. Thus, although 
BoHV-4 does not appear to be a frequent risk factor for in vitro embryo 
production, data are still limited. This study reveals the potential of BoHV-4 
transmission via embryo transfer. Moreover, the high variability among the 
BoHV-4 strains isolated from aborted cows in Argentina highlights the importance 
of further research on the role of this virus as an agent with the potential to 
cause reproductive disease in cattle. The genetic characterization of the 
isolated strains provides data to better understand the pathogenesis of BoHV-4 
infections. Furthermore, it will lead to fundamental insights into the molecular 
aspects of the virus and the means by which these strains circulate in the 
herds.

            <jats:p>The emergence of high pathogenicity strains of Influenza A virus in a variety of human and animal hosts, with wide geographic distribution, has highlighted the importance of rapid identification and subtyping of the virus for outbreak management and treatment. Type A virus can be classified into subtypes according to the viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Here we review the existing specificity and amplification of published primers to subtype neuraminidase genes and describe a new broad spectrum primer pair that can detect all 9 neuraminidase subtypes.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Bioinformatic analysis of 3,337 full-length influenza A neuraminidase segments in the NCBI database revealed semi-conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers with M13 tags, NA8F-M13 and NA10R-M13 were designed from these regions and used to generate a 253 bp cDNA product. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful in 31/32 (97%) cases using a touchdown protocol with RNA from over 32 different cultured influenza A virus strains representing the 9 neuraminidase subtypes. Frozen blinded clinical nasopharyngeal aspirates were also assayed and were mostly of subtype N2. The region amplified was direct sequenced and then used in database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA.

Double-Stranded RNA High-Throughput Sequencing Reveals a New Cytorhabdovirus in a Bean Golden Mosaic Virus-Resistant Common Bean Transgenic Line,"<jats:p>Using double-strand RNA (dsRNA) high-throughput sequencing, we identified five RNA viruses in a bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV)-resistant common bean transgenic line with symptoms of viral infection. Four of the identified viruses had already been described as infecting common bean (cowpea mild mottle virus, bean rugose mosaic virus, Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus 1, and Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus 2) and one is a putative new plant rhabdovirus (genus Cytorhabdovirus), tentatively named bean-associated cytorhabdovirus (BaCV). The BaCV genome presented all five open reading frames (ORFs) found in most rhabdoviruses: nucleoprotein (N) (ORF1) (451 amino acids, aa), phosphoprotein (P) (ORF2) (445 aa), matrix (M) (ORF4) (287 aa), glycoprotein (G) (ORF5) (520 aa), and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) (ORF6) (114 aa), as well as a putative movement protein (P3) (ORF3) (189 aa) and the hypothetical small protein P4. The predicted BaCV proteins were compared to homologous proteins from the closest cytorhabdoviruses, and a low level of sequence identity (15–39%) was observed. The phylogenetic analysis shows that BaCV clustered with yerba mate chlorosis-associated virus (YmCaV) and rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV). Overall, our results provide strong evidence that BaCV is indeed a new virus species in the genus Cytorhabdovirus (family Rhabdoviridae), the first rhabdovirus to be identified infecting common bean.</jats:p>",0
Bovine-like coronaviruses in domestic and wild ruminants,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) produce a wide spectrum of disease syndromes in different mammalian and avian host species. These viruses are well-recognized for their ability to change tissue tropism, to hurdle the interspecies barriers and to adapt ecological variations. It is predicted that the inherent genetic diversity of CoVs caused by accumulation of point mutations and high frequency of homologous recombination is the principal determinant of these competences. Several CoVs (e.g. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) have been recorded to cross the interspecies barrier, inducing different disease conditions in variable animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is a primary cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in cattle calves, winter dysentery in lactating cows and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Although it has long been known as a restrictive cattle pathogen, CoVs that are closely related to BCoV have been recognized in dogs, humans and in other ruminant species. Biologic, antigenic and genetic analyses of the so-called ‘bovine-like CoVs’ proposed classification of these viruses as host-range variants rather than distinct virus species. In this review, the different bovine-like CoVs that have been identified in domesticated ruminants (water buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary camel, llama and alpaca) and wild ruminants (deer, wild cattle, antelopes, giraffes and wild goats) are discussed in terms of epidemiology, transmission and virus characteristics. The presented data denote the importance of these viruses in the persistence of BCoV in nature, spread to new geographical zones, and continuous emergence of disease epidemics in cattle farms.</jats:p>",0

Pigs harbor a variety of viruses that are closely related to human viruses and 
are suspected to have zoonotic potential. Little is known about the presence of 
viruses in smallholder farms where pigs are in close contact with humans and 
wildlife. This study provides insight into viral communities and the prevalence 
and characteristics of enteric viral co-infections in smallholder pigs in East 
Africa. Sequence-independent amplification and high-throughput sequencing were 
applied to the metagenomics analysis of viruses in feces collected from 
asymptomatic pigs. A total of 47,213 de novo-assembled contigs were constructed 
and compared with sequences from the GenBank database. Blastx search results 
revealed that 1039 contigs (>200 nt) were related to viral sequences in the 
GenBank database. Of the 1039 contigs, 612 were not assigned to any viral taxa 
because they had little similarity to known viral genomic or protein sequences, 
while 427 contigs had a high level of sequence similarity to known viruses and 
were assigned to viral taxa. The most frequent contigs related to mammalian 
viruses resembling members of the viral genera Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Bocavirus, 
Circovirus, and Kobuvirus. Other less abundant contigs were related to members 
of the genera Sapelovirus, Pasivirus, Posavirus, Teschovirus and Picobirnavirus. 
This is the first report on the diversity of the fecal virome of pig populations 
in East Africa. The findings of the present study help to elucidate the etiology 
of diarrheal diseases in pigs and identify potential zoonotic and emerging 
viruses in the region. Further investigations are required to compare the 
incidence of these viruses in healthy and diseased pigs in order to better 
elucidate their pathogenic role.

"Multi-year evolutionary dynamics of West Nile virus in suburban Chicago, USA, 2005–2007","<jats:p>
            West Nile virus has evolved in concert with its expansion across North America, but little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of the virus on local scales. We analysed viral nucleotide sequences from mosquitoes collected in 2005, 2006, and 2007 from a known transmission ‘hot spot’ in suburban Chicago, USA. Within this approximately 11 × 14 km area, the viral envelope gene has increased approximately 0.1% yr
            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>
            in nucleotide-level genetic diversity. In each year, viral diversity was higher in ‘residential’ sites characterized by dense housing than in more open ‘urban green space’ sites such as cemeteries and parks. Phylodynamic analyses showed an increase in incidence around 2005, consistent with a higher-than-average peak in mosquito and human infection rates that year. Analyses of times to most recent common ancestor suggest that WNV in 2005 and 2006 may have arisen predominantly from viruses present during 2004 and 2005, respectively, but that WNV in 2007 had an older common ancestor, perhaps indicating a predominantly mixed or exogenous origin. These results show that the population of WNV in suburban Chicago is an admixture of viruses that are both locally derived and introduced from elsewhere, containing evolutionary information aggregated across a breadth of spatial and temporal scales.

Bayesian Inference (BI) and Neighbor Joining (NJ) analyses of the phylogenetic 
relationships between the nucleotide sequences of the N gene of Akabane virus 
revealed an unclear topology among genogroups I-III, which was probably caused 
by genetic reassortment or recombination between these genogroups. In contrast, 
nucleotide and amino acid phylogenetic tree analyses of the M RNA segment agreed 
with the topologies obtained by using the BI and NJ methods. Therefore, distinct 
genogrouping of Akabane virus isolates should be performed using the M RNA 
segment. Four Korea isolates were classified into genogroup II together with 
Akabane virus strains isolated from all areas of Japan, including Okinawa 
Island. However, more nationwide isolates and more clinical data from Korean 
cattle farms will be required in the future to confirm the precise relationships 
between genotypes and pathogenicity.

Whole genome analysis of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus identified limited genome constellations and preferential reassortment,"<jats:p>Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is a <jats:italic>Culicoides</jats:italic> transmitted orbivirus that causes haemorrhagic disease in wild and domestic ruminants. A collection of 44 EHDV isolated from 2008 to 2012 was fully sequenced and analysed phylogenetically. Serotype 2 viruses were the dominant serotype all years except 2012 when serotype 6 viruses represented 63 % of the isolates. High genetic similarity (&gt;94 % identity) between serotype 1 and 2 virus VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, NS1, NS2 and NS3 segments prevented identification of reassortment events for these segments. Additionally, there was little genetic diversity (&gt;96 % identity) within serotypes for VP2, VP5 and VP7. Preferential reassortment within the homologous serotype was observed for VP2, VP5 and VP7 segments for type 1 and type 2 viruses. In contrast, type 6 viruses were all reassortants containing VP2 and VP5 derived from an exotic type 6 with the remaining segments most similar to type 2 viruses. These results suggest that reassortment between type 1 and type 2 viruses requires conservation of the VP2, VP5 and VP7 segment constellation while type 6 viruses only require VP2 and VP5 and are restricted to type 2-lineage VP7. As type 6 VP2 and VP5 segments were exclusively identified in viruses with type 2-derived VP7, these results suggest functional complementation between type 2 and type 6 VP7 proteins.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: Rumen microbes play a greater role in host energy acquisition than 
that of gut-associated microbes in monogastric animals. Although genome-enabled 
advancements are providing access to the vast diversity of uncultivated 
microbes, our understanding of variables shaping rumen microbial communities is 
in its infancy. Viruses have been shown to impact microbial populations through 
a myriad of processes, including cell lysis and reprogramming of host 
metabolism. However, little is known about the processes shaping the 
distribution of rumen viruses or how viruses may modulate microbial-driven 
processes in the rumen. To this end, we investigated how rumen bacterial and 
viral community structure and function responded in five steers fed four 
randomized dietary treatments in a crossover design.
RESULTS: Total digestible nutrients (TDN), a measure of dietary energy, best 
explained the variation in bacterial and viral communities. Additional 
ecological drivers of viral communities included dietary zinc content and 
microbial functional diversity. Using partial least squares regression, we 
demonstrate significant associations between the abundances of 267 viral 
populations and variables driving the variation in rumen viral communities. 
While rumen viruses were dynamic, 14 near ubiquitous viral populations were 
identified, suggesting the presence of a core rumen virome largely comprised of 
novel viruses. Moreover, analysis of virally encoded auxiliary metabolic genes 
(AMGs) indicates rumen viruses have glycosidic hydrolases to potentially augment 
the breakdown of complex carbohydrates to increase energy production. Other AMGs 
identified have a role in redirecting carbon to the pentose phosphate pathway 
and one carbon pools by folate to boost viral replication.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that rumen bacteria and viruses have differing 
responses and ecological drivers to dietary perturbation. Our results show that 
rumen viruses have implications for understanding the structuring of the 
previously identified core rumen microbiota and impacting microbial metabolism 
through a vast array of AMGs. AMGs in the rumen appear to have consequences for 
microbial metabolism that are largely in congruence with the current paradigm 
established in marine systems. This study provides a foundation for future 
hypotheses regarding the dynamics of viral-mediated processes in the rumen.

Multiple genetically and antigenically distinct hemagglutinin genes of the H1 
and H3 influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes co-circulate in North American swine. 
This diversity has evolved by repeated transmission of IAVs from humans to swine 
and subsequent antigenic drift in swine. To understand the evolutionary dynamics 
of these diverse HA lineages in North American swine, we undertook a 
phylogenetic analysis of 1576 H1 and 607 H3 HA gene segments, as well as 834 N1 
and 1293 N2 NA gene segments, and 2126 M gene segments. These data revealed 
yearly co-circulation of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses, with three HA clades 
representing the majority of the HA sequences: of the H1 viruses, 42% were 
classified as H1δ1 and 40.6% were classified as H1γ; and of the H3 viruses 53% 
were classified as cluster IV-A H3N2. We detected a genetically distinct minor 
clade consisting of 37 H1 viruses isolated between 2003 and 2013, which we 
classified as H1γ-2. We estimated that this clade circulated in swine since 
approximately 1995, but it was not detected in swine until 2003. Though this 
clade only represents 1.07% of swine H1 sequences reported over the past 10 
years, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays demonstrated that representatives 
of this clade of viruses are antigenically distinct, and, when measured using 
antigenic cartography, were as many as 7 antigenic units from other H1γ viruses. 
Therefore vaccines against the contemporary H1γ viruses are not likely to 
cross-protect against γ-2 viruses. The long-term circulation of these γ-2 
viruses suggests that minor populations of viruses may be underreported in the 
national dataset given the long branch lengths and gaps in detections. The 
identification of these γ-2 viruses demonstrates the need for robust 
surveillance to capture the full diversity IAVs in swine in the USA and the 
importance of antigenic drift in the diversification and emergence of new 
antigenic variants in swine, which complicates vaccine design.

A Phylogeny-Based Global Nomenclature System and Automated Annotation Tool for H1 Hemagglutinin Genes from Swine Influenza A Viruses,"<jats:p>A fundamental goal in the biological sciences is the definition of groups of organisms based on evolutionary history and the naming of those groups. For influenza A viruses (IAVs) in swine, understanding the hemagglutinin (HA) genetic lineage of a circulating strain aids in vaccine antigen selection and allows for inferences about vaccine efficacy. Previous reporting of H1 virus HA in swine relied on colloquial names, frequently with incriminating and stigmatizing geographic toponyms, making comparisons between studies challenging. To overcome this, we developed an adaptable nomenclature using measurable criteria for historical and contemporary evolutionary patterns of H1 global swine IAVs. We also developed a web-accessible tool that classifies viruses according to this nomenclature. This classification system will aid agricultural production and pandemic preparedness through the identification of important changes in swine IAVs and provides terminology enabling discussion of swine IAVs in a common context among animal and human health initiatives.</jats:p>",0

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction has been used worldwide for the 
diagnosis of Norwalk-like virus (NLV) infection, yet a commonly accepted genetic 
classification scheme has not been established. Amino acid sequences from four 
regions of open-reading frame 2 (ORF2) were used to analyze 101 NLV strains, 
including 2 bovine strains. On the basis of this analysis, a genetic 
classification scheme is proposed that differentiates 99 human strains into 2 
major genetic groups consisting of 5 and 10 genetic clusters, respectively. The 
2 bovine strains constitute a newly defined third major genetic group composed 
of 2 putative clusters represented by each strain. This classification scheme is 
well supported by the analysis of the entire ORF2 sequences from 38 strains 
selected to represent the genetic diversity of the human strains used above. 
This scheme should provide a firm scientific basis for the unified 
classification of NLV strains detected around the world.

Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the genus Henipavirus of the family 
Paramyxoviridae, characterized by high pathogenicity and endemic in South Asia. 
It is classified as a Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) agent. The case-fatality varies 
from 40% to 70% depending on the severity of the disease and on the availability 
of adequate healthcare facilities. At present no antiviral drugs are available 
for NiV disease and the treatment is just supportive. Phylogenetic and 
evolutionary analyses can be used to help in understanding the epidemiology and 
the temporal origin of this virus. This review provides an overview of 
evolutionary studies performed on Nipah viruses circulating in different 
countries. Thirty phylogenetic studies have been published from 2000 to 2015 
years, searching on pub-med using the key words 'Nipah virus AND phylogeny' and 
twenty-eight molecular epidemiological studies from 2006 to 2015 have been 
performed, typing the key words 'Nipah virus AND molecular epidemiology'. 
Overall data from the published study demonstrated as phylogenetic and 
evolutionary analysis represent promising tools to evidence NiV epidemics, to 
study their origin and evolution and finally to act with effective preventive 
measure.

Origin of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus as studied by codon usage patterns and phylogenetic analysis,"<jats:p>The pandemic of 1918 was caused by an H1N1 influenza A virus, which is a negative strand RNA virus; however, little is known about the nature of its direct ancestral strains. Here we applied a broad genetic and phylogenetic analysis of a wide range of influenza virus genes, in particular the<jats:italic>PB1</jats:italic>gene, to gain information about the phylogenetic relatedness of the 1918 H1N1 virus. We compared the RNA genome of the 1918 strain to many other influenza strains of different origin by several means, including relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC), and phylogenetic relationship. We found that the<jats:italic>PB1</jats:italic>gene of the 1918 pandemic virus had ENC values similar to the H1N1 classical swine and human viruses, but different ENC values from avian as well as H2N2 and H3N2 human viruses. Also, according to the RSCU of the<jats:italic>PB1</jats:italic>gene, the 1918 virus grouped with all human isolates and “classical” swine H1N1 viruses. The phylogenetic studies of all eight RNA gene segments of influenza A viruses may indicate that the 1918 pandemic strain originated from a H1N1 swine virus, which itself might be derived from a H1N1 avian precursor, which was separated from the bulk of other avian viruses in toto a long time ago. The high stability of the RSCU pattern of the<jats:italic>PB1</jats:italic>gene indicated that the integrity of RNA structure is more important for influenza virus evolution than previously thought.</jats:p>",0

In 2016, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus was detected in 
wild birds for the first time in Egypt. In the present study, we identified the 
HPAI virus H5N8 of clade 2.3.4.4 from domestic waterfowl in Egypt, suggesting 
its transmission to the domestic poultry from the migratory birds. Based on 
partial haemagglutinin gene sequence, this virus has a close genetic 
relationship with subtype H5N8 viruses circulating in Asia and Europe. 
Pathologically, H5N8 virus in hybrid duck induced nervous signs accompanied by 
encephalomalacia, haemorrhages, nonsuppurative encephalitis and nonsuppurative 
vasculitis. The granular layer of cerebellum showed multifocal areas of hydropic 
degeneration and the Purkinje cell neurons were necrotized or lost. 
Additionally, the lung, kidney and spleen were congested, and necrotizing 
pancreatitis was also observed. The co-circulation of both HPAI H5N1 and H5N8 
subtypes with the low pathogenic avian influenza H9N2 subtype complicate the 
control of avian influenza in Egypt with the possibility of emergence of new 
reassortant viruses. Therefore, continuous monitoring with implementation of 
strict control measures is required. Research highlights HPAI H5N8 virus clade 
2.3.4.4 was detected in domestic ducks and geese in Egypt in 2017. 
Phylogenetically, the virus was closely related to HPAI H5N8 viruses identified 
in Asia and Europe Nonsuppurative encephalitis was widely observed in HPAI H5N8 
virus-infected ducks. Degeneration of the cerebellar granular layer was found in 
most of the brain tissues examined.

Bocaparvovirus (BOV) is a genetically diverse group of DNA viruses and a 
possible cause of respiratory, enteric, and neurological diseases in humans and 
animals. Here, two highly divergent BOVs (tentatively named as Himalayan marmot 
BOV, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2) were identified in the livers and feces of wild 
Himalayan marmots in China, by viral metagenomic analysis. Five of 300 liver 
samples from Himalayan marmots were positive for HMBOV1 and five of 99 fecal 
samples from these animals for HMBOV2. Their nearly complete genome sequences 
are 4,672 and 4,887 nucleotides long, respectively, with a standard genomic 
organization and containing protein-coding motifs typical for BOVs. Based on 
their NS1, NP1, and VP1, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are most closely related to porcine 
BOV SX/1-2 (approximately 77.0%/50.0%, 50.0%/53.0%, and 79.0%/54.0% amino acid 
identity, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of these three proteins showed 
that HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 formed two distinctly independent branches in BOVs. 
According to these results, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are two different novel species in 
the Bocaparvovirus genus. Their identification expands our knowledge of the 
genetic diversity and evolution of BOVs. Further studies are needed to 
investigate their potential pathogenicity and their impact on Himalayan marmots 
and humans.

BACKGROUND: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype 
are widely distributed within poultry populations in Egypt and have caused 
multiple human infections. Linking the epidemiological and sequence data is 
important to understand the transmission, persistence and evolution of the 
virus. This work describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H5N1 based on molecular 
characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of isolates collected from 
February 2006 to May 2014.
METHODS: Full-length HA sequences of 368 H5N1 viruses were generated and were 
genetically analysed to study their genetic evolution. They were collected from 
different poultry species, production sectors, and geographic locations in 
Egypt. The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method was applied to 
estimate the evolutionary rates among different virus clusters; additionally, an 
analysis of selection pressures in the HA gene was performed using the Single 
Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) method.
RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis of the H5 gene from 2006-14 indicated the 
presence of one virus introduction of the classic clade (2.2.1) from which two 
main subgroups were originated, the variant subgroup which was further 
subdivided into 2 sub-divisions (2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.1a) and the endemic subgroup 
(2.2.1.2). The clade 2.2.1.2 showed a high evolution rate over a period of 6 
years (6.9 × 10(-3) sub/site/year) in comparison to the 2.2.1.1a variant cluster 
(7.2 × 10(-3) over a period of 4 years). Those two clusters are under positive 
selection as they possess 5 distinct positively selected sites in the HA gene. 
The mutations at 120, 154, and 162 HA antigenic sites and the other two 
mutations (129∆, I151T) that occurred from 2009-14 were found to be stable in 
the 2.2.1.2 clade. Additionally, 13 groups of H5N1 HPAI viruses were identified 
based on their amino acid sequences at the cleavage site and ""EKRRKKR"" became 
the dominant pattern beginning in 2013.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous evolution of H5N1 HPAI viruses in Egypt has been 
observed in all poultry farming and production systems in almost all regions of 
the country. The wide circulation of the 2.2.1.2 clade carrying triple mutations 
(120, 129∆, I151T) associated with increased binding affinity to human receptors 
is an alarming finding of public health importance.

The suspected presence of avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 in poultry in Egypt 
is a major concern since this subtype is widely distributed in different 
countries in the Middle East, here we describe the full genetic characterization 
of an avian influenza A virus (Qa/Egypt/11; H9N2) of subtype H9N2 that was 
previously isolated from a clinically normal quail flock in Giza, Egypt in May 
2011. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of the isolated 
Egyptian virus showed the highest similarity with one group of recent Israeli 
strains (97 %) circulating from 2006-2010. Sequence homology and phylogenetic 
analysis indicated that the Qa/Egypt/11 isolate belonged to the A/quail/Hong 
Kong/G1/1997-like lineage with new mutations identified in all viral proteins. 
The phylogenetic analysis for the eight genes indicated placement of the 
Egyptian virus within the same lineage of H9N2 viruses that circulated in the 
region from 2006, especially with one group of recent Israeli strains. However, 
phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes like PB2, NP, and PA genes 
identified possible reassortment events for these genes with singular Israeli 
strains. This study indicates progressive evolution of this subtype in the 
Middle East region and possible mechanism of virus adaptation in land-based 
poultry like in quails.

Classical swine fever (CSF) is considered to be endemic in Peru with outbreaks 
reported to the World Organization for Animal Health as recently as 2008 and 
2009. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the genetic subgroup(s) of CSF 
virus that are circulating in Peru or their relationship to recent CSF viruses 
that have been isolated from neighbouring South American countries or other 
parts of the world. In this study, we molecularly characterize CSF viruses that 
were isolated from domestic pigs from different regions of Peru from the middle 
of 2007 to early 2008. All virus isolates were found to belong to genetic 
subgroup 1.1, consistent with the subgroup of viruses that have been identified 
from other South American countries. Although the Peruvian isolates are most 
closely related to viruses from Colombia and Brazil, they form a monophyletic 
clade, which suggests they have a distinct evolutionary history.

The second largest outbreak of West Nile encephalitis and West Nile fever ever 
recorded occurred in the United States (U.S) in the summer of 2012. The outbreak 
was related to the widespread circulation of closely related clades, or groups, 
of West Nile virus (WNV) into multiple states where they were not previously 
found. Whether the invading 2012 strains were able to circulate and overwinter 
in states with their own endemic population of WNV is unknown and the effect of 
viral genetics on adaptation and persistence in a new ecological niche is 
unclear. In this study, we sequenced 70 mosquito isolates from multiple counties 
throughout Texas in 2012-2015. We identified isolates representative of 
previously described 2012 WNV groups (Groups 8-10) and discovered a novel group 
which we called Group 11. Although we identified isolates representative of WNV 
endemic (2/70) to Texas, most isolates (68/70) were related to the invading 2012 
strains, and of these Group 10 (45/68) was predominant. We also observed 
differences among the 2012 WNV groups correlating to their genotype. Group 10 
WNV in Texas, which carry two putative positively selected variants, had limited 
introductions into Texas, wide circulation, and strong evidence of continued 
persistence perhaps indicative of overwintering. In contrast, Groups 8 and 11, 
without positively selected variants, had multiple introductions into Texas, 
limited circulation, and limited persistence. Lastly, we identified a potential 
transmission source in New York for incoming Group 8 WNV into Texas. Altogether 
our study suggests that mutations in the WNV genome may influence the range and 
dynamics of WNV circulation, and the ability of different strains to persist in 
new ecological niches.

The aim of the present investigation was to discover the genetic relationships 
of 2009 pandemic novel influenza A/H1N1 virus (NIV) external antigens 
Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) with other influenza viruses by 
performing phylogenetic, comparative and statistical analyses. Phylogenetic 
trees of these two antigens show that the sequences of the NIV viruses are 
relatively homogeneous and these were derived from several viruses circulating 
in swine. The phylogenetic tree of HA shows that NIV had the closest 
relationship with North-American pig lineages whereas NA had with European pig 
lineages. In both segments, NIVs had the closest genetic relationship with swine 
influenza virus lineages. It strongly suggests that pigs are the most possible 
animal reservoir. Comparative analysis shows that among clade A, NIVs had very 
low genetic divergence as well as high similarity and also suffered strong 
purifying selection whereas neighbor clade B shows moderate values when compared 
to those of clades C-F. It indicates that classical swine influenza viruses 
present in clade B might be an ancestor of NIVs external antigens. The process 
of re-assortment occurred in classical swine influenza viruses. The mutation 
sites exclusively fixed in the NIV of swine and human along with vaccine strain 
provide an important suggestion for disease diagnosis and vaccine research.

Metagenomic Virome Analysis of Culex Mosquitoes from Kenya and China,"<jats:p>Many blood-feeding arthropods are known vectors of viruses that are a source of unprecedented global health concern. Mosquitoes are an integral part of these arthropod vectors. Advancements in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics has expanded our knowledge on the richness of viruses harbored by arthropods. In the present study, we applied a metagenomic approach to determine the intercontinental virome diversity of Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus in Kwale, Kenya and provinces of Hubei and Yunnan in China. Our results showed that viromes from the three locations were strikingly diverse and comprised 30 virus families specific to vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and protozoa as well as unclassified group of viruses. Though sampled at different times, both Kwale and Hubei mosquito viromes were dominated by vertebrate viruses, in contrast to the Yunnan mosquito virome, which was dominated by insect-specific viruses. However, each virome was unique in terms of virus proportions partly influenced by type of ingested meals (blood, nectar, plant sap, environment substrates). The dominant vertebrate virus family in the Kwale virome was Papillomaviridae (57%) while in Hubei it was Herpesviridae (30%) and the Yunnan virome was dominated by an unclassified viruses group (27%). Given that insect-specific viruses occur naturally in their hosts, they should be the basis for defining the viromes. Hence, the dominant insect-specific viruses in Kwale, Hubei, and Yunnan were Baculoviridae, Nimaviridae and Iflaviridae, respectively. Our study is preliminary but contributes to growing and much needed knowledge, as mosquito viromes could be manipulated to prevent and control pathogenic arboviruses.</jats:p>",0

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. To further 
understand its complex epidemiology, which involves multiple virus serotypes and 
host species, we characterized the viruses recovered from FMD outbreaks in 
Ethiopia during 1981-2007. We detected 5 of the 7 FMDV serotypes (O, A, C, 
Southern African Territories [SAT] 1, and SAT 2). Serotype O predominated, 
followed by serotype A; type C was not recognized after 1983. Phylogenetic 
analysis of virus protein 1 sequences indicated emergence of a new topotype 
within serotype O, East Africa 4. In 2007, serotype SAT 1 was detected in 
Ethiopia and formed a new distinct topotype (IX), and serotype SAT 2 reappeared 
after an apparent gap of 16 years. The diversity of viruses highlights the role 
of this region as a reservoir for FMD virus, and their continuing emergence in 
Ethiopia will greatly affect spread and consequent control strategy of the 
disease on this continent.

Triple-reassortant swine influenza A (H1) viruses, containing genes from avian, 
human, and swine influenza viruses, emerged and became an outbreak among humans 
worldwide. Over a 1,000 cases were identified within the first month, chiefly in 
Mexico and the United States. Here, the phylogenetic analysis of haemagglutin 
(HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein (MP) was carried out. The analysis 
showed that the H1 of this reassortant originated from American pigs, while NA 
and MP were more likely from European pigs. All of the 2009 isolates appear 
homogeneous and cluster together, although they are distinct from classical 
human A (H1N1) viruses.

The genome of a herpesvirus highly pathogenic to rabbits, leporid herpesvirus 4 
(LHV-4), was analyzed using high-throughput DNA sequencing technology and primer 
walking. The assembled DNA sequences were further verified by restriction 
endonuclease digestion and Southern blot analyses. The total length of the LHV-4 
genome was determined to be about 124 kb. Genes encoded in the LHV-4 genome are 
most closely related to herpesvirus of the Simplexvirus genus, including human 
herpesviruses (HHV-1 and HHV-2), monkey herpesviruses including cercopithicine 
(CeHV-2 and CeHV-16), macacine (McHV-1), bovine herpesvirus 2 (BHV-2), and a 
lineage of wallaby (macropodid) herpesviruses (MaHV-1 and -2). Similar to other 
simplexvirus genomes, LHV-4 has a high overall G+C content of 65-70% in the 
unique regions and 75-77% in the inverted repeat regions. Orthologs of ICP34.5 
and US5 were not identified in the LHV-4 genome. This study shows that LHV-4 has 
the smallest simplexvirus genome characterized to date.

            Hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to represent one of the most significant threats to human health. In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses, and dogs, indicating a widespread distribution of hepaciviruses among animals. By applying unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a novel virus of the genus

Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of animals from one dairy herd proved that a substantial percentage of cows were infected, with some of them being viremic for over 6 months. Clinical and postmortem examination revealed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from different organs and tissues, together with the presence of an miR-122 binding site in the viral genome, strongly suggests a liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for HCV infections in humans.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Livestock animals act as important sources for emerging pathogens. In particular, their large herd size and the existence of multiple ways of direct and food-borne infection routes emphasize their role as virus reservoirs. Apart from the search for novel viruses, detailed characterization of these pathogens is indispensable in the context of risk analysis. Here, we describe the identification of a novel HCV-like virus in cattle. In addition, determination of the prevalence and of the course of infection in cattle herds provides valuable insights into the biology of this novel virus. The results presented here form a basis for future studies targeting viral pathogenesis of bovine hepaciviruses and their potential to establish zoonotic infections.

Migratory waterfowls are the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses. However, 
interspecies transmission had occasionally caused outbreaks in various hosts 
including humans. To characterize the genetic origins of H5 avian influenza 
viruses isolated from migratory birds in South Korea, phylogenetic analysis were 
conducted. A total of 53 H5 viruses were isolated between October 2005 and 
November 2008. Full genetic characterization indicated that most of these 
viruses belong to the Eurasian-like avian lineage. However, some segments of the 
AB/Korea/W235/07 and the AB/Korea/W236/07 isolates were clustered with North 
American lineage viruses rather than those of the Eurasian lineage, suggesting 
the occurrence of reassortment between these two avian virus lineages. 
Phylogenetic analysis further demonstrated that the H5N2 and H5N3 virus isolates 
were of the low pathogenicity H5 phenotype. The H5 viruses appear to be 
antigenically similar to each other, but could be distinguished from a recent 
HPAI H5N1 (EM/Korea/W149/06) virus by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays. 
Experimental inoculation of representative viruses indicated that certain 
isolates, particularly AB/Korea/W163/07 (H5N2), could be detected in trachea and 
lungs of chickens but none could be transmitted by direct contact. Furthermore, 
all of the viruses could be detected in mice lung without prior adaptation which 
is indicative of their pathogenic potential in a mammalian host. Overall, our 
results emphasize the important role that migratory birds play in the 
perpetuation, transport, and reassortment of avian influenza viruses stressing 
the need for continued surveillance of influenza virus activity in these avian 
populations.

In the present study, a novel cell penetrating peptide (CPP) named as Rath, has 
been identified from the avian infectious bursal disease virus. It has the 
potential to penetrate and translocate cargo molecules into cells independent of 
temperature. Additionally, it can deliver oligonucleotide in 30min and 
antibodies within an hour intracellular to chicken embryonic fibroblast primary 
cells. As an ideal delivery vehicle, it has the ability to protect the cargo 
molecules in the presence of serum, nucleases and has minimal or no cytotoxicity 
at even higher peptide concentrations studied. The biophysical characterizations 
showed that Rath has a dominant beta structure with a small alpha helix and has 
remarkable binding ability with protein and DNA. Thus, the characterization of 
unique Rath peptide to deliver protein or nucleic acid into the cells with 
non-covalent interaction could be used as an effective delivery method for 
various cell based assays.

Poxviruses in Bats … so What?,"<jats:p>Poxviruses are important pathogens of man and numerous domestic and wild animal species. Cross species (including zoonotic) poxvirus infections can have drastic consequences for the recipient host. Bats are a diverse order of mammals known to carry lethal viral zoonoses such as Rabies, Hendra, Nipah, and SARS. Consequent targeted  research is revealing bats to be infected with a rich diversity of novel viruses. Poxviruses were recently identified in bats and the settings in which they were found were  dramatically different. Here, we review the natural history of poxviruses in bats and  highlight the relationship of the viruses to each other and their context in the Poxviridae family. In addition to considering the zoonotic potential of these viruses, we reflect on the broader implications of these findings. Specifically, the potential to explore and exploit this newfound relationship to study coevolution and cross species transmission together with fundamental aspects of poxvirus host tropism as well as bat virology and immunology.</jats:p>",0
"Novel, Potentially Zoonotic Paramyxoviruses from the African Straw-Colored Fruit Bat Eidolon helvum","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bats carry a variety of paramyxoviruses that impact human and domestic animal health when spillover occurs. Recent studies have shown a great diversity of paramyxoviruses in an urban-roosting population of straw-colored fruit bats in Ghana. Here, we investigate this further through virus isolation and describe two novel rubulaviruses: Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2). The viruses form a phylogenetic cluster with each other and other bat-derived rubulaviruses, such as Tuhoko viruses, Menangle virus, and Tioman virus. We developed AchPV1- and AchPV2-specific serological assays and found evidence of infection with both viruses in

In this study, peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) was detected in frozen 
pooled tissue samples from a dead Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica). The 
samples were negative for canine distemper virus and positive for PPRV nucleic 
acids when tested with one-step RT-PCR using the appropriate virus-specific 
primers. Subsequent amplification, cloning, and sequencing of the partial 
nucleocapsid, matrix, and fusion genes confirmed the presence of PPRV nucleic 
acid. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the structural genes of 
the isolated virus confirmed that the virus belonged to Asian lineage IV and was 
closely related to PPRV circulating in India.

Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute, highly contagious, notifiable and 
economically important transboundary viral disease of sheep and goats. In this 
study, sequence and phylogenetic analyses of structural protein genes, namely 
the nucleocapsid (N), the matrix (M), the fusion (F) and the haemagglutinin (H) 
coding sequences of virulent and vaccine strains of PPR virus (PPRV), were 
undertaken to determine the genetic variations between field isolates and 
vaccine strains. The open reading frame (ORF) of these genes of the 
isolates/strains was amplified by RT-PCR, cloned and sequenced. The ORF of N, M, 
F and H genes was 1578, 1008, 1641 and 1830 nucleotides (nt) in length and 
encodes polypeptides of 525, 335, 546 and 609 amino acids (aa), respectively, as 
reported earlier. Comparative sequence analyses of these four genes of 
isolates/strains were carried out with published sequences. It revealed an 
identity of 97.7-100% and 97.7-99.8% among the Asian lineage IV and 89.6-98.7% 
and 89.8-98.9% with other lineages of PPRV at nt and aa levels, respectively. 
The phylogenetic analyses of these isolates based on the aa sequences showed 
that all the viruses belonged to lineage IV along with other Asian isolates. 
This is in agreement with earlier observations that only PPRV lineage IV is in 
circulation in India since the disease was first reported. Further, sequence 
analysis of the thermostable/thermo-adapted vaccine strains showed no 
significant changes in the functional or structural surface protein-coding gene 
sequences. It is important to monitor the circulation of the PPRV in susceptible 
animals by H gene-based sequence comparisons in addition to the F gene- and N 
gene-based approaches to identify the distribution and spread of virus in the 
regular outbreaks that occur in endemic countries like India.

Avian infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious viral disease with economic 
effects on poultry agribusiness. The disease presents multi-systemic clinical 
signs (respiratory, renal, enteric, and reproductive) and is caused by one 
coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV). Infectious bronchitis virus is 
classified into different serotypes and genotypes (vaccine strains and field 
variants). This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of IBV in commercial 
poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions in Brazil and to determine the 
tropism of the main circulating genotypes to 3 different avian physiological 
systems (respiratory, digestive, urinary/reproductive). Clinical samples with 
suggestive signs of IBV infection were collected from 432 different poultry 
commercial flocks (198 from broilers and 234 from breeders). The total number of 
biological samples consisted of organ pools from the 3 above physiological 
systems obtained of farms from 3 important producing regions: midwest, 
northeast, and south. Infectious bronchitis virus was detected by 
reverse-transcription, real-time PCR of the 5' untranslated region. The results 
showed 179 IBV-positive flocks (41.4% of the flocks), with 107 (24.8%) from 
broilers and 72 (16.8%) from breeders. There were similar frequencies of 
IBV-positive flocks in farms from different regions of the country, most often 
in broilers (average 54%) compared with breeders (average 30.8%). 
reverse-transcription was more frequently detected in the digestive system of 
breeders (40%), and in the digestive (43.5%) and respiratory (37.7%) systems of 
broilers. Infectious bronchitis virus genotyping was performed by a 
reverse-transcription nested PCR and sequencing of the S1 gene from a selection 
of 79 IBV-positive flocks (45 from broilers and 34 from breeders). The majority 
of the flocks were infected with Brazilian variant genotype than with

the Brazilian variant (mainly in the enteric tract) in commercial poultry flocks

Here, we report the isolation of a type 1 porcine reproductive and respiratory 
syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain from a clinical outbreak of severe respiratory 
problems and high fever. Next-generation sequencing was used to determine the 
complete genome sequence of the isolate (9625/2012). The virus belongs to a new 
branch within subtype 1, clade D, and shows the highest similarity to PRRSV 
Olot/1991 and to the Amervac vaccine strain. Mutation analysis of 9625/2012 
revealed no evidence of recombination but did show a high proportion of amino 
acid substitutions in the putative neutralizing epitopes, suggesting an 
important role of selective immune pressure in the evolution of PRRSV 9625/2012.

Two Amino Acid Changes at the N-Terminus of Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus Spike Protein Result in the Loss of Enteric Tropism,"1. Virology. 1997 Jan 20;227(2):378-88. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.8344.

Two amino acid changes at the N-terminus of transmissible gastroenteritis 
coronavirus spike protein result in the loss of enteric tropism.

Autónoma,Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain.

To study the molecular basis of TGEV tropism, a collection of recombinants 
between the PUR46-MAD strain of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) 
infecting the enteric and respiratory tracts and the PTV strain, which only 
infects the respiratory tract, was generated. The recombinant isolation 
frequency was about 10(-9) recombinants per nucleotide and was 3.7-fold higher 
at the 5'-end of the S gene than in other areas of the genome. Thirty 
recombinants were plaque purified and characterized phenotypically and 
genetically. All recombinant viruses had a single crossover and had inherited 
the 5'- and 3'-halves of their genome from the enteric and respiratory parents, 
respectively. Recombinant viruses were classified into three groups, named 1 to 
3, according to the location of the crossover. Group 1 recombinants had the 
crossover in the S gene, while in Groups 2 and 3 the crossovers were located in 
ORF1b and ORF1a, respectively. The tropism of the recombinants was studied. 
Recombinants of Group 1 had enteric and respiratory tropism, while Group 2 
recombinants infected the respiratory, but not the enteric, tract. Viruses of 
both groups differed by two nucleotide changes at positions 214 and 655. Both 
changes may be in principle responsible for the loss of enteric tropism but only 
the change in nucleotide 655 was specifically found in the respiratory isolates 
and most likely this single nucleotide change, which leads to a substitution in 
amino acid 219 of the S protein, was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism 
in the closely related PUR46 isolates. The available data indicate that in order 
to infect enteric tract cells with TGEV, two different domains of the S protein, 
mapping between amino acids 522 and 744 and around amino acid 219, respectively, 
are involved. The first domain binds to porcine aminopeptidase N, the cellular 
receptor for TGEV. In the other domain maps a second factor of undefined nature 
but which may be the binding site for a coreceptor essential for the enteric 
tropism of TGEV.

Investigation of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in the Mbala and Kazungula districts of Zambia,"<jats:p>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, highly contagious viral infection of domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals. It is known to be endemic in Zambia, with periodic outbreaks occurring in different geographical areas of the country. This study was conducted to investigate the presence of FMD virus (FMDV) in reported FMD-suspected cases in cattle from the Kazungula and Mbala districts of Zambia. Sixty epithelial tissues or oesophageal-pharyngeal (OP) scrapings (probang samples) were collected from Mbala (n = 51) and Kazungula (n = 9) and examined for FMDV. The FMDV viral RNA and serotypes were examined by realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and antigen Enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Twenty-two samples (36.7%) were positive for the FMDV genome by qRT-PCR with Cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 13 to 31. The FMDV-positive samples from epithelial tissues showed relatively higher Ct values compared to those obtained from OP scrapings, irrespective of geographical location. Forty percent (40%; n = 4) of epithelial tissues from Mbala were serotyped into SAT 2 serotype by antigen ELISA. Kazungula samples were serotyped into SAT 1. These findings indicated that Mbala and Kazungula districts had FMD outbreaks in 2012 that were ascribed to at least FMDV serotype SAT 2 and SAT 1 field strains. Furthermore, regular interaction between buffalos from the Mosi-o Tunya Park and domestic animals from surrounding areas could contribute to the occurrence of regular FMD outbreaks in Kazungula, whilst the uncontrolled animal movements across borders between Mbala and Nsumbawanga could be responsible for disease outbreaks in Mbala. In-depth molecular biological studies, including sequencing and phylogeny of the viruses, should be conducted to elucidate the complex epidemiology of FMD in Zambia, thereby providing valuable information needed for the rational control strategy of FMD in Zambia and neighbouring countries.</jats:p>",0
Isolation and Metagenomic Identification of Avian Leukosis Virus Associated with Mortality in Broiler Chicken,"<jats:p>Avian leukosis virus (ALV) belongs to the family Retroviridae and causes considerable economic losses to the poultry industry. Following an outbreak associated with high mortality in a broiler flock in northern part of Malaysia, kidney tissues from affected chickens were submitted for virus isolation and identification in chicken embryonated egg and MDCK cells. Evidence of virus growth was indicated by haemorrhage and embryo mortality in egg culture. While viral growth in cell culture was evidenced by the development of cytopathic effects. The isolated virus was purified by sucrose gradient and identified using negative staining transmission electron microscopy. Further confirmation was achieved through next-generation sequencing and nucleotide sequence homology search. Analysis of the viral sequences using the NCBI BLAST tool revealed 99-100% sequence homology with exogenous ALV viral envelope protein. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial envelope sequences showed the Malaysian isolate clustered with Taiwanese and Japanese ALV strains, which were closer to ALV subgroup J, ALV subgroup E, and recombinant A/E isolates. Based on these findings, ALV was concluded to be associated with the present outbreak. It was recommended that further studies should be conducted on the molecular epidemiology and pathogenicity of the identified virus isolate.</jats:p>",0

Avipoxviruses are emerging pathogens affecting over 200 bird species worldwide. 
Genetic characterization of avipoxviruses is performed by analysis of genomic 
regions encoding the 4b and DNA polymerase. Whole genome sequence data are 
limited to a few avipoxvirus isolates. Based on phylogenetic analysis three 
major genetic clades are distinguished. In this study we report a novel 
avipoxvirus strain causing skin lesions in domestic turkey. The virus was 
identified in Hungary during 2011 in a flock of turkey vaccinated against 
avipoxvirus infection. The genome of the isolated strain, TKPV-HU1124/2011, was 
uniquely short (∼188.5kbp) and was predicted to encode reduced number of 
proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes encoding the 4b and DNA polymerase 
separated TKPV-HU1124/2011 from other turkey origin avipoxviruses and classified 
it into a new genetic clade. This study permits new insight into the genetic and 
genomic heterogeneity of avipoxviruses and pinpoints the importance of strain 
diversity in vaccine efficacy.

Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly contagious disease, 
peste des petits ruminants (PPR), in sheep and goats which has been considered 
as a serious threat to the local economy in Africa and Asia. However, the 
in-depth evolutionary dynamics of PPRV during an epidemic is not well 
understood. We conducted phylogenetic analysis on genomic sequences of 25 PPRV 
strains from China 2013-2014 outbreaks. All these strains clustered into a novel 
clade in lineage 4. An evolutionary rate of 2.61 × 10-6 nucleotide substitutions 
per site per day was estimated, dating the most recent common ancestor of PPRV 
China 2013-2014 strains to early August 2013. Transmission network analysis 
revealed that all the virus sequences could be grouped into five clusters of 
infection, suggesting long-distance animal transmission play an important role 
in the spread of PPRV in China. These results expanded our knowledge for PPRV 
evolution to achieve effective control measures.

Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an important viral disease of sheep and 
goats. The wildlife hosts of PPR, which may play an important role in the 
epidemiology of this disease, are not well characterized. The research was 
undertaken to study the infection of PPR virus (PPRV) in free-living bharals 
(Pseudois nayaur) in Tibet, China. In 2007, PPRV infection was confirmed in two 
bharals in Rutog County of Tibet based on clinical signs and detection of PPRV 
RNA in tissue samples. In 2008, PPRV infection was found in one bharal in 
Ge'gyai County of Tibet by competitive ELISA, reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction, and sequence analysis of PPRV fusion protein (F) and 
nucleoprotein (N) gene segments. The PPRV variant identified in infected bharal 
was closely related to other circulating PPRV variants recently identified in 
sheep and goats from Tibet. This is the first report of PPRV infection in 
free-living bharals.

Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), classified as a gammaretrovirus, has a 
variety of hosts, including chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and wild birds. REV 
causes a series of pathological syndromes, especially the immunosuppression of 
the host, which may lead to an increased susceptibility to other pathogens, thus 
greatly damaging the poultry industry. Mixed infections of REV and Marek's 
disease virus (MDV) have been reported in many countries, including China. 
Previous reports revealed that MDV vaccines were not efficacious, and even 
less-virulent MDV strains would cause some losses due to mixed infections with 
REV. Additionally, contaminants in the MDV vaccine might be the main source of 
REV. In this study, two clinical samples were collected from two flocks of 
chickens that were diagnosed with MDV. Subsequently, two REV isolates were 
obtained from the clinical samples. The isolates, named CY1111 and SY1209, were 
further confirmed through an indirect immunofluorescence assay and electron 
microscopy. Complete genome sequences of the two REV strains were determined to 
test the relationship between them and other REV strains. Phylogenetic trees 
showed that the two REV strains were closely related to most REV strains that 
were isolated from a variety of hosts. Therefore, REVs might spread freely among 
these hosts under natural conditions. Additionally, most REV strains in China 
were in the same clade. The present work offers some information regarding REV 
in China.

BACKGROUND: Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are responsible 
for the biological transmission of internationally important arboviruses of 
livestock. In 2011, a novel Orthobunyavirus was discovered in northern Europe 
causing congenital malformations and abortions in ruminants. From field studies, 
Culicoides were implicated in the transmission of this virus which was 
subsequently named Schmallenberg virus (SBV), but to date no assessment of 
susceptibility to infection of field populations under standardised laboratory 
conditions has been carried out. We assessed the influence of membrane type 
(chick skin, collagen, Parafilm M®) when offered in conjunction with an 
artificial blood-feeding system (Hemotek, UK) on field-collected Culicoides 
blood-feeding rates. Susceptibility to infection with SBV following 
blood-feeding on an SBV-blood suspension provided via either (i) the Hemotek 
system or via (ii) a saturated cotton wool pledglet was then compared. 
Schmallenberg virus susceptibility was defined by RT-qPCR of RNA extractions of 
head homogenates and related to Culicoides species and haplotype identifications 
based on the DNA barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 
(cox1) gene.
RESULTS: Culicoides blood-feeding rates were low across all membrane types 
tested (7.5% chick skin, 0.0% for collagen, 4.4% Parafilm M®, with 6029 female 
Culicoides being offered a blood meal in total). Susceptibility to infection 
with SBV through membrane blood-feeding (8 of 109 individuals tested) and 
pledglet blood-feeding (1 of 94 individuals tested) was demonstrated for the 
Obsoletus complex, with both C. obsoletus (Meigen) and C. scoticus Downes & 
Kettle susceptible to infection with SBV through oral feeding. Potential 
evidence of cryptic species within UK populations was found for the Obsoletus 
complex in phylogenetic analyses of cox1 DNA barcodes of 74 individuals assessed 
from a single field-site.
CONCLUSIONS: Methods described in this study provide the means to blood-feed 
Palaearctic Culicoides for vector competence studies and colonisation attempts. 
Susceptibility to SBV infection was 7.3% for membrane-fed members of the 
subgenus Avaritia and 1.1% for pledglet-fed. Both C. obsoletus and C. scoticus 
were confirmed as being susceptible to infection with SBV, with potential 
evidence of cryptic species within UK Obsoletus complex specimens, however the 
implications of cryptic diversity in the Obsoletus complex on arbovirus 
transmission remains unknown.

Until now, the only published ovine adenovirus DNA sequence was the complete 
genome of ovine adenovirus isolate 287 (OAV287) which, compared to other 
mammalian adenoviruses, possesses strikingly unique genomic organisation and 
should properly be classified into a new adenovirus genus. The protease gene 
sequence of ovine adenovirus type 3 (OAdV-3) was determined and analysed. The 
results of phylogenetic analysis of the 205 residue long protein demonstrated 
that OAdV-3 belongs to the genus Mastadenovirus, and is surprisingly closely 
related to bovine adenovirus type 2. In spite of the common host origin, the 
evolutionary distance between OAdV-3 and OAV287 proved to be great suggesting 
that sheep, similarly to cattle and fowl, might be infected by distantly related 
adenoviruses belonging to different genera.

We have cloned and sequenced the entire M gene of the vaccine strain of 
rinderpest virus and that of the virulent Kabete ""O"" strain from which it was 
derived. The sequences of these two genes are essentially identical (99% at the 
nucleotide level), but were very different from a previously published Kabete O 
M gene sequence (M. Limo and T. Yilma, 1990, Virology 175, 323-327). Inspection 
of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of known morbillivirus M 
genes showed that the earlier sequence was clearly from a morbillivirus, but 
neither from rinderpest virus nor from peste des petits ruminants virus.

Sporadic fatal outbreaks of disease in humans and non-human primates caused by 
Ebola or Marburg viruses have driven research into the characterization of these 
viruses with the hopes of identifying host tropisms and potential reservoirs. 
Such an understanding of the relatedness of newly discovered filoviruses may 
help to predict risk factors for outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in humans 
and/or non-human primates. Recent discoveries such as three distinct genotypes 
of Reston ebolavirus, unexpectedly discovered in domestic swine in the 
Philippines; as well as a new species, Bundibugyo ebolavirus; the recent 
discovery of Lloviu virus as a potential new genus, Cuevavirus, within 
Filoviridae; and germline integrations of filovirus-like sequences in some 
animal species bring new insights into the relatedness of filoviruses, their 
prevalence and potential for transmission to humans. These new findings reveal 
that filoviruses are more diverse and may have had a greater influence on the 
evolution of animals than previously thought. Herein we review these findings 
with regard to the implications for understanding the host range, prevalence and 
transmission of Filoviridae.

After 44 years of epidemiological silence, bluetongue virus (BTV) was 
reintroduced in Portugal in the autumn of 2004. The first clinical cases of 
bluetongue disease (BT) were notified in sheep farms located in the South of 
Portugal, close to the Spanish border. A total of six BTV, five of serotype 4 
and one of serotype 2 were isolated from sheep and cattle during the 2004-2006 
epizootics. The nucleotide sequence of gene segments L2, S7 and S10 of BTV-4 
prototype strain (BTV4/22045/PT04) obtained from the initial outbreak and of 
BTV-2 (BTV2/26629/PT05) was fully determined and compared with those from other 
parts of the world. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that BTV4/22045/PT04 is 
related to other BTV-4 strains that circulate in the Mediterranean basin since 
1998, showing the highest identity (99%) with BTV-4 isolates of 2003 from 
Sardinia and Corsica, whereas BTV2/26629/PT05 is almost indistinguishable from 
the Onderstepoort BTV-2 live-attenuated vaccine strain and its related field 
strain isolated in Italy. Since live-attenuated BTV-2 vaccine was never used in 
Portugal, the isolation of this strain may represent a natural circulation of 
the vaccine virus used in other countries in Mediterranean Europe.

Infection of macrophages by a lymphotropic herpesvirus: a new tropism for Marek's disease virus,"<jats:p>Marek's disease virus (MDV) is classified as an oncogenic lymphotropic herpesvirus of chickens. MDV productively and cytolytically infects B,<jats:italic>αβ</jats:italic>T and<jats:italic>γδ</jats:italic>T lymphocytes and latently infects T-helper lymphocytes. The aims of this study were to identify whether MDV infects macrophages<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>and, if so, whether quantitative differences in macrophage infection are associated with MDV strain virulence. Chickens were infected with either virulent MDV (HPRS-16) or ‘hypervirulent’ MDV (C12/130). Flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies recognizing MDV pp38 antigen and leukocyte antigens was used to identify MDV lytically infected cells. Macrophages from HPRS-16- and C12/130-infected chickens were pp38<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>. It is demonstrated that macrophages are pp38<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>because they are infected and not because they have phagocytosed MDV antigens, as assessed by confocal microscopy using antibodies recognizing MDV antigens of the three herpesvirus kinetic classes: infected cell protein 4 (ICP4, immediate early), pp38 (early) and glycoprotein B (gB, late). Spleen macrophages from MDV-infected chickens were ICP4<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, pp38<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>and gB<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, and ICP4 had nuclear localization denoting infection.

Tick-borne viruses.

Bartíková P, Holíková V, Kazimírová M, Štibrániová I.

Tick-borne viruses (TBVs) belong to the largest biological group known as 
arboviruses with unique mode of transmission by blood-feeding arthropods (ticks, 
mosquitoes, sand flies, biting midges, etc.) to a susceptible vertebrate host. 
Taxonomically, it is a heterogenous group of vertebrate viruses found in several 
viral families. With only one exception, African swine fever virus, all TBVs 
have a RNA genome. To date, at least 160 tick-borne viruses are known, some of 
them pose a significant threat to human and animal health worldwide. Recently, a 
number of established TBVs has re-emerged and spread to new geographic locations 
due to the influence of anthropogenic activities and few available vaccines. 
Moreover, new emerging tick-borne diseases are constantly being reported. Major 
advances in molecular biotechnologies have led to discoveries of new TBVs and 
further genetic characterization of unclassified viruses resulting in changes in 
TBVs classification created by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of 
Viruses. Although TBVs spend over 95% of their life cycle within tick vectors 
and the role of ticks as vectors has been known for over 100 years, our 
knowledge about TBVs and molecular processes involved in the virus-tick 
interactions is scarce.

During 2008-2009, several human cases of WNV disease caused by an endemic 
lineage 1a strain were reported in areas surrounding the Po river in 
north-eastern Italy. Since 2010, cases have been recorded in nearby northern 
areas, where, in 2011, both lineage 1a and 2 were detected. We describe here two 
new WNV complete genome sequences from human cases of WNV infection occurring in 
2011 in the Veneto Region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that both genome 
sequences belonged to lineage 1a and were related to WNV strains of the Western 
Mediterranean subtype. The novel WNV genomes had high nucleotide and amino acid 
sequence divergence from each other and from the WNV strain circulating in Italy 
in 2008-2009. The presence of different WNV strains in a relatively small 
geographical area is a novel finding with unpredictable impact on human disease 
that requires further investigation.

Swine are an important intermediate host for emergence of pandemic influenza. 
Vietnam is the largest swine producer in South East Asia. Systematic virological 
and serological surveillance of swine influenza viruses was carried out in 
Northern Vietnam from May 2013 to June 2014 with monthly sampling of pigs in 
local and large collective slaughterhouses and in a live pig market. Influenza A 
seroprevalence in the local slaughterhouses and in the large collective 
slaughterhouse was 48.7% and 29.1%, respectively. Seventy-seven influenza A 
viruses were isolated, all from the large collective slaughterhouse. Genetic 
analysis revealed six virus genotypes including H1N1 2009 pandemic (H1N1pdm09) 
viruses, H1N2 with H1 of human origin, H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 reassortants, and 
triple-reassortant H3N2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of swine and human 
H1N1pdm09 viruses showed evidence of repeated spill-over from humans to swine 
rather than the establishment of H1N1pdm09 as long-term distinct lineage in 
swine. Surveillance at the large collective slaughterhouse proved to be the most 
efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable method of surveillance for swine 
influenza viruses in Vietnam.

Papillomaviruses are a diverse group of viruses that are known to infect a wide 
range of animal species. Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are divided into at 
least 21 genotypes (BPV1 to BPV21),  with most BPV isolates/strains described to 
date belonging to one of four genera, including Deltapapillomavirus, 
Xipapillomavirus, Epsilonpapillomavirus and Dyoxipapillomavirus. Here, we 
describe the identification and genetic characterization of a new BPV type in 
the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. A farm in the state of New York, USA, reported 
chronic cases of vulvovaginitis in Holstein cows in 2016. Biopsies and/or swab 
samples collected from the vaginal mucosa were subjected to diagnostic 
investigation. Conventional diagnostic assays yielded negative results, and 
vaginal swab samples were subjected to viral metagenomic sequencing. Notably, 
BLAST searches revealed a papillomavirus genome with 7480 bp in length (67% nt 
sequence identity to BPV16). Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene 
of the papillomavirus identified here (tentatively named BPV22) revealed that it 
clusters with members of the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. Interestingly, the 
recently identified BPV16, which was detected in fibropapilloma lesions in 
cattle also clusters within the Dyokappapapillomavirus group. Each virus, 
however, forms a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree. These results 
indicate that the putative BPV22 represents the second BPV within the genus 
Dyokappapapillomavirus.

A metagenomic analysis of live human vaccines has recently demonstrated the 
presence of porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) DNA in the paediatric vaccine 
Rotarix used in the prevention of acute gastroenteritis. Using real-time PCR for 
PCV1, titres of PCV1 DNA in several batches of Rotarix were found to be in the 
order of 6-7 log(10) copies per dose. Pre-treatment of the reconstituted vaccine 
with the nuclease Benzonase, followed by extraction of nucleic acid and 
quantification of PCV1 DNA by real-time PCR, revealed that there was no loss of 
PCV1 DNA titre compared to untreated controls, suggesting that the porcine viral 
DNA was present in the vaccine in an encapsidated form. PCV1 permissive PS 
cells, human HEK293 and Vero cells, used for vaccine production, were infected 
with Rotarix or PCV1, respectively, and subjected to immune fluorescence and 
RT-PCR. Viral genomes were present in Rotarix-incubated as well as PCV1-infected 
cells, while viral transcription was seen only in PCV1-infected cells. 
Similarly, PCV1-specific protein expression was observed in PCV1-infected cells, 
but not in cells treated with Rotarix. Passaging of the supernatant indicated 
productive infection in PCV1-infected PS cells, but not in HEK293 and Vero cells 
or in any cell line incubated with Rotarix. PCV1 DNA present in Rotarix was 
protected from Benzonase digestion; however, PCV1 was not recognized in immune 
electron microscopy and unable to infect PS, HEK293 or Vero cells, suggesting 
that the high amount of PCV1 DNA present in Rotarix does not reflect a 
corresponding proportion of biologically active virus particles.

diarrhea viruses isolated from a bovid affected by mucosal disease were 
determined by next generation sequencing. The cytopathic virus possessed a 
423-base insertion derived from bovine poly ubiquitin in the NS2/3 coding region 
and one nucleotide change. Both biotypes showed an additional glycosylation site 
in their N-terminus.

Prompt and accurate diagnosis is warranted for infectious diseases of domestic 
animals which may have a significant impact on animal production or clinical 
practice. In this study, the identification and genetic characterization of a 
bovine enterovirus (BEV) strain isolated from a calf with diarrhea, are 
described. Two different next generation sequencing platforms were employed. 
Shotgun metagenomic accomplished by MinION sequencing (Oxford Nanopore 
Technologies) allowed the identification of BEV RNA from a cell-culture isolate. 
BEV was then confirmed by a specific real time RT-PCR assay. To achieve the 
whole genome of this isolate, sequence reads obtained by MinION were coupled 
with those originating from NextSeq500 (Illumina). Genomic relatedness and 
phylogeny with extant BEV strains is also reported. Overall, this manuscript 
highlights the use of the portable MinION sequence technology as a tool for 
support diagnostics in veterinary practice.

Currently, the genus Pestivirus comprises the four approved species Bovine viral 
diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and 
Border disease virus (BDV) and one tentative fifth species represented by a 
single strain (H138) isolated from a giraffe in Kenya more than 30 years ago. To 
further address the issue of heterogeneity of pestiviruses we have determined 
the entire N(pro) and E2 coding sequences for several new pestivirus isolates. 
Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that one pestivirus isolated in 
the 1990s in Africa is closely related to strain H138. Moreover, several novel 
pestiviruses isolated from sheep group together with the previously described 
strain V60 (Reindeer-1) isolated from a reindeer, whereas one ovine pestivirus 
strain (Gifhorn) significantly differs from all previously described 
pestiviruses, including BDV. We propose to term these mainly sheep-derived 
pestiviruses BDV-2 (V60-like isolates) and BDV-3 (Gifhorn); consequently, the 
""classical"" BDV isolates should be termed BDV-1. As an additional criterion for 
segregation of pestiviruses, the antigenic relatedness of pestivirus isolates 
covering all observed major genotypes was studied by cross-neutralization 
assays. Analysis of the antigenic similarities indicated the presence of seven 
major antigenic groups corresponding to BVDV-1, BVDV-2, CSFV, BDV-1, BDV-2, 
BDV-3, and ""giraffe"". Taking into account the host origin, the lack of 
differences concerning the course of disease, and the results of our genetic and 
antigenic analyses, we suggest that BDV-1, BDV-2, and BDV-3 should be considered 
as major genotypes within the species BDV.

‘Schmallenberg virus’ – a novel orthobunyavirus emerging in Europe,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>In 2011, a novel orthobunyavirus of the Simbu serogroup, the Schmallenberg virus (SBV), was discovered using a metagenomic approach. SBV caused a large epidemic in Europe in ruminants. As with related viruses such as Akabane virus, it appears to be transmitted by biting midges. Transplacental infection often results in the birth of malformed calves, lambs and goat kids. In more than 5000 farms in Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, UK, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Denmark and Switzerland acute infections of adult ruminants or malformed SBV-positive offspring were detected, and high seroprevalences were seen in adult ruminants in the core regions in The Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The discovery of SBV, the spread of the epidemic, the role of vectors, the impact on livestock, public health issues, SBV diagnosis and measures taken are described in this review. Lessons to be learned from the Schmallenberg virus epidemic and the consequences for future outbreaks are discussed.</jats:p>",0

Multiple Reassorted Viruses as Cause of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza 
A(H5N8) Virus Epidemic, the Netherlands, 2016.

Beerens N, Heutink R, Bergervoet SA, Harders F, Bossers A, Koch G.

In 2016, an epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H5N8 
in the Netherlands caused mass deaths among wild birds, and several commercial 
poultry farms and captive bird holdings were affected. We performed complete 
genome sequencing to study the relationship between the wild bird and poultry 
viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses are related to H5 clade 
2.3.4.4 viruses detected in Russia in May 2016 but contained novel polymerase 
basic 2 and nucleoprotein gene segments and 2 different variants of the 
polymerase acidic segment. Molecular dating suggests that the reassortment 
events most likely occurred in wild birds in Russia or Mongolia. Furthermore, 2 
genetically distinct H5N5 reassortant viruses were detected in wild birds in the 
Netherlands. Our study provides evidence for fast and continuing reassortment of 
H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses, which might lead to rapid changes in virus 
characteristics, such as pathogenicity, infectivity, transmission, and zoonotic 
potential.

In our world, which is faced today with exceptional environmental changes and 
dramatically intensifying globalisation, we are encountering challenges due to 
many new factors, including the emergence or re-emergence of novel, so far 
""unknown"" infectious diseases. Although a broad arsenal of diagnostic methods is 
at our disposal, the majority of the conventional diagnostic tests is highly 
virus-specific or is targeted entirely towards a limited group of infectious 
agents. This specificity complicates or even hinders the detection of new or 
unexpected pathogens, such as new, emerging or re-emerging viruses or novel 
viral variants. The recently developed approaches of viral metagenomics provide 
an effective novel way to screen samples and detect viruses without previous 
knowledge of the infectious agent, thereby enabling a better diagnosis and 
disease control, in line with the ""One World, One Health"" principles 
(www.oneworldonehealth.org). Using metagenomic approaches, we have recently 
identified a broad variety of new viruses, such as novel bocaviruses, Torque 
Teno viruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses and kobuviruses in porcine disease 
syndromes, new virus variants in honeybee populations, as well as a range of 
other infectious agents in further host species. These findings indicate that 
the metagenomic detection of viral pathogens is becoming now a powerful, 
cultivation-independent, and useful novel diagnostic tool in veterinary 
diagnostic virology.

The early and rapid detection and characterization of specific nucleic acids of 
medico-veterinary pathogens have proven invaluable for diagnostic purposes. The 
integration of amplification and signal detection systems, including online 
real-time devices, have increased speed and sensitivity and greatly facilitated 
the quantification of target nucleic acids. They have also allowed for sequence 
characterization using melting or hybridization curves. The newer-generation 
molecular diagnostic technologies offer, hitherto, unparalleled detection and 
discrimination methodologies, which are vital for the positive detection and 
identification of pathogenic agents, as well as the effects of the pathogens on 
the production of antibodies. The development phase of the novel technologies 
entails a thorough understanding of accurate diagnosis and discrimination of 
present and emerging diseases. The development of novel technologies can only be 
successful if they are transferred and used in the field with a sustainable 
quality-assured application to allow for the optimal detection and effective 
control of diseases. The aim of these new tools is to detect the presence of a 
pathogen agent before the onset of disease. This manuscript focuses mainly on 
the experiences of two World Organisation for Animal Health collaborating 
centers in context to molecular diagnosis and molecular epidemiology of 
transboundary and endemic animal diseases of viral origin, food safety and 
zoonoses.

Pan-viral DNA array (PVDA) and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) are useful tools 
to identify novel viruses of emerging diseases. However, both techniques have 
difficulties to identify viruses in clinical samples because of the host genomic 
nucleic acid content (hg/cont). Both propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium 
bromide monoazide (EMA) have the capacity to bind free DNA/RNA, but are cell 
membrane-impermeable. Thus, both are unable to bind protected nucleic acid such 
as viral genomes within intact virions. However, EMA/PMA modified genetic 
material cannot be amplified by enzymes. In order to assess the potential of 
EMA/PMA to lower the presence of amplifiable hg/cont in samples and improve 
virus detection, serum and lung tissue homogenates were spiked with porcine 
reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) and were processed with EMA/PMA. In 
addition, PRRSV RT-qPCR positive clinical samples were also tested. EMA/PMA 
treatments significantly decreased amplifiable hg/cont and significantly 
increased the number of PVDA positive probes and their signal intensity compared 
to untreated spiked lung samples. EMA/PMA treatments also increased the 
sensitivity of HTS by increasing the number of specific PRRSV reads and the 
PRRSV percentage of coverage. Interestingly, EMA/PMA treatments significantly 
increased the sensitivity of PVDA and HTS in two out of three clinical tissue 
samples. Thus, EMA/PMA treatments offer a new approach to lower the amplifiable 
hg/cont in clinical samples and increase the success of PVDA and HTS to identify 
viruses.

Gerna, M. Battaglia, G. Milenesi, N. Passarani, E. Percivalle, and E. Cattaneo, Infect. Immun. 43:722-729, 1984). Three strains from beef herds were related to the UK and NCDV bovine rotavirus strains defined as serotype 6 (Y. Hoshino, R. G. Wyatt, H. B. Greenberg, J. Flores, and A. Z. Kapikian, J. Infect. Dis. 149:694-702, 1984). Two other strains from dairy herds were classified as bovine viruses related to the bovine B223 strain reported by Woode and co-workers (G. N. Woode, N. E. Kelso, T. F. Simpson, S. K. Gaul, L. E. Evans, and L. Babiuk, J. Clin. Microbiol. 18:358-364, 1983) in the United States. A serotyping antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunoassay to detect serotype 6 rotavirus using a serotype 6-specific monoclonal antibody was developed and evaluated for strain characterization. Characterization of 72 group A rotavirus-positive fecal samples from beef herds and 43 fecal samples from dairy herds showed a predominance of serotype 6 rotavirus in beef herds but both serotype 6 and non-serotype 6 rotaviruses in dairy herds. Analysis of genomic double-stranded RNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that when outbreaks were caused by one serotype only a single electropherotype was present in all samples.</jats:p>",0
Genotype Diversity of Newcastle Disease Virus in Nigeria: Disease Control Challenges and Future Outlook,"<jats:p>Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most important avian diseases with considerable threat to the productivity of poultry all over the world. The disease is associated with severe respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological lesions in chicken leading to high mortality and several other production related losses. The aetiology of the disease is an avian paramyxovirus type-1 or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), whose isolates are serologically grouped into a single serotype but genetically classified into a total of 19 genotypes, owing to the continuous emergence and evolution of the virus. In Nigeria, molecular characterization of NDV is generally very scanty and majorly focuses on the amplification of the partial F gene for genotype assignment. However, with the introduction of the most objective NDV genotyping criteria which utilize complete fusion protein coding sequences in phylogenetic taxonomy, the enormous genetic diversity of the virus in Nigeria became very conspicuous. In this review, we examine the current ecological distribution of various NDV genotypes in Nigeria based on the available complete fusion protein nucleotide sequences (1662 bp) in the NCBI database. We then discuss the challenges of ND control as a result of the wide genetic distance between the currently circulating NDV isolates and the commonest vaccines used to combat the disease in the country. Finally, we suggest future directions in the war against the economically devastating ND in Nigeria.</jats:p>",0
Molecular characterisation of epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus associated with a Tunisian outbreak among cattle in 2006,"<jats:p>In 2006, epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) outbreaks were recorded in the Maghreb (Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria) among cattle, resulting in severe repercussions on herds (oedema of the head, necrotic lesions of the oral mucosa, hyperthermia of the teats, accompanied by anorexia and respiratory distress) and economic losses. The present study gives new information on the molecular characterisation of the EHD virus (EHDV) that had circulated in Tunisia. Genome segments 2, 3, 6, 7 and 10 of EHDV, corresponding to the VP2, VP3, VP5, VP7 and NS3/NS3A proteins, respectively, were amplified from the blood of one animal by RT-PCR and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence comparisons of these five segments with sequences available in the GenBank demonstrated that an EHDV serotype 6 (EHDV-6) had been present in Tunisia in 2006. The possible origin of this strain is discussed.</jats:p>",0

Influenza A (H5N1) viruses infected humans in Hong Kong between May and 
December, 1997. Sixteen viruses, including 6 from fatal cases, were isolated 
during this outbreak. Molecular analysis of the surface proteins genes encoding 
the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of these H5N1 isolates, of a 
subtype not previously known to infect humans, are presented. The 16 human H5 HA 
sequences contain multiple basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site, a 
motif associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. The 
phylogenetic relationship among both avian and human H5 hemagglutinins indicates 
that the human isolates are related directly to isolates that circulated among 
chickens in the live poultry markets in Hong Kong prior to and during the 
outbreak in humans. HA sequences from the human isolates and a recent chicken 
isolate represent a separate clade, within which there are two subgroups that 
are distinguishable antigenically and by the presence of a potential 
glycosylation site. Likewise the N1 neuraminidases of the human H5 isolates 
represent a clade that is evolutionarily distinct from previously characterized 
N1 neuraminidases. The recent human H5N1 virus NA genes are avian-like, 
indicating direct introduction from an avian source rather than evolution of a 
human N1 NA. All of the 16 human NA genes encode a shortened stalk due to a 
19-amino acid deletion, also found in the recent avian H5N1 isolates from Hong 
Kong. Two unique amino acids were identified in the N1 NAs of the recent human 
isolates; however, it is not known if these residues influence host range. 
Neither the HA nor the NA genes of the human H5N1 virus isolates show evidence 
of adaptive changes during the outbreak. Although analyses of the surface 
protein genes of the H5N1 viruses from this outbreak did not provide immediate 
answers regarding the molecular basis for virulence, the analyses provided clues 
to potentially important areas of the genes worth further investigation.

Analysis of the Variability in the Non-Coding Regions of Influenza A Viruses,"<jats:p>The genomes of influenza A viruses (IAVs) comprise eight negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments. In addition to the protein-coding region, each segment possesses 5′ and 3′ non-coding regions (NCR) that are important for transcription, replication and packaging. The NCRs contain both conserved and segment-specific sequences, and the impacts of variability in the NCRs are not completely understood. Full NCRs have been determined from some viruses, but a detailed analysis of potential variability in these regions among viruses from different host groups and locations has not been performed. To evaluate the degree of conservation in NCRs among different viruses, we sequenced the NCRs of IAVs isolated from different wild bird host groups (ducks, gulls and seabirds). We then extended our study to include NCRs available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Influenza Virus Database, which allowed us to analyze a wider variety of host species and more HA and NA subtypes. We found that the amount of variability within the NCRs varies among segments, with the greatest variation found in the HA and NA and the least in the M and NS segments. Overall, variability in NCR sequences was correlated with the coding region phylogeny, suggesting vertical coevolution of the (coding sequence) CDS and NCR regions.</jats:p>",0

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most important tick-borne viral 
disease of humans, causing sporadic cases or outbreaks of severe illness across 
a huge geographic area, from western China to the Middle East and southeastern 
Europe and throughout most of Africa. CCHFV is maintained in vertical and 
horizontal transmission cycles involving ixodid ticks and a variety of wild and 
domestic vertebrates, which do not show signs of illness. The virus circulates 
in a number of tick genera, but Hyalomma ticks are the principal source of human 
infection, probably because both immature and adult forms actively seek hosts 
for the blood meals required at each stage of maturation. CCHF occurs most 
frequently among agricultural workers following the bite of an infected tick, 
and to a lesser extent among slaughterhouse workers exposed to the blood and 
tissues of infected livestock and medical personnel through contact with the 
body fluids of infected patients. CCHFV is the most genetically diverse of the 
arboviruses, with nucleotide sequence differences among isolates ranging from 
20% for the viral S segment to 31% for the M segment. Viruses with diverse 
sequences can be found within the same geographic area, while closely related 
viruses have been isolated in far distant regions, suggesting that widespread 
dispersion of CCHFV has occurred at times in the past, possibly by ticks carried 
on migratory birds or through the international livestock trade. Reassortment 
among genome segments during co-infection of ticks or vertebrates appears to 
have played an important role in generating diversity, and represents a 
potential future source of novel viruses. In this article, we first review 
current knowledge of CCHFV, summarizing its molecular biology, maintenance and 
transmission, epidemiology and geographic range. We also include an extensive 
discussion of CCHFV genetic diversity, including maps of the range of the virus 
with superimposed phylogenetic trees. We then review the features of CCHF, 
including the clinical syndrome, diagnosis, treatment, pathogenesis, vaccine 
development and laboratory animal models of CCHF. The paper ends with a 
discussion of the possible future geographic range of the virus. For the benefit 
of researchers, we include a Supplementary Table listing all published reports 
of CCHF cases and outbreaks in the English-language literature, plus some 
principal articles in other languages, with total case numbers, case fatality 
rates and all CCHFV strains on GenBank.

Camelpox virus (CMLV), a close variant of variola virus (VARV) infects camels 
worldwide. The zoonotic infections reported from India signify the need to study 
the host-range genes-responsible for host tropism. We report sequence and 
phylogenetic analysis of five host-range genes: cytokine response modifier B 
(crmB), chemokine binding protein (ckbp), viral schlafen-like (v-slfn), 
myxomavirus T4-like (M-T4-like) and b5r of CMLVs isolated from outbreaks in 
India. Comparative analysis revealed that these genes are conserved among CMLVs 
and shared 94.5-100 % identity at both nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) 
levels. All genes showed identity (59.3-98.4 %) with cowpox virus (CPXV) while 
three genes-crmB, ckbp and b5r showed similarity (92-96.5 %) with VARVs at both 
nt and aa levels. Interestingly, three consecutive serine residue insertions 
were observed in CKBP protein of CMLV-Delhi09 isolate which was similar to 
CPXV-BR and VACVs, besides five point mutations (K53Q, N67I, F84S, A127T and 
E182G) were also similar to zoonotic OPXVs. Further, few inconsistent point 
mutation(s) were also observed in other gene(s) among Indian CMLVs. These 
indicate that different strains of CMLVs are circulating in India and these 
mutations could play an important role in adaptation of CMLVs in humans. The 
phylogeny revealed clustering of all CMLVs together except CMLV-Delhi09 which 
grouped separately due to the presence of specific point mutations. However, the 
topology of the concatenated phylogeny showed close evolutionary relationship of 
CMLV with VARV and TATV followed by CPXV-RatGer09/1 from Germany. The 
availability of this genetic information will be useful in unveiling new 
strategies to control emerging zoonotic poxvirus infections.

Buffalopox virus (BPXV), a close variant of vaccinia virus (VACV) has emerged as 
a zoonotic pathogen. The host tropism of poxviruses is governed by host-range 
genes. Among the host-range genes: E3L, K3L, and C7L are essential for virus 
replication by preventing interferon resistance, whereas B5R is essential for 
spread of the virus and evasion from the host's immune response as in VACV. We 
report sequence analysis of host-range genes: E3L, K3L, C7L, and membrane 
protein gene (B5R) of BPXVs from buffalo, cattle, and human from recent 
outbreaks in India-their phylogenetic relationship with reference strain (BP4) 
and other Orthopoxviruses. BPXVs revealed a sequence homology with VACVs 
including zoonotic Brazilian VACV-like viruses. The aa sequences of E3L and K3L 
genes were 100 % similar in buffalo, cattle, and human isolates. However, four 
significant point mutations (I11K; N12K and S36F in C7L gene and D249G in B5R 
gene) were observed specific to buffalo isolate only. This signifies that 
different strains of BPXV were circulated during the outbreak. The mutations in 
C7L and B5R could play an important role in adaptation of BPXV in human and 
cattle which needs further functional studies. The strain of BPXV isolated from 
buffalo may not be adopted in human and cow. Various point mutations were 
observed in the host-range genes of reference strain (BPXV-BP4) which may be due 
to several passages of virus in cell culture. The phylogeny constructed based on 
concatenated gene sequences revealed that BPXVs are not as closely related to 
vaccine strain (Lister and Lister-derived strain-LC16m8), as hypothesized 
earlier, rather they are more closely related to reference strain (BPXV-BP4) and 
other vaccinia and vaccinia-like viruses such as Passatempo and Aracatuba 
viruses. The availability of information regarding host tropism determinants 
would allow us to understand molecular mechanism of species tropism of 
poxviruses which would be useful in unveiling new strategies to control zoonotic 
poxviral infections.

Sciences, Biomedical Center, Uppsala, Sweden.

Complementary DNA clones representing the fusion (F) protein gene of the porcine 
rubulavirus LPMV were isolated and sequenced. The F gene was found to be 1,845 
nucleotides long containing one long open reading frame capable of encoding a 
protein of 541 amino acids. The cleavage motif for F0 into F1 and F2 is 
His-Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg. A sequence comparison and a phylogenetic analysis was 
performed in order to identify possible functional domains of paramyxovirus 
fusion proteins and also to classify the porcine rubulavirus. The F gene of LPMV 
is most closely related to the human mumps virus and simian virus type 5 F 
genes, and is therefore classified into the rubulavirus genus. A coding region 
for a small hydrophobic protein was however not found between the F and 
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes as previously found in both SV5 and 
mumps.

Phage–bacteria relationships and CRISPR elements revealed by a metagenomic survey of the rumen microbiome,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play an important role in balancing microbes within an ecosystem and facilitating horizontal gene transfer. Although bacteriophages are abundant in rumen environments, little is known about the types of viruses present or their interaction with the rumen microbiome. We undertook random pyrosequencing of virus‐enriched metagenomes (viromes) isolated from bovine rumen fluid and analysed the resulting data using comparative metagenomics. A high level of diversity was observed with up to 28 000 different viral genotypes obtained from each environment. The majority (∼78%) of sequences did not match any previously described virus. Prophages outnumbered lytic phages approximately 2:1 with the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types being associated with members of the dominant rumen phyla (<jats:italic>Firmicutes</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Proteobacteria</jats:italic>). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed an enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. We expanded our analysis to include previously described metagenomic data and 14 reference genomes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were detected in most of the microbial genomes, suggesting previous interactions between viral and microbial communities.</jats:p>",0
Using noninvasive metagenomics to characterize viral communities from wildlife,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Microbial communities play an important role in organismal and ecosystem health. While high‐throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and limited quantities of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (<jats:italic>Desmodus rotundus</jats:italic>), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. Based on finding viral contamination in foetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or another nonbiological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low‐input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments and time.</jats:p>",0
Antigenic and genetic characterization of rabies viruses isolated from domestic and wild animals of Brazil identifies the hoary fox as a rabies reservoir,"<jats:p>Fifty Brazilian rabies viruses, collected from many different animal species and several regions of the country, were characterized by partial sequencing of the central, variable region of the <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> gene, a locus useful for sensitive molecular epidemiological studies. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences, which included comparison with other rabies strains recovered from throughout the Americas, identified three main groups of Brazilian viruses, arbitrarily designated BRL-1 to BRL-3. BRL-1 was found in terrestrial carnivores and clusters with other American strains of the cosmopolitan lineage. BRL-2 comprised two distinct isolates, recovered from two species of non-haematophagous bats, that had evolutionary links to insectivorous-bat-derived strains of North America. BRL-3 consisted of isolates from vampire bats and from livestock species probably infected via contact with vampire bats. The terrestrial group was further subdivided into three subtypes: BRL-1a was associated exclusively with dogs and cats, while BRL-1b and BRL-1c were found exclusively in hoary foxes. These observations strongly support the role of the Brazilian hoary fox as a rabies reservoir. Screening of representative Brazilian rabies viruses against a collection of anti-rabies monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified a small panel of mAbs that could be used to discriminate between all Brazilian subgroups as defined by genetic classification in this study.</jats:p>",0
"Human herpesvirus 7 is a T-lymphotropic virus and is related to, but significantly different from, human herpesvirus 6 and human cytomegalovirus.","<jats:p>An independent strain (JI) of human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) was isolated from a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). No significant association could be established by seroepidemiology between HHV-7 and CFS. HHV-7 is a T-lymphotropic virus, infecting CD4+ and CD8+ primary lymphocytes. HHV-7 can also infect SUP-T1, an immature T-cell line, with variable success. Southern blot analysis with DNA probes scanning 58.8% of the human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) genome and hybridizing to all HHV-6 strains tested so far revealed homology to HHV-7 with only 37.4% of the total probe length. HHV-7 contains the GGGTTA repetitive sequence, as do HHV-6 and Marek's disease chicken herpesvirus. DNA sequencing of a 186-base-pair fragment of HHV-7(JI) revealed an identity with HHV-6 and human cytomegalovirus of 57.5% and 36%, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers derived from this sequence (HV7/HV8, HV10/HV11) amplified HHV-7 DNA only and did not amplify DNA from other human herpesviruses, including 12 different HHV-6 strains. Southern blot analysis with the p43L3 probe containing the 186-base-pair HHV-7 DNA fragment hybridized to HHV-7 DNA only. The molecular divergence between human cytomegalovirus, on the one hand, and HHV-6 and HHV-7, on the other, is greater than between HHV-6 and HHV-7, which, in turn, is greater than the difference between HHV-6 strains. This study supports the classification of HHV-7 as an additional member of the human beta-herpesviruses.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: The hypothesis of an infectious etiology of the formerly named 
bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma (BAC) has raised controversy. We investigated 
tumor lung tissues from five patients with former BAC histology using 
high-throughput sequencing technologies to discover potential viruses present in 
this type of lung cancer. Around 180 million single reads of 100 bases were 
generated for each BAC sample.
RESULTS: None of the reads showed a significant similarity for Jaagsiekte sheep 
retrovirus (JSRV) and no other viruses were found except for endogenous 
retroviruses.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have demonstrated the absence of JSRV and other 
known human viruses in five samples of well-characterized lepidic 
adenocarcinoma.

Prospects of control and eradication of capripox from the Indian subcontinent: a 
perspective.

Sheeppox and goatpox, two endemic capripox infections in India, pose a 
significant economic threat to small ruminant productivity in the subcontinent. 
Vaccination of all susceptible sheep and goats is the feasible and sustainable 
means of control. Availability of effective live attenuated vaccines that are 
inherently thermostable and development of improved diagnostics provide the 
opportunities to initiate effective control measures for capripox. All animals 
older than 4 months can be vaccinated with the current homologous vaccines using 
a single vaccination by intradermal or subcutaneous routes. The success of the 
control program needs to be monitored by active surveillance particularly for 
the presence of virus, as sero-monitoring does not enable the differentiation of 
infection and vaccination. And also the sero-conversion following capripox 
vaccination is not detectable enough by the available tools. Sustained control 
efforts call for socio-economic and political stability, adequate infrastructure 
and logistic support to store and transport vaccines for reaching out vaccines 
to the remote end users. Availability of veterinary services, improved extension 
services for increased awareness among farmers, contribute significantly to the 
control campaigns. Poor vaccination coverage and in-adequate infrastructure in 
major parts of the country are some of the major elements that come in the way 
of effective implementation of building herd immunity through immunization.

Sheep are the moving banks of shepherds and their economic contribution in terms 
of meat, wool and skin/hide is immense. Various infectious diseases jeopardize 
the optimum productivity; among which sheep pox is more important as the disease 
restricts the export of sheep and their products besides other economic losses. 
Although, clinical signs are indicative of the disease but a laboratory 
confirmation is necessary for unequivocal diagnosis and studying epidemiology. 
The causative agent, sheep pox virus (SPV), is antigenically and genetically 
closely related to goat pox virus (GPV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), the 
other members of the genus capripox virus. In some countries, SPV and GPV are 
cross infective to small ruminants posing problem in diagnosis and epidemiology. 
However, recent studies have showed that the viruses are phylogenetically 
distinct and can be differentiated by molecular tools. Prophylaxis using 
attenuated vaccines is the choice of control measure as the immunity is long 
lasting. Detailed information on isolation, identification, pathology, 
epidemiology, diagnosis and prophylaxis would not only help in updating the 
knowledge of scientific fraternity but will be useful to the policy makers in 
order to formulate appropriate measures for control and eradication of the 
disease. This synthesis is to present an up-to-date review of the disease and 
its control to provide the reader with an overview of the problem.

A single tube fluorogenic RT-PCR-based 'TaqMan' assay was developed for 
detection and classification of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). TaqMan-PCR 
was optimized to quantify BVD virus using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection 
system and dual-labeled fluorogenic probes. Two different gene specific labeled 
fluorogenic probes for the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) were used to 
differentiate between BVD types I and II. Sensitivity of the single tube TaqMan 
assay was compared with two-tube TaqMan assay and standard RT-PCR using 10-fold 
dilutions of RNA. Single tube TaqMan assay was 10-100-fold more sensitive than 
the two-tube TaqMan assay and the standardized single tube RT-PCR. Specificity 
of the assay was evaluated by testing different BVD virus strains and other 
bovine viruses. A total of 106 BVD positive and negative pooled or single serum 
samples, field isolates and reference strains were tested. Quantitation of cRNA 
from types I and II BVD virus was accomplished by a standard curve plotting 
cycle threshold values (C(T)) versus copy number. Single tube TaqMan-PCR assay 
was sensitive, specific and rapid for detection, quantitation and classification 
of BVD virus.

A novel Clade 2.3.2.1c H5N1 reassortant virus caused several outbreaks in wild 
birds in some regions of China from late 2014 to 2015. Based on the genetic and 
phylogenetic analyses, the viruses possess a stable gene constellation with a 
Clade 2.3.2.1c HA, a H9N2-derived PB2 gene and the other six genes of Asian 
H5N1-origin. The Clade 2.3.2.1c H5N1 reassortants displayed a high genetic 
relationship to a human H5N1 strain (A/Alberta/01/2014). Further analysis showed 
that similar viruses have been circulating in wild birds in China, Russia, Dubai 
(Western Asia), Bulgaria and Romania (Europe), as well as domestic poultry in 
some regions of Africa. The affected areas include the Central Asian, East 
Asian-Australasian, West Asian-East African, and Black Sea/Mediterranean 
flyways. These results show that the novel Clade 2.3.2.1c reassortant viruses 
are circulating worldwide and may have gained a selective advantage in migratory 
birds, thus posing a serious threat to wild birds and potentially humans.

Genetic analysis of full-length genomes and subgenomic sequences of TT virus-like mini virus human isolates,"<jats:p>The phylogenetic relationship between the complete genomic sequences of ten Japanese and one French isolate of TT virus-like mini virus (TLMV) was investigated. Analysis of the variability of the nucleotide sequences and the detection of signature patterns for overlapping genes suggested that ORFs 1 and 2 are probably functional. However, this was not the case for a putative third ORF, ORF3. Throughout the viral genome, several nucleotide or amino acid motifs that are conserved in circoviruses such as TT virus (TTV) and chicken anaemia virus were identified. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished three main groups of TLMV and allowed the identification of putative recombination breakpoints in the untranslated region. TLMV genomes were detected by PCR in the plasma of 38/50 French blood donors tested and were also identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, faeces and saliva. A phylogenetic study of 37 TLMV strains originating from France, Japan and Brazil showed that groupings were not related to geographical origin.</jats:p>",0
Polymerase errors accumulating during natural evolution of the glycoprotein gene of vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana serotype isolates,"<jats:p>We report the entire glycoprotein (G) gene nucleotide sequences of 26 vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana serotype (VSV IND) type 1 isolates from North and Central America. These sequences are also compared with partial G gene sequences of VSV IND type 2 (Cocal) and type 3 (Alagoas) viruses and the complete G gene sequences of the more distantly related VSV New Jersey (NJ) and Chandipura viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the G gene sequences by maximum parsimony revealed four major lineages or subtypes within the classical VSV IND (type 1) viruses, each with a distinct geographic distribution. A high degree of VSV genetic diversity was found in Central America, with several virus subtypes of both VSV IND and NJ serotypes existing in this mainly enzootic disease region. Nineteen percent sequence variation but no deletions or insertions were evident within the 5' noncoding and the coding regions of the VSV IND type 1 G genes. In addition to numerous base substitutions, the 3' noncoding regions of these viruses also contained numerous base insertions and deletions. This resulted in striking variation in G gene sizes, with gene lengths ranging from 1,652 to 1,868 nucleotides. As the VSV IND type 1 subtypes have diverged from the common ancestor with the NJ subtypes, their G mRNAs have accumulated more 3' noncoding sequence inserts, ranging up to 303 nucleotides in length. These primarily consist of an imprecise reiteration of the sequence UUUUUAA, apparently generated by a unique polymerase stuttering error. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence differences among VSV IND type 1 viruses revealed numerous substitutions within defined antigenic epitopes, suggesting that immune selection may play a role in the evolution of these viruses.</jats:p>",0

Physiological properties and classification of strains of Treponema sp. isolated 
from pigs in Poland.

Binek M, Szynkiewicz ZM.

Fifty-one treponemas were isolated from pigs. Twenty-three isolates with typical 
morphology and growth characteristic were beta hemolytic, enteropathogenic, 
produced indole and with exception of three strains did not ferment fructose. 
These strains were classified as typical T. hyodysenteriae and were usually 
isolated from pigs with symptoms of mucohemorrhagic diarrhoea. The seventeen 
other isolates were weakly beta hemolytic after 48 h incubation, 
enteropathogenic, 12 out of 17 produced indole, 10 out 17 fermented fructose. 
These strains were usually isolated from pigs with symptoms of gray-green 
diarrhoea and classified as T. hyodysenteriae 2 biotype or intermediate type. 
They may be compared with Treponema sp. isolated by Taylor et al. Eleven non 
enteropathogenic strains showed typical characteristic for T. innocens. Gas 
chromatography analysis of the fatty acids production from glucose, showed that 
all isolated treponemas produced acetate and butyrate. Typical T. hyodysenteriae 
produced additionally propionate. Strains of T. hyodysenteriae biotype 2 
produced propionate or isobutyrate as well.

Chicken nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis (IB) was prevalent in the most 
chicken farms during recent years, although the IB vaccination program has been 
widely performed in China. To characterize the S1 protein of infectious 
bronchitis virus (IBV) from China, five representative nephropathogenic IB 
viruses isolated from chickens in different provinces were genetically and 
phylogenetically analyzed. The results showed that the length of the S1 genes of 
the isolates were quite different (1,617, 1,620, 1,623, 1,629, and 1,632 
nucleotides, respectively). The homology of the nucleotides and amino acids 
among the five isolates were 76.7%-92.1% and 73.9%-89.5%, respectively, 
indicating a great variation in S1 genes of the isolates. The variation in S1 
genes might affect the antigenicity and pathogenicity of the viruses. 
Genetically, point mutations, insertions, and deletions in the S1 protein can be 
observed at many positions, especially at the first 150 amino acids in the 
N-terminal of the S1 protein. Two motif cleavage sites (R-R-X-R-R/S, 
H-R-R-R-R/S) were observed in the five sequenced strains. Phylogenetic analysis 
suggested that they belonged to different lineages. These findings indicated 
that different genotypes of nephropathogenic IB viruses were co-circulating in 
the chicken population in China.

Koolpinyah virus (KOOLV) isolated from healthy Australian cattle and Yata virus 
(YATV) isolated from a pool of Mansonia uniformis mosquitoes in the Central 
African Republic have been tentatively identified as rhabdoviruses. KOOLV was 
shown previously to be related antigenically to kotonkon virus, an ephemerovirus 
that has caused an ephemeral fever-like illness in cattle in Nigeria, but YATV 
failed to react antigenically with any other virus tested. Here we report the 
complete genome sequences of KOOLV (16,133 nt) and YATV (14,479 nt). Each has a 
complex genome organisation, with multiple genes, including a second 
non-structural glycoprotein (GNS) gene and a viroporin (α1) gene, between the G 
and L genes as is characteristic of ephemeroviruses. Based on an analysis of 
genome organisation, sequence identity and cross-neutralisation, we demonstrate 
that both KOOLV and YATV should be classified as two new species in the genus 
Ephemerovirus.

Fatal Ulcerative and Hemorrhagic Typhlocolitis in a Pregnant Heifer Associated with Natural Bovine Enterovirus Type-1 Infection,"<jats:p> One 2-year-old, 7.5 months pregnant Aberdeen Angus out of a herd of 100 apparently healthy cows, died within 10 hours of hospitalization. At necropsy, multiple foci of mucosal hemorrhage and ulceration were observed in the spiral colon and cecum. Virus isolation from intestinal lesions yielded a cytopathic virus, which was revealed by electron microscopy to be an approximately 27 nm, nonenveloped virus. Further characterization by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), sequencing of the 5′UTR and partial VP1 coding region, and phylogenetic analysis classified the virus isolate as bovine enterovirus type 1 (BEV-1). No other significant pathogens were detected. This is the first report of BEV-1 isolated in the USA from an animal with fatal enteric disease in more than 20 years. Further investigation is required to determine the prevalence of BEV in North America and to establish the clinical relevance of this understudied virus. </jats:p>",0
Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Type 2-Induced Meningoencephalitis in a Heifer,"<jats:p> The brain from a 15-month-old, black female Angus, with a 48-hour history of central nervous system disease, was submitted to the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Microscopic findings consisted of acute, multifocal meningoencephalitis, with neuronal degeneration and necrosis and gliosis. Viral isolation yielded noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Virus genotyping classified the virus as BVDV type 2. Immunohistochemical labeling for BVDV antigens with BVD MAb 3.12F1 clone was prominent in the cytoplasm of neurons, glial cells, ependymal epithelium, perivascular macrophages and spindle cells, smooth muscle cells, and intravascular monocytes of the cerebrum and brain stem. Laboratory results support that tissue alterations occurred as a result of BVDV type 2 infection. In the absence of other clinical signs related to BVDV infection and using the microscopic and laboratory evidence presented, we propose that the BVDV type 2 isolated from this case may represent a neurovirulent strain of the virus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of brain lesions and neuronal viral antigen localization in BVDV genotype 2 viral infection, acquired either congenitally or postnatally. </jats:p>",0
Epitope-Blocking Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays for the Detection of Serum Antibodies to West Nile Virus in Multiple Avian Species,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>We report the development of epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the rapid detection of serum antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) in taxonomically diverse North American avian species. A panel of flavivirus-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was tested in blocking assays with serum samples from WNV-infected chickens and crows. Selected MAbs were further tested against serum samples from birds that represented 16 species and 10 families. Serum samples were collected from birds infected with WNV or Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and from noninfected control birds. Serum samples from SLEV-infected birds were included in these experiments because WNV and SLEV are closely related antigenically, are maintained in similar transmission cycles, and have overlapping geographic distributions. The ELISA that utilized MAb 3.1112G potentially discriminated between WNV and SLEV infections, as all serum samples from WNV-infected birds and none from SLEV-infected birds were positive in this assay. Assays with MAbs 2B2 and 6B6C-1 readily detected serum antibodies in all birds infected with WNV and SLEV, respectively, and in most birds infected with the other virus. Two other MAbs partially discriminated between infections with these two viruses. Serum samples from most WNV-infected birds but no SLEV-infected birds were positive with MAb 3.67G, while almost all serum samples from SLEV-infected birds but few from WNV-infected birds were positive with MAb 6B5A-5. The blocking assays reported here provide a rapid, reliable, and inexpensive diagnostic and surveillance technique to monitor WNV activity in multiple avian species.</jats:p>",0

Pestiviruses are a group of viruses of veterinary importance infecting livestock 
animals like pigs, cattle, and sheep, and also wildlife animals like wild boar 
and different deer species. While for decades only four classical species 
(Classical swine fever virus, Bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, Border 
disease virus), and a few so-called atypical pestiviruses were known (e.g., 
Giraffe virus, Pronghorn virus, HoBi virus), a series of novel pestiviruses was 
identified in the last years (Bungowannah virus, Bat pestivirus, Norway rat 
pestivirus, Atypical porcine pestivirus, LINDA virus). The Australian 
Bungowannah virus could be isolated and further characterized by classical 
sequencing, but all the other latest novel pestiviruses were identified by 
metagenomics using next-generation sequencing technologies. Here, we describe 
these new viruses and their discovery and characterization. Differentiation is 
made between the occurrence of classical pestiviruses in new species and novel 
viruses or virus types.

Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) has been found to be the causative agent of 
postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). However, PCV-2 is a 
ubiquitous virus in the swine population and a majority of pigs infected with 
PCV-2 do not develop the disease. Different factors such as age, maintenance, 
the genetics of PCV-2, other pathogens, etc. have been suggested to contribute 
to the development of PMWS. However, so far no proven connection between any of 
these factors and the disease development has been found. In this study we 
explored the possible presence of other so far unknown DNA containing infectious 
agents in lymph nodes collected from Swedish pigs with confirmed PMWS through 
random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority 
of the amplified genetic sequences belonged to PCV-2, we also found genome 
sequences of Torque Teno virus (TTV) and of a novel parvovirus. The detection of 
TTV was expected since like PCV-2, TTV has been found to have high prevalence in 
pigs around the world. We were able to amplify a longer region of the parvovirus 
genome, consisting of the entire NP1 and partial VP1/2. By comparative analysis 
of the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic studies we propose that this is a 
novel porcine parvovirus, with genetic relationship to bocaviruses.

The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies have allowed the 
possibility to investigate and characterise the entire microbiome of 
individuals, providing better insight to the complex interaction between 
different microorganisms. This will help to understand how the microbiome 
influence the susceptibility of secondary agents and development of disease. We 
have applied viral metagenomics to investigate the virome of lymph nodes from 
Swedish pigs suffering from the multifactorial disease postweaning multisystemic 
wasting syndrome (PMWS) as well as from healthy pigs. The aim is to increase 
knowledge of potential viruses, apart from porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), 
involved in PMWS development as well as to increase knowledge on the virome of 
healthy individuals. In healthy individuals, a diverse viral flora was seen with 
several different viruses present simultaneously. The majority of the identified 
viruses were small linear and circular DNA viruses, such as different 
circoviruses, anelloviruses and bocaviruses. In the pigs suffering from PMWS, 
PCV2 sequences were, as expected, detected to a high extent but other viruses 
were also identified in the background of PCV2. Apart from DNA viruses also RNA 
viruses were identified, among them were a porcine pestivirus showing high 
similarity to a recently (in 2015) discovered atypical porcine pestivirus in the 
US. Majority of the viruses identified in the background of PCV2 in PMWS pigs 
could also be identified in the healthy pigs. PCV2 sequences were also 
identified in the healthy pigs but to a much lower extent than in PMWS affected 
pigs. Although the method used here is not quantitative the very clear 
difference in amount of PCV2 sequences in PMWS affected pigs and healthy pigs 
most likely reflect the very strong replication of PCV2 known to be a hallmark 
of PMWS. Taken together, these findings illustrate that pigs appear to have a 
considerable viral flora consisting to a large extent of small single-stranded 
and circular DNA viruses. Future research on these types of viruses will help to 
better understand the role that these ubiquitous viruses may have on health and 
disease of pigs. We also demonstrate for the first time, in Europe, the presence 
of a novel porcine pestivirus.

BACKGROUND: Vermicomposting is a mesophilic process using earthworms to 
efficiently and at low cost process large volumes of organic waste. It has been 
suggested to not only increase soil fertility but also increase biomass of 
beneficial bacteria while reducing harmful bacteria. The aim of this study was 
to set up a strategy to investigate and characterise the viral as well as the 
bacterial composition of a vermicomposting system.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The vermicomposting unit used in this study was placed at 
the Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute Kabanyolo on the 
outskirts of Kampala, Uganda, and was fed with 80% cattle manure and 20% food 
waste. On Day 172, the compost was terminated and compost samples were collected 
from three layers of the unit: the top, the middle and the bottom layer. A 
metagenomic approach was then applied to characterise the viral and bacterial 
composition of the vermicomposting system.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A high abundance and diversity of bacteria were 
identified. Proteobacteria was the largest phyla in the compost (mainly Alpha-, 
Gamma- and Betaproteobacteria), constituting almost 65% of the bacterial reads 
in the data sets. DNA samples from several possible pathogenic bacteria, such as 
Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus spp. and 
Clostridium spp, were detected in the vermicompost, suggesting that there might 
still be harmful bacteria in the vermicast. Phages constituted the main viral 
group; apart from phages, mainly insect viruses were identified. The only animal 
or human virus identified was kobuvirus. In summary, metagenomic analysis was 
shown to be an efficient technology to characterise the microbial composition of 
vermicast. The data from this study contribute to a better understanding of the 
microbes present in this kind of composting system and can help determine 
measures necessary for safe manure handling.

BACKGROUND: As a result of rapidly growing human populations, intensification of 
livestock production and increasing exploitation of wildlife habitats for animal 
agriculture, the interface between wildlife, livestock and humans is expanding, 
with potential impacts on both domestic animal and human health. Wild animals 
serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel 
infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this 
background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens 
in sera collected from bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of 
wild Suid known to move between national parks and farmland, in Uganda.
RESULTS: Application of 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of Torque 
teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous 
retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis C-like virus, and a Sclerotinia 
hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the bushpigs. PCR assays for 
each specific virus combined with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV-1 
variants, one TTSuV-2 variant as well as PPV4 in the serum samples and thereby 
confirming the findings from the 454 sequencing.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a viral metagenomic approach we have made an initial analysis 
of viruses present in bushpig sera and demonstrated for the first time the 
presence of PPV4 in a wild African Suid. In addition we identified novel 
variants of TTSuV-1 and 2 in bushpigs.

Characterisation of the Virome of Tonsils from Conventional Pigs and from Specific Pathogen-Free Pigs,"<jats:p>Porcine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by a number of different microorganisms, as well as by non-infectious factors such as the management and environment of the animals. It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development.</jats:p>",0

A total of ten infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates collected from 
commercial chickens in Italy in 1999 were characterized by RT-PCR and sequencing 
of the S1 and N genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial S1 gene sequences 
showed that five field viruses clustered together with 793/B-type strains, 
having 91.3-98.5% nucleotide identity within the group, and one isolate had very 
close sequence relationship (94.6% identity) with 624/I strain. These two IBV 
types have been identified in Italy previously. The other three variant isolates 
formed novel genotype detected recently in many countries of Western Europe. For 
one of these variant viruses, Italy-02, which afterwards became the prototype 
strain, the entire S1 gene was sequenced to confirm its originality. In 
contrast, phylogenetic analysis of more conserved partial N gene sequences, 
comprising 1-300 nucleotides, revealed different clustering. Thus, three variant 
IBVs of novel Italy-02 genotype, which had 96.7-99.2% S1 gene nucleotide 
identity with each other, belonged to three separate subgroups based on N gene 
sequences. 624/I-type isolate Italy-06 together with Italy-03, which was 
undetectable using S1 gene primers, shared 97.7% and 99.3% identity, 
respectively, in N gene region with vaccine strain H120. Only one of the 
793/B-type isolates, Italy-10, clustered with the 793/B strain sharing 99.3% 
partial N gene identity, whereas the other four isolates were genetically 
distant from them (only 87.7-89.7% identity) and formed separate homogenous 
subgroup. The results demonstrated that both mutations and recombination events 
could contribute to the genetic diversity of the Italian isolates.

Prion diseases of animals and man are neurological diseases with amyloidal 
deposition of the respective proteins. As to prion disease, the cellular prion 
protein is in its abnormal isoform(s) an essential component of prion protein 
aggregates found in affected tissue. In contrast to all neurodegenerative 
diseases like Morbus Alzheimer or Huntington's disease, prion diseases are 
transmissible. Therefore, prion diseases were designated Transmissible 
Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE). The diseases have been well known for 
decades. Scrapie was first described around 1750, a BSE case was reported in the 
1850-ties most likely a misdiagnosis, and in 1920/1930 the human 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) had been described. Transmission of CJD i. e. 
Kuru had been suspected in the early 1950 s and was erroneously classified as 
slow virus disease. The CJD transmission posed a problem to humans when 
transplants from CJD cases were used for treatment. Fortunately, these 
iatrogenic transmissions remained limited. But with the advent of BSE and 
appearance of variant CJD cases in the UK and some places in Europe scientists 
suspected that transmission from cattle to man could have happened. From animal 
models we know of successful transmission via several routes. Species barriers 
do not completely prevent transmission. Rather, transmission barriers might 
exist controlling individual susceptibility against prions. Modes of 
transmission, susceptibility to transmission, identification of receptor 
molecules as well as molecular mechanisms of the transmission process are being 
investigated with great intensity. Current knowledge leads us to assume that 
inapparent stages of prion infection wrongly suggest a (non-existent) species 
barrier. This inapparent infection precedes overt disease, and, hence, most 
research focuses on the development of highly sensitive assay systems for 
detection of minute amounts of pathological prion protein in suspected cases. 
Inapparence also should warn us to underestimate BSE or human vCJD cases; at 
present, approx. 145 cases occurred in Europe and one probable case in Hong Kong 
(June 2003). Whether BSE had spread to other parts of the world by animal 
nutrition components or meat can neither be excluded nor confirmed at this time. 
New data on transmission and consequences of BSE for the human population are 
summarised in this review.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have clearly demonstrated the enormous virus 
diversity that exists among wild animals. This exemplifies the required 
expansion of our knowledge of the virus diversity present in wildlife, as well 
as the potential transmission of these viruses to domestic animals or humans.
METHODS: In the present study we evaluated the viral diversity of fecal samples 
(n = 42) collected from 10 different species of wild small carnivores inhabiting 
the northern part of Spain using random PCR in combination with next-generation 
sequencing. Samples were collected from American mink (Neovison vison), European 
mink (Mustela lutreola), European polecat (Mustela putorius), European pine 
marten (Martes martes), stone marten (Martes foina), Eurasian otter (Lutra 
lutra) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles) of the family of Mustelidae; common 
genet (Genetta genetta) of the family of Viverridae; red fox (Vulpes vulpes) of 
the family of Canidae and European wild cat (Felis silvestris) of the family of 
Felidae.
RESULTS: A number of sequences of possible novel viruses or virus variants were 
detected, including a theilovirus, phleboviruses, an amdovirus, a kobuvirus and 
picobirnaviruses.
CONCLUSIONS: Using random PCR in combination with next generation sequencing, 
sequences of various novel viruses or virus variants were detected in fecal 
samples collected from Spanish carnivores. Detected novel viruses highlight the 
viral diversity that is present in fecal material of wild carnivores.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infects domesticated and wild birds throughout the 
world, and infections with virulent NDV strains continue to cause disease 
outbreaks in poultry and wild birds. To assess the evolutionary characteristics 
of 28 NDV strains isolated from chickens in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan during 
1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005, we investigated the phylogenetic 
relationships among these viruses and viruses described previously. For 
genotyping, fusion (F) gene phylogenetic analysis (nucleotide number 47-421) was 
performed using sequences of Kazakhstanian and Kyrgyzstanian isolates as 
compared to sequences of selected NDV strains from GenBank. Phylogenetic 
analysis demonstrated that the 14 newly characterized strains from years 1998 to 
2001 belong to the NDV genotype VIIb, whereas the 14 strains isolated during 
2003-2005 were of genotype VIId. All strains possessed a virulent fusion protein 
cleavage site (R-R-Q-R/K-R-F) and had intracerebral pathogenicity indexes in 
day-old chickens that ranged from 1.05 to 1.87, both properties typical of NDV 
strains classified in the mesogenic or velogenic pathotype.

Reticuloendotheliosis virus infection, which typically causes systemic lymphomas 
and high mortality in the endangered Attwater's prairie chicken, has been 
described as a major obstacle in repopulation efforts of captive breeding 
facilities in Texas. Although antigenic relationships among 
reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) strains have been previously determined, 
phylogenetic relationships have not been reported. The pol and env of REV 
proviral DNA from prairie chickens (PC-R92 and PC-2404), from poxvirus lesions 
in domestic chickens, the prototype poultry derived REV-A and chick syncytial 
virus (CSV), and duck derived spleen necrosis virus (SNV) were PCR amplified and 
sequenced. The 5032bp, that included the pol and most of env genes, of the 
PC-R92 and REV-A were 98% identical, and nucleotide sequence identities of 
smaller regions within the pol and env from REV strains examined ranged from 95 
to 99% and 93 to 99%, respectively. The putative amino acid sequences were 
97-99% identical in the polymerase and 90-98% in the envelope. Phylogenetic 
analyses of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences indicated the closest 
relationship among the recent fowl pox-associated chicken isolates, the prairie 
chicken isolates and the prototype CSV while only the SNV appeared to be 
distinctly divergent. While the origin of the naturally occurring viruses is not 
known, the avian poxvirus may be a critical component of transmission of these 
ubiquitous oncogenic viruses.

Genetic characterization of bovine viral diarrhea viruses isolated from persistently infected calves born to dams vaccinated against bovine viral diarrhea virus before breeding,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Objective</jats:bold>—To collect and partially characterize strains of bovine viral diarrhea viruses(BVDVs) isolated from persistently infected (PI) calves born to vaccinated dams, determine genetic diversity of the isolated viruses, and identify regional distribution of genetically similar virus subpopulations.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Sample Population</jats:bold>—17 noncytopathic (NCP) BVDVs from PI calves from 11 herds of beef or dairy cattle.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Procedures</jats:bold>—Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures, and BVDV-specific PCR primers were used to amplify &gt; 1,000 bases of the viral genome. Derived sequences were used for molecular phylogenetic analyses to determine the viral genotype and viral genogroup and to assess genetic similarity among BVDVs.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>—Analysis of the 17 NCP strains of BVDV failed to detect a viral genotype or viral genogroup not already reported to exist in the United States. One virus was classified as genotype 1, genogroup 1b, and 16 viruses were classified as genotype 2, genogroup 2a. Genotype 2 strains were genetically diverse, and genetic similarities were not obvious among viruses from geographic regions larger than a small locale.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions and Clinical Relevance</jats:bold>—Viruses isolated from herds where a genotype 1, genogroup 1a BVDV vaccine was administered prior to breeding were primarily genetically diverse genotype 2, genogroup 2a BVDVs. Vaccination with multiple BVDV genotypes may be needed to improve protection. Methods used in this study to obtain and analyze field strains are applicable to assessing efficacy of current BVDV vaccines. Candidates for future vaccines are viruses that appear able to elude the immune response of cattle vaccinated against BVDV with existing vaccines.</jats:p>",0
Prevalence of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Genotypes and Antibody against those Viral Genotypes in Fetal Bovine Serum,<jats:p> One thousand lots of pooled fetal bovine serum (FBS) were tested for contamination with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and/or for contamination with neutralizing antibody against BVDV. Noncytopathic or cytopathic BVDV was isolated from 203 lots of FBS. Analysis of the viral isolates identified 115 type 1 and 65 type 2 BVDV isolates. An additional 23 virus isolates were mixtures of &gt;2 BVDV isolates and were not classified to viral genotype.

Differential viral neutralization indicated that type 1 BVDV induced the antibody detected in 48 lots of FBS and type 2 BVDV induced the antibody detected in 16 lots of FBS. </jats:p>,0
Unexpected Diversity and Expression of Avian Endogenous Retroviruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) were identified and characterized in three avian genomes to gain insight into early retroviral evolution. Using the computer program RetroTector to detect relatively intact ERVs, we identified 500 ERVs in the chicken genome, 150 in the turkey genome, and 1,200 in the zebra finch genome. Previous studies suggested that endogenous alpharetroviruses were present in chicken genomes. In this analysis, a small number of alpharetroviruses were seen in the chicken and turkey genomes; however, these were greatly outnumbered by beta-like, gamma-like, and alphabeta proviruses. While the avian ERVs belonged to the same major groups as mammalian ERVs, they were more heterogeneous. In particular, the beta-like viruses revealed an evolutionary continuum with the gradual acquisition and loss of betaretroviral markers and a transition from beta to alphabeta and then to alpharetroviruses. Thus, it appears that birds may resemble a melting pot for early ERV evolution. Many of the ERVs were integrated in clusters on chromosomes, often near centromeres. About 25% of the chicken ERVs were in or near cellular transcription units; this is nearly random. The majority of these integrations were in the sense orientation in introns. A higher-than-random number of integrations were &gt;100 kb from the nearest gene. Deep-sequencing studies of chicken embryo fibroblasts revealed that about 20% of the 500 ERVs were transcribed and translated. A subset of these were also transcribed

            in chickens, showing tissue-specific patterns of expression.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Studies of avian endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have given us a glimpse of an earlier retroviral world. Three different classes of ERVs were observed with many features of mammalian retroviruses, as well as some important differences. Many avian ERVs were transcribed and translated.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) infection of ruminants is endemic throughout much of the 
US and China. The S10 and a portion of the L2 gene segments of Chinese prototype 
strains of BTV serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 15, and 16 were sequenced and compared 
to the same genes of prototype and field strains of BTV from the US. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the S10 gene segregated the Chinese viruses into a 
monophyletic group distinct from the US viruses, whereas similar analysis of the 
L2 gene segregated strains of BTV according to serotype, regardless of 
geographic origin.

Two outbreaks of orf virus (ORFV) (a parapoxvirus) infection in goats, which 
occurred in Golaghat and Kamrup districts of Assam, a northeastern part of 
India, were investigated. The disease was diagnosed by standard virological and 
molecular techniques. The entire protein-coding region of B2L gene of two 
isolates were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on B2L amino 
acid sequences showed that the ORFVs identified in these outbreaks were closely 
related to each other and both were closer to ORFV-Shahjahanpur 82/04 isolate 
from north India. The present study revealed that the precise characterization 
of the genomic region (B2L gene) might provide evidence for the genetic 
variation and movement of circulating ORFV strains in India.

Outbreaks of contagious ecthyma (caused by a Parapox virus) in goats were 
investigated in 6 districts of Assam, a north eastern state of India. Diagnosis 
of the disease was carried out employing both standard virological as well as 
molecular methods. Four representative isolates from different places were 
selected for phylogenetic analysis. The major envelop protein (B2L) of Orf virus 
was targeted for molecular analysis. The sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 
the selected sequences at nucleotide level revealed that the Orf virus isolates 
were closely related to each other (97.6-100 %) and showed highest similarity to 
the Orf virus isolate 82/04 (98.4 %), reported from Shahjahanpur, India. The 
data will provide an insight in transmission of the virus from northern to North 
eastern part of the country.

Identification and complete genome characterization of a novel picornavirus in turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),"<jats:p>Members of the family <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic> are important pathogens of humans and animals, although compared with the thousands of known bird species (&gt;10 000), only a few (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 11) picornaviruses have been identified from avian sources. This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples collected from eight turkey farms in Hungary. Using RT-PCR, both healthy (two of three) and affected (seven of eight) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome were shown to be shedding viruses in seven (88 %) of the eight farms. The viral genome sequence (turkey/M176/2011/HUN; GenBank accession no. JQ691613) shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (96 %) to the partial P3 genome region of a picornavirus reported recently in turkey and chickens from the USA and probably belongs to the same species. In the P1 and P2 regions, turkey/M176/2011/HUN is related most closely to, but distinct from, the kobuviruses and turdivirus 1. Complete genome analysis revealed the presence of characteristic picornaviral amino acid motifs, a potential type II-like 5′ UTR internal ribosome entry site (first identified among avian-origin picornaviruses) and a conserved, 48 nt long ‘barbell-like’ structure found at the 3′ UTR of turkey/M176/2011/HUN and members of the picornavirus genera <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Kobuvirus</jats:italic>. The general presence of turkey picornavirus – a novel picornavirus species – in faecal samples from healthy and affected turkeys in Hungary and in the USA suggests the worldwide occurrence and endemic circulation of this virus in turkey farms. Further studies are needed to investigate the aetiological role and pathogenic potential of this picornavirus in food animals.</jats:p>",0
Genetic characterization of a novel picornavirus in turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) distinct from turkey galliviruses and megriviruses and distantly related to the members of the genus Avihepatovirus,"<jats:p>This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples of healthy (1/3) and affected (6/8) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome in Hungary. The virus was detected at seven of the eight farms examined. The turkey/M176-TuASV/2011/HUN genome (KC465954) was genetically different from the currently known picornaviruses of turkey origin (megriviruses and galliviruses), and showed distant phylogenetic relationship and common genomic features (e.g. uncleaved VP0 and three predicted and unrelated 2A polypeptides) to duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) of the genus <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic>. The complete genome analysis revealed multiple distinct genome features like the presence of two in-tandem aphthovirus 2A-like sequence repeats with DxExNPG/P ‘ribosome-skipping’ sites (76 %, 23/30 amino acids identical), with the first aphthovirus 2A-like sequence being located at the end of the VP1 capsid protein (VP1/2A1 ‘ribosome-skipping’ site). The phylogenetic analyses, low sequence identity (33, 32 and 36 % amino acid identity in P1, P2 and P3 regions) to DHAV, and the type II-like internal ribosome entry site suggests that this turkey picornavirus is related to, but distinct from the genus <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> and it could be the founding member of a novel <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> sister-clade genus.

In this study all currently known chicken picornaviruses including a novel one 
(chicken phacovirus 1, KT880670) were identified by viral metagenomic and RT-PCR 
methods from a single specimen of a diarrheic chicken suffering from a total of 
eight picornavirus co-infections, in Hungary. The complete genomes of six 
picornaviruses were determined and their genomic and phylogenetic 
characteristics and UTR RNA structural models analyzed in details. 
Picornaviruses belonged to genera Sicinivirus (the first complete genome), 
Gallivirus, Tremovirus, Avisivirus and ""Orivirus"" (two potential genotypes). In 
addition, the unassigned phacoviruses were also detected in multiple samples of 
chickens in the USA. Multiple co-infections promote and facilitate the 
recombination and evolution of picornaviruses and eventually could contribute to 
the severity of the diarrhea in chicken, in one of the most important food 
sources of humans.

The members of the genus Avihepatovirus and related picornaviruses (""Aalivius"") 
of ducks, turkey and chickens possess identical 2A peptide composition including 
three functionally unrelated 2A peptides which is a characteristic genome 
feature of these monophyletic avian picornaviruses. The complete genome of a 
novel picornavirus provisionally named Orivirus A1 (KM203656) from a cloacal 
sample of a 4-week-old diarrheic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) distantly 
related to members of genus Avihepatovirus was characterized. The study strain 
contains a type-II-like IRES, a single 2A protein of unknown function unrelated 
to the 2A proteins of avihepatoviruses and a long 3' untranslated region (UTR) 
with multiple repeated sequence motifs followed by an AUG-rich region. The 
repeated sequences of the 3' UTR show significant identity to the ""Unit A"" 
sequences of the phylogenetically distant megriviruses. The presence of a novel 
single 2A and the megrivirus-like ""Unit A"" motifs suggest multiple recombination 
events in the evolution of this novel picornavirus.

The complete genome of goose picornavirus 1 (GPV-1) strain goose/NLSZK2/HUN/2013 
(MF358731) was determined by RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing from a 
cloacal sample of a migratory waterfowl, greater white-fronted goose (Anser

with a 5'-terminal origin of replication (ORI) region, a type-IV IRES, and an 
Hbox/NC-type 2A protein. This virus showed the highest overall sequence identity 
to the members of the genus Kobuvirus, although the phylogenetic position of 
GPV-1 is different in the analyzed P1, 2C and 3CD phylogenetic trees, which 
further increases the diversity of known avian picornaviruses.

Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) of family Picobirnaviridae have bisegmented (S1 and S2 
segments), double-stranded RNA genomes. In this study a total of N = 12 complete 
chicken PBVs (ChPBV) segments (N = 5 of S1 and N = 7 of S2, Acc. Nos.: 
MH425579-90) were determined using viral metagenomic and RT-PCR techniques from 
a single cloacal sample of a diarrheic chicken. The identified ChPBV segments 
are unrelated to each other and distant from all of the currently known PBVs. In 
silico sequence analyses revealed the presence of conserved prokaryotic 
Shine-Dalgarno-like (SD-like) sequences upstream of the three presumed open 
reading frames (ORFs) of the S1 and a single presumed ORF of the S2 segments. 
According to the results of expression analyses in E. coli using 6xHis-tagged 
recombinant ChPBV segment 1 construct and Western blot these SD-like sequences 
are functional in vivo suggesting that S1 of study PBVs can contain three ORFs 
and supporting the bacteriophage-nature of PBVs.

Characterization of neutralization sites on the circulating variant of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV): a new site is shared by SVDV and the related coxsackie B5 virus,"<jats:p>Using a panel of new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), five neutralizing, conformation-dependent sites have been identified on the antigenic variant of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) circulating currently. In studies on the antigenic conservation of these sites, the four antigenic/genetic groups of SVDV described showed distinguishable patterns, confirming this classification. By sequencing mAb-resistant mutants, the five sites have been mapped precisely and localized on a three-dimensional model of the SVDV capsid. All were found to be orientated, to a different extent, towards the external surface of the capsid. Three of the five sites, located in VP1, VP2 and VP3, correspond to epitopes identified previously in historic isolates as sites 1, 2a and 3b, respectively. Another site, site IV, which maps to position 258 of VP1, corresponds to an epitope reported recently and is described in this study to be specific for isolates of the most recent antigenic group of SVDV. A fifth site is described for the first time and corresponds to the unique neutralizing site that is common to both SVDV and coxsackie B5 virus; it maps to positions 95 and 98 of VP1, but may also include positions nearby that belong to site 1 on the BC-loop of VP1, suggesting the classification of site Ia. These results may have useful diagnostic and epidemiological applications, since mAbs to the new conserved site Ia provide universal reagents for SVDV detection systems, while the specificity of mAbs to site IV make them unique markers for the most recent strains of SVDV.</jats:p>",0

Five different viral diseases of livestock, lumpy skin disease (LSD), sheep pox 
(SPP), goat pox (GTP), Rift Valley fever (RVF) and peste des petits ruminants 
(PPR), circulate in the same regions of Africa, imposing a major burden on 
economic activity and public health. While commercial vaccines against these 
viruses are available, the cost of implementing regular vaccination regimens 
against multiple diseases is prohibitive for most African farmers. A single, 
affordable multivalent vaccine that simultaneously protects against all 5 
diseases would therefore be of significant benefit to the livestock sector in 
Africa. It could also serve as a platform for the development of new vaccines of 
significance to other developing countries around the world. In this paper, we 
present an overview of the economic importance of livestock in Africa, the 
pathogens responsible for RVF, PPR, SPP, GTP and LSD and the vaccination 
strategies currently used to combat them. We then review experience with the 
development of attenuated capripoxviruses as vaccines against LSD, SPP and GTP 
and of recombinant capripoxvirus-vectored vaccines against RVF and PPR. We 
conclude the article by presenting the rationale for a single, multivalent 
capripoxvirus-vectored vaccine that would protect against all 5 diseases of

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is present in different species and ecological niches. 
It has been divided into 4 major mammalian genotypes. In this study, 3 new 
full-length genomes of swine HEV were sequenced and the results did not reveal 
any particular host determinant in comparison with human isolates belonging to 
the same genotype. Nucleotide composition and codon usage bias were determined 
to characterize HEV host restriction and genome evolution. Peculiar nucleotide 
bias was observed for A and C nucleotides in all HEV genotypes. Apart from the 
ORF1 hypervariable region and the ORF2/3 overlapping region, no nucleotide bias 
was observed between the 3 codon positions. CpG dinucleotides were also shown to 
be under-represented in HEV as in most RNA viruses. The effective number of 
codon used in HEV genome was high, indicating a lack of codon bias. 
Correspondence analysis of the relative synonymous codon usage was performed and 
demonstrated that evolution of HEV is not driven by geographical or host 
factors, but is representative of HEV phylogeny. These results confirm that HEV 
genome evolution is mainly based on mutational pressure. Natural selection, for 
instance involving fine-tuning translation kinetics and escape from the host 
immune system, may also play a role in shaping the HEV genome, particularly in 
the ORF1 hypervariable region and the ORF2/3 overlapping region. These regions 
might be involved in host restriction. Finally this study revealed the need to 
re-evaluate the possible subtyping classification.

Identical Consensus Sequence and Conserved Genomic Polymorphism of Hepatitis E Virus during Controlled Interspecies Transmission,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>High-throughput sequencing of bile and feces from two pigs experimentally infected with human hepatitis E virus (HEV) of genotype 3f revealed the same full-length consensus sequence as in the human sample. Twenty-nine percent of polymorphic sites found in HEV from the human sample were conserved throughout the infection of the heterologous host. The interspecies transmission of HEV quasispecies is the result of a genomic negative-selection pressure on random mutations which can be deleterious to the viral population. HEV intrahost nucleotide diversity was found to be in the lower range of other human RNA viruses but correlated with values found for zoonotic viruses. HEV transmission between humans and pigs does not seem to be modulated by host-specific mutations, suggesting that adaptation is mainly regulated by ecological drivers.</jats:p>",0
Neurotropic Astrovirus in Cattle with Nonsuppurative Encephalitis in Europe,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Encephalitis is a frequently diagnosed condition in cattle with neurological diseases. Many affected animals present with a nonsuppurative inflammatory reaction pattern in the brain. While this pattern supports a viral etiology, the causative pathogen remains unknown in a large proportion of cases. Using viral metagenomics, we identified an astrovirus (bovine astrovirus [BoAstV]-CH13) in the brain of a cow with nonsuppurative encephalitis. Additionally, BoAstV RNA was detected with reverse transcription-PCR and
            <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
            hybridization in about one fourth (5/22 animals) of cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis of unknown etiology. Viral RNA was found primarily in neurons and at the site of pathology. These findings support the notion that BoAstV infection is a common cause of encephalitis in cattle. Phylogenetically, BoAstV-CH13 was closely related to rare astrovirus isolates from encephalitis cases in animals and a human patient. Future research needs to be directed toward the pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiology, and potential cross-species transmission of these neurotropic astroviruses.

Shot-gun next generation sequencing (NGS) on whole DNA extracted from specimens 
collected from mammals often produces reads that are not mapped (i.e. unmapped 
reads) on the host reference genome and that are usually discarded as 
by-products of the experiments. In this study, we mined Ion Torrent reads 
obtained by sequencing DNA isolated from archived blood samples collected from 
100 performance tested Italian Large White pigs. Two reduced representation 
libraries were prepared from two DNA pools constructed each from 50 equimolar 
DNA samples. Bioinformatic analyses were carried out to mine unmapped reads on 
the reference pig genome that were obtained from the two NGS datasets. In silico 
analyses included read mapping and sequence assembly approaches for a viral 
metagenomic analysis using the NCBI Viral Genome Resource. Our approach 
identified sequences matching several viruses of the Parvoviridae family: 
porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2), PPV4, PPV5 and PPV6 and porcine bocavirus 1-H18 
isolate (PBoV1-H18). The presence of these viruses was confirmed by PCR and 
Sanger sequencing of individual DNA samples. PPV2, PPV4, PPV5, PPV6 and 
PBoV1-H18 were all identified in samples collected in 1998-2007, 1998-2000, 
1997-2000, 1998-2004 and 2003, respectively. For most of these viruses (PPV4, 
PPV5, PPV6 and PBoV1-H18) previous studies reported their first occurrence much 
later (from 5 to more than 10 years) than our identification period and in 
different geographic areas. Our study provided a retrospective evaluation of 
apparently asymptomatic parvovirus infected pigs providing information that 
could be important to define occurrence and prevalence of different parvoviruses 
in South Europe. This study demonstrated the potential of mining NGS datasets 
non-originally derived by metagenomics experiments for viral metagenomics 
analyses in a livestock species.

Menangle virus (MenV), isolated in August 1997 following an outbreak of 
reproductive disease in a piggery in New South Wales, is the second previously 
unclassified member of the family Paramyxoviridae to be identified in Australia 
since 1994. Similar to Hendra virus (HeV), MenV appears to be a virus of fruit 
bats (flying foxes) in the genus Pteropus. No serological cross-reactivity was 
detected between MenV and other known paramyxoviruses and to facilitate virus 
classification a cDNA subtraction method was used to obtain viral-specific cDNA 
from MenV-infected cells. Cloning and sequencing of the products enabled the 
entire sequences of the NP, P/V, M, F, and HN genes to be determined. Comparison 
of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for each gene with members of 
the family Paramyxoviridae, determination of the P gene mRNA editing strategy, 
and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that MenV is a new member of the genus 
Rubulavirus. However the deduced protein sequence of MenV HN exhibited only 
limited sequence homology when compared with attachment proteins of other 
paramyxoviruses. Key differences within the amino acid residues considered 
important determinants of neuraminidase activity suggest MenV HN is unlikely to 
possess the same degree of neuraminidase activity characteristic of other 
rubulavirus and respirovirus HN proteins.

Analysis of the Differential Host Cell Nuclear Proteome Induced by Attenuated and Virulent Hemorrhagic Arenavirus Infection,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Arenaviruses are important emerging pathogens and include a number of hemorrhagic fever viruses classified as NIAID category A priority pathogens and CDC potential biothreat agents. Infection of guinea pigs with the New World arenavirus<jats:italic>Pichindé virus</jats:italic>(PICV) has been used as a biosafety level 2 model for the<jats:italic>Lassa virus</jats:italic>. Despite continuing research, little is known about the molecular basis of pathogenesis, and this has hindered the design of novel antiviral therapeutics. Modulation of the host response is a potential strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases. We have previously investigated the global host response to attenuated and lethal arenavirus infections by using high-throughput immunoblotting and kinomics approaches. In this report, we describe the differential nuclear proteomes of a murine cell line induced by mock infection and infection with attenuated and lethal variants of PICV, investigated by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Spot identification using tandem mass spectrometry revealed the involvement of a number of proteins that regulate inflammation via potential modulation of NF-κB activity and of several heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear proteins. Pathway analysis revealed a potential role for transcription factor XBP-1, a transcription factor involved in major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) expression; differential DNA-binding activity was revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and differences in surface MHC-II expression were seen following PICV infection. These data are consistent with the results of several previous studies and highlight potential differences between transcriptional and translational regulation. This study provides a number of differentially expressed targets for further research and suggests that key events in pathogenesis may be established early in infection.</jats:p>",0
Genomic Sequences of Australian Bluetongue Virus Prototype Serotypes Reveal Global Relationships and Possible Routes of Entry into Australia,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bluetongue virus (BTV) is transmitted by biting midges (
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Culicoides</jats:named-content>
            spp.). It causes disease mainly in sheep and occasionally in cattle and other species. BTV has spread into northern Europe, causing disease in sheep and cattle. The introduction of new serotypes, changes in vector species, and climate change have contributed to these changes. Ten BTV serotypes have been isolated in Australia without apparent associated disease. Simplified methods for preferential isolation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and template preparation enabled high-throughput sequencing of the 10 genome segments of all Australian BTV prototype serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis reinforced the Western and Eastern topotypes previously characterized but revealed unique features of several Australian BTVs. Many of the Australian BTV genome segments (Seg-) were closely related, clustering together within the Eastern topotypes. A novel Australian topotype for Seg-5 (NS1) was identified, with taxa spread across several serotypes and over time. Seg-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -9, and -10 of BTV_2_AUS_2008 were most closely related to the cognate segments of viruses from Taiwan and Asia and not other Australian viruses, supporting the conclusion that BTV_2 entered Australia recently. The Australian BTV_15_AUS_1982 prototype was revealed to be unusual among the Australian BTV isolates, with Seg-3 and -8 distantly related to other BTV sequences from all serotypes.

Few complete genome sequences of influenza A viruses from Europe are publicly available at the present time and there have been few longitudinal genome studies of human influenza A viruses.

H1N2 viruses were first observed in Denmark in 2002–2003. After years of little genetic change in the H1N1 viruses the 2005–2006 season presented H1N1 of greater variability than before. This indicates that H1N1 viruses are evolving and that H1N1 soon is likely to be the prevalent strain again. Generally, the influenza A haemagglutinin (HA) of H3N2 viruses formed seasonal phylogenetic clusters. Different lineages co-circulating within the same season were also observed. The evolution has been stochastic, influenced by small ""jumps"" in genetic distance rather than constant drift, especially with the introduction of the Fujian-like viruses in 2002–2003. Also evolutionary stasis-periods were observed which might indicate well fit viruses. The evolution of H3N2 viruses have also been influenced by gene reassortments between lineages from different seasons. None of the influenza genes were influenced by strong positive selection pressure. The antigenic site B in H3N2 HA was the preferred site for genetic change during the study period probably because the site A has been masked by glycosylations. Substitutions at CTL-epitopes in the genes coding for the neuraminidase (NA), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein 1 (M1), non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and especially the nucleoprotein (NP) were observed.

Within the family Flaviviridae, viruses within the genus Pestivirus, such as 
Border disease virus (BDV) of sheep, can cause great economic losses in farm 
animals. Originally, the taxonomic classification of pestiviruses was based on 
the host species they were isolated from, but today, it is known that many 
pestiviruses exhibit a broad species tropism. This review provides an overview 
of BDV infection in cattle. The clinical, hematological and 
pathological-anatomical findings in bovines that were transiently or 
persistently infected with BDV largely resemble those in cattle infected with 
the closely related pestivirus bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). Accordingly, 
the diagnosis of BDV infection can be challenging, as it must be differentiated 
from various pestiviruses in cattle. The latter is very relevant in countries 
with control programs to eradicate BVDV in Bovidae, as in most circumstances, 
pestivirus infections in sheep, which act as reservoir for BDV, are not included 
in the eradication scheme. Interspecies transmission of BDV between sheep and 
cattle occurs regularly, but BDV in cattle appears to be of minor general 
importance. Nevertheless, BDV outbreaks at farm or local level can be very 
costly.

A detailed molecular analysis of blood or other biological stains at a crime 
scene is often hampered by the low quantity and quality of the extractable DNA. 
However, the determination of the origin and composition of a stain is in most 
cases a prerequisite for the final elucidation of a criminal case. Standard 
methodologies, e.g. amplification of DNA followed by microsatellite typing or 
mitochondrial DNA sequencing, are often not sensitive enough to result in 
sufficient and conclusive data. We have applied ultra-deep DNA sequencing using 
the 454 pyrosequencing technology on a whole genome amplified (WGA) 
environmental biological stain, which was analysed unsuccessfully with standard 
methodologies following WGA. With the combination of WGA and 454 pyrosequencing, 
however, we were able to generate 7242 single sequences with an average length 
of 195bp. A total of 1,441,971bp DNA sequences were generated and compared with 
public DNA sequence databases. Using RepeatMasker and basic logical alignment 
search tool (BLAST) searches against known microbial and mammalian genomes it 
was possible to determine the metagenomic composition of the stain, i.e. 4.2% 
bacterial DNA, 0.3% viral DNA, 2.7% fungal DNA, 10.3% mammalian repetitive DNA, 
0.9% porcine DNA, 0.13% human DNA and 81.5% DNA of unknown origin. Our data 
demonstrate that 454 pyrosequencing has the potential to become a powerful tool 
not only in basic research but also in the metagenomic analysis of biological 
trace materials for forensic genetics.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the cause of chickenpox and zoster, was the first 
human herpesvirus to be sequenced fully and the first for which vaccines have 
been licensed and widely used. Three groups have published genotyping schemes 
based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and, between them, have 
identified five distinct phylogenetic clades, with an additional two putative 
clades. Sequencing of over 23 whole VZV genomes from around the world further 
refined the phylogenetic distinctions between SNP genotypes. Widespread 
surveillance in countries in which the varicella vaccine is now in use and the 
difficulties posed by three unique genotyping approaches prompted an 
international meeting, at which a common nomenclature based on phylogenetic 
clades was agreed upon. In this paper, we review the original genotyping schemes 
and discuss the basis for a novel common nomenclature for VZV strains. We 
propose a minimum set of SNPs that we recommend should be used to genotype these 
viruses. Finally, we suggest criteria by which novel clades can be recognized.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus affects livestock worldwide. There are seven 
different serotypes, each with a diversity of topotypes, genetic lineages and 
strains. Some lineages have different properties that may contribute to sporadic 
spread beyond their recognized endemic areas. The objective of this study was to 
review the most significant FMD epidemiological events that took place worldwide 
between 2007 and 2014. Severe epidemics were caused by FMD virus (FMDV) lineage 
O/Asia/Mya-98 in Japan and South Korea in 2010, both previously free of disease. 
In India, where FMD is endemic, the most important event was the re-emergence of 
lineage O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 in 2008. Notably, this lineage, normally restricted to 
India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, was also found in Saudi Arabia and Libya in 
2013 and has caused several outbreaks in Tunisia and Algeria in 2014-2015. In 
January 2011, FMDV-positive wild boars were found in Bulgaria, where the disease 
last occurred in 1996, followed by 12 outbreaks in livestock infected with FMDV 
O/ME-SA/PanAsia2. In 2012, FMDV SAT2 caused outbreaks in Egypt and the 
Palestinian Autonomous Territories. Another significant event was the emergence 
of FMDV Asia1 Sindh-08 in the Middle East. In South America, one outbreak of 
FMDV serotype O, topotype Euro-SA was reported in Paraguay in 2011, which was 
recognized as FMD-free with vaccination at the time. Lessons learned from past 
events, point out the need for an integrated strategy that comprises coordinated 
global and regional efforts for FMDV control and surveillance. Specific local 
characteristics related to host, environment and virus that condition FMD 
occurrence should be carefully considered and incorporated to adapt appropriate 
strategies into local plans. In this review, we compiled relevant 
epidemiological FMD events to provide a global overview of the current 
situation. We further discussed current challenges present in different FMD 
areas.

Transmission of ovine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV), a lentivirus of sheep, 
occurs through both maternal and non-maternal means. Currently, the contribution 
of each route to the overall flock OPPV prevalence is poorly understood since 
previous serological epidemiologic studies lacked the ability to accurately 
track routes of transmission within an infected flock. In this study, the amount 
of maternal OPP transmission was assessed in a naturally infected ewe flock by 
applying molecular analyses to proviral sequences derived from peripheral blood 
leukocytes of OPP positive dam-daughter pairs (N=40). Both proviral envelope 
(env) and long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences, separately and combined, were 
utilized in the following 2 sequence analysis methods: phylogenetic analysis and 
pairwise distance calculations. True maternal transmission events were defined 
as agreement in 2 out of the 2 sequence analysis methods. Using this criterion, 
proviral env sequences resulted in a 14.3% maternal transmission frequency, and 
proviral LTR sequences resulted in a 10% maternal transmission frequency. Both 
proportions of maternal transmission varied significantly from equality 
(P<0.0001). This indicates that the remaining 85.7-90% of daughters are infected 
via non-maternal transmission. This is also the first study to calculate the OPP 
proviral rate of change for the env gene and LTR promoter. Accurately defining 
the routes of OPPV transmission provides critical epidemiological data 
supporting management intended to reduce flock transmission and viral dose.

Four avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) subgroups (A-D) have been reported previously 
based on genetic and antigenic differences. However, until now full length 
sequences of the only known isolates of European subgroup C and subgroup D 
viruses (duck and turkey origin, respectively) have been unavailable. These full 
length sequences were determined and compared with other full length AMPV and 
human metapneumoviruses (HMPV) sequences reported previously, using 
phylogenetics, comparisons of nucleic and amino acid sequences and study of 
codon usage bias. Results confirmed that subgroup C viruses were more closely 
related to HMPV than they were to the other AMPV subgroups in the study. This 
was consistent with previous findings using partial genome sequences. Closer 
relationships between AMPV-A, B and D were also evident throughout the majority 
of results. Three metapneumovirus ""clusters"" HMPV, AMPV-C and AMPV-A, B and D 
were further supported by codon bias and phylogenetics. The data presented here 
together with those of previous studies describing antigenic relationships also 
between AMPV-A, B and D and between AMPV-C and HMPV may call for a 
subclassification of metapneumoviruses similar to that used for avian 
paramyxoviruses, grouping AMPV-A, B and D as type I metapneumoviruses and AMPV-C 
and HMPV as type II.

Bovine virus diarrhoea virus ‐ strategic decisions for diagnosis and control,"<jats:p>IN the 15 years since the last <jats:italic>In Practice</jats:italic> article on bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) (Brownlie 1985), there has been an explosion in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral replication and mutation, especially those related to biotypic variation. Hand in hand has come a greater understanding of the importance of BVDV as a primary pathogen of cattle, particularly as a cause of reproductive loss. A BVDV vaccine is now available in the UK, giving better prospects for protection against infection. However, for the veterinary clinician, the strategic decisions regarding diagnosis, control and vaccination continue to pose difficult dilemmas and it is on these issues that this article focuses.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) is a close 
relative of the human Enterovirus B serotype, coxsackievirus B5. As the 
etiological agent of a significant emergent veterinary disease, several studies 
have attempted to explain its origin. However, several key questions remain, 
including the full biological ancestry of the virus, and its geographical and 
temporal origin.
METHODOLOGY: We sequenced near-complete genomes of 27 SVDV and 13 coxsackievirus 
B5 samples, all originally isolated between 1966 and 2006, and analysed these in 
conjunction with existing sequences and historical information.
RESULTS: While analyses incorporating 24 additional near-complete SVDV genomic 
sequences indicate clear signs of within-SVDV recombination, all 51 SVDV 
isolates remain monophyletic. This supports a hypothesis of a single 
anthroponotic transfer origin. Analysis of individual coding and non-coding 
regions supports that SVDV has a recombinant origin between coxsackievirus B5 
and another Enterovirus B serotype, most likely coxsackievirus A9. Extensive 
Bayesian sequence-based analysis of the time of the most recent common ancestor 
of all analysed sequences places this within a few years around 1961. 
Epidemiological evidence points to China as an origin, but there are no 
available samples to test this conclusively.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Historical investigation and the clinical aspects 
of the involved Enterovirus B serotypes, makes the current results consistent 
with a hypothesis stating that SVDV originated through co-infection, 
recombination, and a single anthroponotic event, during large viral meningitis 
epidemics around 1960/1961 involving the ancestral serotypes. The exact 
geographical origin of SVDV may remain untestable due to historical aspects.

Piry virus mutants selected for altered growth properties in Drosophila 
melanogaster have previously been designated agD mutants. This paper presents a 
classification scheme for grouping some of these mutants and also presents the 
characteristics of some members of each group. Analysis, for each agD clone, of 
the mean incubation time at 20 degrees C relative to the mean incubation time at 
28 degrees C (t20,t28), compared to the range of similar data for wild-type 
virus enabled us to define 4 classes of agD mutant: (1) mutants equally affected 
at both temperatures, (2) cold-sensitive mutants in drosophila (csD), (3) 
heat-sensitive mutants in drosophila (tsD) and (4) mutants whose mean incubation 
time could not be estimated at either 20 or 28 degrees C. All agD mutants are 
listed. The majority of them were also ts in chicken embryo cells (CEC), and 
some were classified into complementation groups. Some correlations were noted. 
For example, the agD mutants that were ts+ in CEC were frequently (7 out of 12) 
weakly cold-sensitive in drosophila. Those tsD mutants which were also ts in 
CEC, all belonged to complementation group I (L protein). True csD mutants, 
whose divergence of incubation time with wt regularly increased, and which were 
also ts in CEC, all belonged to group I except for one which belonged to group V 
(G protein). Three mutants fell into a distinct sub-class of csD mutants, 
characterized by a defect in the CO2 sensitivity symptom expression below a 
definite temperature. One of these which was further characterized was shown to 
be in complementation group V. Some mutants of the fourth class were examined 
for their fly-invading capacity. This was found to be more-or-less strongly 
affected. Among these mutants, independent of this phenomenon, mutations were 
assigned to L, N and G proteins, suggesting that different physiological defects 
are involved. A comparison was made of the phenotypes in drosophila of some of 
the agD mutants with other members of the vesiculovirus family. The analogy of 
sigma rhabdovirus with tsD mutants is also reported.

BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is classified as viral hemorrhagic fever and 
is endemic in East and West Africa. RVF is caused by an arthropod borne virus 
(RVFV); the disease is zoonotic and affects human, animal health as well as 
international trade. In livestock it causes abortions, while human infection 
occurs through close contact with infected animals or animal products.
METHODS: A quantitative observational study using stratified sampling was 
conducted in the western region of Uganda. Blood samples and abortion events 
from 1000 livestock (goats, sheep and cattle) was collected and recorded. Serum 
was analyzed for RVFV IgG reacting antibodies using competitive ELISA test.
RESULTS: The overall RVFV seroprevalence was of 10.4% (104/1000). Cattle had the 
highest seroprevalence (7%) followed by Sheep (2.2%) then goats (1.2%). Species 
specific RVFV seroprevalence was highest in cattle (20.5%) followed by sheep 
(6.8%) then goats (3.6%). RVFV seroprevalence in northern highlands (21.8%) was 
significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in the southern lowlands (3.7%). Overall 
prevalence of abortion was (17.4%), sheep had the highest prevalence of abortion 
(7.8%) followed by goats (6.3%) and then cattle (3.3%). Species specific 
abortion prevalence was highest in Sheep (24.1%) followed by goats (18.8%) and 
then 9.7% in cattle.
CONCLUSION: RVFV is endemic in Kisoro district and livestock in the highland 
areas are more likely to be exposed to RVFV infection compared to those in the 
southern lowlands. Out breaks in livestock most likely will lead to zoonotic 
infection in Kisoro district.

Molecular Analysis of H7 Avian Influenza Viruses from Australia and New Zealand: Genetic Diversity and Relationships from 1976 to 2007,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Full-genome sequencing of 11 Australian and 1 New Zealand avian influenza A virus isolate (all subtype H7) has enabled comparison of the sequences of each of the genome segments to those of other subtype H7 avian influenza A viruses. The inference of phylogenetic relationships for each segment has been used to develop a model of the natural history of these viruses in Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin segment indicates that the Australian H7 isolates form a monophyletic clade. This pattern is consistent with the long-term, independent evolution that is, in this instance, associated with geographic regions. On the basis of the analysis of the other H7 hemagglutinin sequences, three other geographic regions for which similar monophyletic clades have been observed were confirmed. These regions are Eurasia plus Africa, North America, and South America. Analysis of the neuraminidase sequences from the H7N1, H7N3, and H7N7 genomes revealed the same region-based relationships. This pattern of independent evolution of Australian isolates is supported by the results of analysis of each of the six remaining genomic segments. These results, in conjunction with the occurrence of five different combinations of neuraminidase subtypes (H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N6, H7N7) among the 11 Australian isolates, suggest that the maintenance host(s) is nearly exclusively associated with Australia. The single lineage of Australian H7 hemagglutinin sequences, despite the occurrence of multiple neuraminidase types, suggests the existence of a genetic pool from which a variety of reassortants arise rather than the presence of a small number of stable viral clones. This pattern of evolution is likely to occur in each of the regions mentioned above.</jats:p>",0
Influence of the hepatitis C virus 3′‐untranslated region on IRES‐dependent and cap‐dependent translation initiation,"<jats:p>Translation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic RNA is directed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5′‐untranslated region (5′‐UTR), and the HCV 3′‐UTR enhances IRES activity. Since the HCV 3′‐UTR has a unique structure among 3′‐UTRs, we checked possible communication between the 5′‐ and the 3′‐UTR of HCV during translation using chimeric reporter RNAs. We show that translation directed by the HCV IRES and by the HCV‐like IRES of porcine teschovirus (PTV) which belongs to a quite distinct family of viruses (picornaviruses) or by the EMCV IRES is also enhanced by the HCV 3′‐UTR or by a poly(A)‐tail in different cell types.</jats:p>",0

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a systemic lethal disease of poultry 
caused by several subtypes of influenza A virus and classified on the basis of 
serologic reactions to hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface glycoproteins. In 
January 2016, a novel subtype of HPAI-H7N8-was diagnosed in a commercial turkey 
(Meleagris gallopavo) flock in southern Indiana. Clinical signs and history 
included increased mortality, dyspnea, head tremors, recumbency, and somnolent 
or unaware birds. Postmortem examination of six recently dead birds showed 
red-tinged mucous in the choana and trachea and marked pulmonary edema. 
Histologic lesions in the brain included severe, multifocal lymphohistiocytic 
meningoencephalitis with foci of malacia, neuronal necrosis, and neuronophagia. 
All anatomic locations of the brain were affected, although histologic changes 
in the cerebellum were considered mild. Other histologic lesions included 
pulmonary congestion and edema, splenic congestion and lymphoid depletion, 
fibrinoid necrosis of vessels within the spleen, and multifocal pancreatic 
acinar necrosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was weakly positive for influenza A 
in the brain; IHC was negative in other tissues tested. The clinical and 
pathologic characteristics of this case matched previously published material 
concerning HPAI and add to instances of known or suspected mutation of a low 
pathogenic virus to a highly pathogenic virus.

Phylogenetic analysis of HEV isolates from farmed, wild and pet rabbits in the 
Netherlands (0, 60, and 23 % respectively) showed them to be grouped amongst 
published rabbit HEV sequences and distinct from most human isolates. Dutch 
rabbits are unlikely to be a zoonotic source.

Since the spread of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in 2005, many 
surveillance programmes have been initiated in poultry and wild birds worldwide. 
This study describes for the first time the detection of different subtypes of 
avian influenza viruses (AIV) in wild birds in the West Mediterranean area 
(Catalonia, North-Eastern Spain). During a 3-year period (from mid-2006 to 
mid-2009), 1374 birds from 16 different families were examined, and a total of 
62 AIV were detected by means of a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay. 
AIV were more frequently detected in Anatidae, Phoenicopteridae, Rallidae and 
Laridae families. Of the 62 positive samples, 28 AIV could be isolated in 
embryonated eggs. All isolates were subtyped by haemagglutinin and neuraminidase 
inhibition techniques and 10 different haemagglutinins (HA) and 7 neuraminidases 
(NA) were found in 13 different subtype combinations. The most common 
combinations were H4N6 (22.2%) and H1N1 (18.5%). The HA and NA gene sequences of 
different AIV subtypes were compared and aligned with those available AIV 
strains from genome databases. Our studies on AIV phylogenetic analysis revealed 
that all AIV genes sequenced from wild birds in North-Eastern Spain clustered 
within Eurasian avian clades, including the sequences of H8, N4 and N5 genes 
analyzed for the first time in Europe. The results contribute to the 
understanding of AIV in the Mediterranean area and in Europe.

"Circulation of the rabies virus in non-hematophagous bats in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during 2001-2010","<jats:p>INTRODUCTION: Rabies is one of the most known lethal zoonosis, responsible for 55,000 human deaths per year. It is transmitted to humans mainly by the bite of domestic or wild animals infected with the virus. This paper shows the circulation of this virus in non-hematophagous bats in the City of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: A survey was performed on the number of bats that had been sent for diagnosis by the Seção de Virologia of the Instituto Municipal de Medicina Veterinária Jorge Vaitsman and were positive for rabies. The positive animals were identified, and the isolated viruses were sent for antigenic typification with indirect immunofluorescence. The results were compared with the antigenic panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: During 2001-2010, the laboratory received 555 non-hematophagous bats for rabies diagnosis, with 198 (35.7%) from Rio de Janeiro City. A total of 11 (5.5%) animals were positive for this disease. Antigenic typification revealed the predominance of variant 3 in 9 (81.8%) of the isolated viruses; 1 virus was classified as variant 4 and 1 variant was identified that segregated with the viruses in insectivorous bats. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained in this study showed the presence of the rabies virus in synanthropic populations of non-hematophagous bats in the City of Rio de Janeiro. The circulation of this agent in these animals represents a serious risk to human and animal health and requires attention and control measures by the authorities.</jats:p>",0
Molecular epidemiology of enterovirus and parechovirus infections according to patient age over a 4‐year period in Spain,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>The epidemiology and clinical association of enterovirus (EV) and parechovirus (HPeV) infections, as well as the type‐distribution‐according‐to‐age, were determined during a 4‐year study period in Spain. During 2010–2013, a total of 21,832 clinical samples were screened for EV and the detection frequency was 6.5% (1,430). Of the total EV‐negative samples, only 1,873 samples from 2011 to 2013 were available for HPeV testing. HPeV was detected in 42 (2%) of them. Positive samples were genotyped using PCR and sequencing. EV infections occurred in all age groups of patients: neonates (17%), children 28 days to 2 years (29%), children 2–14 years (40%), and adults (14%). Thirty‐four different EV types were identified. HPeV infections were detected exclusively in infants &lt;8 m (70% neonates, <jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.05). All but one HPeV were HPeV‐3. Differences in type frequency detection were found according to age and clinical manifestation. Coxsackievirus (CV)‐B4 (61%), CV‐B5 (83%), and HPeV‐3 (64%) were more frequent in neonates than in older patients (<jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.05). Echovirus (E)‐3 (60%), E‐18 (47%), E‐25 (62%), CV‐A6 (61%), CV‐A16 (72%), and EV‐71 (75%) were mainly detected in children 28 days to 2 years (<jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.05), whereas, E‐6 (79%), E‐20 (88%), and E‐30 (85%) were predominant in children &gt;2 years and adults (<jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.05). Clinically, meningitis was associated with EV (<jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.01) whereas, encephalitis was more frequent in HPeV‐infected patients.

Swine are the main host of the H1N1 swine influenza virus (SIV), however, H1N1 
can also infect humans and occasionally cause serious respiratory disease. To 
trace the evolution of the SIV in Guangdong, China, we performed an epidemic 
investigation during the period of 2016-2017. Nine H1N1 influenza viruses were 
isolated from swine nasal swabs. Antigenic analysis revealed that these viruses 
belonged to two distinct antigenic groups, represented by 
A/Swine/Guangdong/101/2016 and A/Swine/Guangdong/52/2017. Additionally, three 
genotypes, known as GD52/17-like, GD493/17-like and GD101/16-like, were 
identified by phylogenetic analysis. Importantly, the genotypes including a 
minimum of 4 pdm/09-origin internal genes have become prevalent in China in 
recent years. A total of 2966 swine serum samples were used to perform 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, and the results showed that the 
seroprevalence values of SW/GD/101/16 (32.2% in 2016, 32.1% in 2017) were 
significantly higher than the seroprevalence values of SW/GD/52/17 (18.0% in 
2016, 16.7% in 2017). Our study showed that the three reassortant genotypes of 
H1N1 SIV currently circulating in China are stable, but H1N1pdm09 poses 
challenges to human health by the introduction of internal genes into these 
reassortant genotypes. Strengthening SIV surveillance is therefore critical for 
SIV control and minimizing its potential threat to public health.

Complete genomes of four Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains, isolated from 
ducks and wild birds in Guangdong province of China from 2003 to 2007, were 
sequenced and analyzed in this study. Pathogenicity tests in chicken embryos and 
chickens illustrate that D3 and R8 are lentogenic, and W4 and P4 are mesogenic 
strains. Phylogenetic analysis using all six genes provides a high resolution 
profile for genotype designation as genotype I for D3 and R8 strains and 
genotype VI for W4 and P4 strains. In addition, molecular dating based on 
different genes suggests that D3 and R8 diverged from their common ancestor at 
around 1998; W4 and P4 diverged from their common ancestor at around 1999. 
Subsequent selective pressure analysis displayed specific traits of genes 
evolution in all 4 strains since their divergence from the recent common 
ancestor. Furthermore, the geographic origins of 4 strains were deduced to be 
from Europe via two independent introduction events by phylogeographical 
analysis. This provides insights to the potential influence of waterfowl 
migration on NDV epidemiology.

Identification and Analysis of Differentially-Expressed microRNAs in Japanese Encephalitis Virus-Infected PK-15 Cells with Deep Sequencing,"<jats:p>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne Flavivirus, causes acute viral encephalitis with high morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that are important modulators of the intricate  host-pathogen interaction networks. However, our knowledge of the changes that occur in miRNAs in host cells after JEV infection is still limited. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of JEV at the level of posttranscriptional regulation, we used Illumina deep sequencing to sequence two small RNA libraries prepared from PK-15 cells before and after JEV infection. We identified 522 and 427 miRNAs in the infected and uninfected cells, respectively. Overall, 132 miRNAs were expressed significantly differently after challenge with JEV: 78 were upregulated and 54 downregulated. The sequencing results for selected miRNAs were confirmed with RT-qPCR. GO analysis of the host target genes revealed that these dysregulated miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, including the metabolic pathway, inflammatory response and immune response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the comparative expression of miRNAs in PK-15 cells after JEV infection. Our findings will underpin further studies of miRNAs’ roles in JEV replication and identify potential candidates for antiviral therapies against JEV.</jats:p>",0

Bats, a globally distributed group of mammals with high ecological importance, 
are increasingly recognized as natural reservoir hosts for viral agents of 
significance to human and animal health. In the present study, we evaluated 
pools of blood samples obtained from two phylogenetically distant bat families, 
in particular from flying foxes (Pteropodidae), Eidolon helvum in West Africa, 
and from two species of New World leaf-nosed fruit bats (Phyllostomidae), 
Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus in Central America. A 
sequence-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination 
with high throughput sequencing to detect two novel parvoviruses: a PARV4-like 
virus named Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a 
putative new genus in Artibeus jamaicensis from Panama (Aj-BtPV-1). Those 
viruses were circulating in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7-8%. 
Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%). Both viruses were 
detected in the blood of infected animals at high concentrations: up to 10E8 and 
to 10E10 copies/ml for Aj-BtPV-1 and Eh-BtPV-1 respectively. Eh-BtPV-1 was 
additionally detected in all organs collected from bats (brain, lungs, liver, 
spleen, kidneys and intestine) and spleen and kidneys were identified as the 
most likely sites where viral replication takes place. Our study shows that bat 
parvoviruses share common ancestors with known parvoviruses of humans and 
livestock. We also provide evidence that a variety of Parvovirinae are able to 
cause active infection in bats and that they are widely distributed in these 
animals with different geographic origin, ecologies and climatic ranges.

Outbreak of swine influenza in Argentina reveals a non-contemporary human H3N2 virus highly transmissible among pigs,"<jats:p>Sporadic outbreaks of human H3N2 influenza A virus (IAV) infections in swine populations have been reported in Asia, Europe and North America since 1970. In South America, serological surveys in pigs indicate that IAVs of the H3 and H1 subtypes are currently in circulation; however, neither virus isolation nor characterization has been reported. In November 2008, an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs consistent with swine influenza virus (SIV) infection was detected in Argentina. The current study describes the clinical epidemiology, pathology, and molecular and biological characteristics of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus isolate shared nucleotide identities of 96–98 % with H3N2 IAVs that circulated in humans from 2000 to 2003. Antigenically, sera from experimentally inoculated animals cross-reacted mainly with non-contemporary human-origin H3N2 influenza viruses. In an experimental infection in a commercial swine breed, the virus was of low virulence but was transmitted efficiently to contact pigs and caused severe disease when an infected animal acquired a secondary bacterial infection. This is the first report of a wholly human H3N2 IAV associated with clinical disease in pigs in South America. These studies highlight the importance of two-way transmission of IAVs and SIVs between pigs and humans, and call for enhanced influenza surveillance in the pig population worldwide.</jats:p>",0
Newcastle disease outbreaks in Italy during 2000,"<jats:p>Among the consequences of the epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza which affected Italy between 1999 and 2000 was an epidemic of Newcastle disease in northern and central Italy. It affected industrially reared poultry, dealer flocks and backyard flocks, with a total of 254 outbreaks notified up to December 31, 2000. Virological investigations yielded virulent isolates of Newcastle disease virus, which produced intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 and which, on the basis of their monoclonal antibody binding patterns, could be classified as belonging to group Cl. The clinical, gross and microscopical findings were typical of Newcastle disease, and different avian species were susceptible to different degrees. Chickens and guinea fowl appeared to be the most susceptible, followed by pheasants, turkeys and ostriches. The epidemiological inquiry highlighted the crucial role of a broiler hatchery in initiating the epidemic, and of dealers in perpetuating it. The control measures imposed by Directive 92/66/EEC are discussed with reference to the outbreaks in backyard flocks.</jats:p>",0

Three field isolates of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) were derived from a 
mixed flock of goats and sheep certified for many years as free of caprine 
arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV). The phylogenetic analysis of pol sequences 
permitted to classify these isolates as A4 subtype. None of the animals showed 
clinical signs of SRLV infection, confirming previous observations which had 
suggested that this particular subtype is highly attenuated, at least for goats. 
A quantitative real time PCR strategy based on primers and probes derived from a 
highly variable env region permitted us to classify the animals as uninfected, 
singly or doubly infected. The performance of different serological tools based 
on this classification revealed their profound inadequacy in monitoring animals 
infected with this particular SRLV subtype. In vitro, the isolates showed 
differences in their cytopathicity and a tendency to replicate more efficiently 
in goat than sheep cells, especially in goat macrophages. By contrast, in vivo, 
these viruses reached significantly higher viral loads in sheep than in goats. 
Both env subtypes infected goats and sheep with equal efficiency. One of these, 
however, reached significantly higher viral loads in both species. In 
conclusion, we characterized three isolates of the SRLV subtype A4 that 
efficiently circulate in a mixed herd of goats and sheep in spite of their 
apparent attenuation and a strict physical separation between goats and sheep. 
The poor performance of the serological tools applied indicates that, to support 
an SRLV eradication campaign, it is imperative to develop novel, subtype 
specific tools.

An outbreak of pseudocowpox in fattening calves in southern Brazil,"<jats:p> Pseudocowpox virus is a parapoxvirus frequently associated with papulovesicular and scabby lesions on the teats and udders of milking cows and is often transmitted to human beings. An unusual outbreak of skin disease in fattening calves in southern Brazil is described. Fourteen of 17 male cattle (82%), aged 6–48 months, feeding on grass pastures were affected. Animals developed papules, vesicles, and scabby proliferative lesions on the muzzle in a clinical course of approximately 10–15 days. The scabby lesions often presented with exudation and bleeding. Histological examination of mucocutaneous tissue in detached scabs revealed acanthosis with thickening of the corneal layer and premature keratinization (parakeratotic hyperkeratosis). The dermis had multifocal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. Electron microscopic examination of scab specimens revealed typical parapoxvirus particles: oval shaped (260 nm × 160 nm), enveloped, and covered with a helical layer. Polymerase chain reaction using a set of pan-parapoxvirus primers for the B2L gene amplified a 590-bp product out of DNA extracted from scabs. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplicons revealed a nucleotide homology of 97% with Pseudocowpox virus and lower homology with other parapoxviruses: Bovine papular stomatitis virus (84%) and Orf virus (94%). A phylogenetic tree based on the B2L sequence was constructed, showing that the virus clustered with Pseudocowpox virus isolates. </jats:p>",0

In April 2014 an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 North American 
genetic lineage was diagnosed in a commercial quail operation in Stanislaus 
County, California. Sudden increase in mortality prompted the submission of 20 
Japanese quail hens (Coturnix c. japonica) to the California Animal Health and 
Food Safety Laboratory, Turlock Branch. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs tested 
positive for influenza A virus H5N8 by real-time reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The virus was subsequently isolated. In 
vivo assay and sequencing of the hemagglutinin protein cleavage site classified 
the virus as a North American genetic lineage of low pathogenicity for chickens. 
Following the diagnosis, a rapid and coordinated response took place to contain 
the outbreak. The affected premise was depopulated, cleaned, and disinfected. 
Three areas from the affected premises-a 3 kilometer (km) radius (High Risk 
Zone), a 3-10 km area (Buffer Zone), and a 10-20 km (Surveillance Zone)-were 
established for avian influenza testing of commercial and noncommercial poultry 
operations. Surveillance testing and rapid control measures were successful in 
the control and eradication of the outbreak and revealed no area of spread of 
the virus from the index flock. This report describes the history, diagnosis, 
surveillance, and control measures applied to manage this outbreak.

Cowpox virus (CPXV) is described as the source of the first vaccine used to 
prevent the onset and spread of an infectious disease. It is one of the earliest 
described members of the genus Orthopoxvirus, which includes the viruses that 
cause smallpox and monkeypox in humans. Both the historic and current literature 
describe ""cowpox"" as a disease with a single etiologic agent. Genotypic data 
presented herein indicate that CPXV is not a single species, but a composite of 
several (up to 5) species that can infect cows, humans, and other animals. The 
practice of naming agents after the host in which the resultant disease 
manifests obfuscates the true taxonomic relationships of ""cowpox"" isolates. 
These data support the elevation of as many as four new species within the 
traditional ""cowpox"" group and suggest that both wild and modern vaccine strains 
of Vaccinia virus are most closely related to CPXV of continental Europe rather 
than the United Kingdom, the homeland of the vaccine.

Cross-reactive immunity occurs when infection with or vaccination against one 
virus protects against another related family member. A search for homologues of 
the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein revealed that it is composed of thousands of 
intercalating and overlapping viral matches of pentapeptide or longer gapped 
consensi, belonging to over 70% of the currently sequenced virome, infecting all 
kingdoms from bacteria to man. It was also highly homologous to proteins from 
the Visna/Maedi and other ovine viruses, while other proteins (nef/tat/gag/pol) 
were homologous to proteins from the equine infectious anaemia virus and 
HTLV-2/HTLV-3 viruses. This phenomenon suggests that horizontal gene transfer 
from coinfecting RNA and DNA viruses to retroviruses is extensive, providing a 
route for the subsequent insertion of non-retroviral genes into human and other 
genomes via retroviral integration. This homology includes all viruses for which 
vaccines already exist. Cross-reactive immunity may be operative in AIDS, as 
Vaccinia vaccination decreases viral replication in HIV-1 infected patients' 
cells, for the CCR5 tropic form. Measles, Dengue virus, or GB virus C infections 
also decrease the HIV-1 viral load. A resumption of Vaccinia/smallpox 
vaccination might be expected to have a significant effect on the AIDS pandemic, 
and a careful study of the potential uses of other existing viral and bacterial 
vaccines merits close attention. This phenomenon may also be relevant to other 
recalcitrant viruses, bacteria, and parasites for which no vaccine exists and 
the armory of existing vaccines may have a role to play in diseases other than 
those for which they were designed.

An increase in autochthonous hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections has been 
recorded in Italy suspected to be zoonotically transmitted from pigs; this study 
was carried out to determinate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated 
with hepatitis HEV exposition, both in swine and humans working in pig farms, 
located within a high-density pig farming area in Piedmont region, north-western 
Italy. The presence of viral RNA in human and swine samples was also evaluated, 
and phylogenetic analysis was performed on HEV-positive samples. Forty-two swine 
farms were sampled; 142 workers were enrolled in the study and classified into 
two groups: (i) 69 workers with occupational contact with swine (including 
veterinarians and farmers) recruited in the 42 sampled farms; (ii) 73 without 
occupational contact with swine. Forty-one of 42 (97%) swine farms resulted 
positive to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for HEV antibodies (Abs). 
Overall seroprevalence in swine was 50% (441/879), with seropositivity rate 
higher in sows (333/469, 71%). HEV RNA in stool samples was detected in animals 
from 13 of 42 tested farms (31%), and a higher positivity resulted in weaners 
(40/246, 16.3%). Phylogenetic analysis classified all HEV isolates within 
genotype 3 (subtypes 3f, 3e, 3c). All humans were negative for HEV viral genome 
in blood. Five of 142 sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV with an overall 
prevalence of 3.52% with no statistically significant differences in prevalence 
rates between workers at zoonotic risk and the control group (5.7% versus 1.3%). 
In contrast, a significant difference (OR 10.1) was observed within the subgroup 
including subjects exposed for short periods (veterinarians) compared with those 
who worked for long periods (farmers) suggesting a correlation between the time 
of exposure and the likelihood of HEV infection. Reporting HEV infection is not 
mandatory in Italy, but a constant epidemiological surveillance should be 
ensured to clarify the epidemiology of this disease.

Bovine Papillomavirus in Brazil: Detection of Coinfection of Unusual Types by a PCR-RFLP Method,"<jats:p>Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) is recognized as a causal agent of benign and malignant tumors in cattle. Thirteen types of BPV are currently characterized and classified into three distinct genera, associated with different pathological outcomes. The described BPV types as well as other putative ones have been demonstrated by molecular biology methods, mainly by the employment of degenerated PCR primers. Specifically, divergences in the nucleotide sequence of the L1 gene are useful for the identification and classification of new papillomavirus types. On the present work, a method based on the PCR-RFLP technique and DNA sequencing was evaluated as a screening tool, allowing for the detection of two relatively rare types of BPV in lesions samples from a six-year-old Holstein dairy cow, chronically affected with cutaneous papillomatosis. These findings point to the dissemination of BPVs with unclear pathogenic potential, since two relatively rare, new described BPV types, which were first characterized in Japan, were also detected in Brazil.</jats:p>",0
Human hepatitis E virus circulation in Bulgaria: Deep Bayesian phylogenetic analysis for viral spread control in the country,"<jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in Bulgaria is endemic, as demonstrated by the seroprevalence of antibody against the virus in the general population and by the high prevalence of clinical cases registered. In this study, a deep Bayesian phylogenetic analysis has been performed to provide information on the genetic diversity and the spread of HEV genotypes in Bulgaria. Three different data sets of HEV virus was built for genotyping by the maximum likelihood method, for evolutionary rate estimated by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, for demographic history investigation and for selective pressure analysis. The evolutionary rate for genotype 3e, was 351 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> substitution/site/year (95% highest posterior density [95% HPD]: 145 × 10
<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>‐575 × 10
<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>). The root of the time to the most recent common ancestor of the Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree of HEV 3e genotype corresponded to 1965 (HPD 95% 1949‐1994). The Bulgarian sequences mainly clustered in the main clade (clade A). The monophyletic clade included all Bulgarian genotype 3e sequences. The demographic history showed a slight growth from 1995 to 2000, followed by a sort of bottleneck in 2010s, a peak in 2011 and a new growth to 2015. Selection pressure analysis did not show sites under positive pressure but 64 statistically significant sites under negative selection. Molecular epidemiological surveillance by Bayesian phylogeny of HEV virus can contribute to trace the way of human infection after contact with swine source directly or heating meat improving public health control.</jats:p>",0

Twenty-four isolates of classical swine fever (CSF) virus which were obtained 
from CSF outbreaks during 1988 and 2003 in the Republic of Korea were 
genetically characterized for partial E2 gene (190 nucleotides) and compared 
with CSF viruses reported by other countries. Phylogenetic analyses classified 
Korean field isolates between1988 and 1999 into subgroup 3.2, forming an 
independent clade distinct from CSF viruses identified in other countries. In 
contrast, the viruses isolated during 2002-2003 CSF epidemics were classified 
into a different subgroup (2.1). The 2.1 viruses showed a close genetic 
relationship (92.1-100% nucleotide similarity) with CSF viruses reported from 
China and Taiwan in 1998-2001. As no evidence of CSF virus infection was 
detected in the wild boar (Sus scrofa coreanus) population that inhabits Korea, 
the results of molecular characterization strongly suggest that CSF epidemic 
outbreaks in Korean swine populations during 2002-2003 were attributed to the 
introduction of a new strain or strains, likely from neighboring countries.

Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is an arthropod-borne disease caused by bovine 
ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), a negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus. BEFV 
is endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions including Thailand, a country in 
mainland Southeast Asia. However, there are few studies on BEFV and no available 
information regarding molecular characteristics of BEFV in Thailand. Therefore, 
the aims of this study were to genetically characterize Thai BEFVs and reveal 
their evolutions by phylogenetic analysis of G gene ectodomain sequences. From 
2013 to 2017, blood samples were collected from bovine that matched with BEF 
case definition from three regions of Thailand. Thai BEFV G genes and a whole 
genome of an isolate, East Asia/TH/LRI0045/2016, were sequenced and 
characterized. Additionally, their phylogenies were constructed. This is the 
first report on genetics of BEFV in Southeast Asia. G ectodomain encoding region 
of Thai BEFV found during 2013-2017 are closely related to the second and third 
sub-clades of East Asia lineage. In addition, we observed mutation in the 
putative P' ORF of all Thai BEFVs which generated a premature stop codon. Thai G 
gene sequences are closely related to those of mainland Chinese and Taiwanese 
isolates. The whole genomic sequences of Thai BEFV and East 
Asia/China/JT02 L/2002 possess common characteristics, suggesting shared 
evolutionary relationship between East and Southeast Asian strains. Further 
studies on relationship between animal translocation, circulation of BEFV in 
Greater Mekong subregion and acquisition of more G gene sequences may improve 
understanding of BEFV epidemiology in mainland Southeast Asia.

Although dairy manure is widely applied to land, it is relatively understudied 
compared to other livestock as a potential source of antibiotic resistance genes 
(ARGs) to the environment and ultimately to human pathogens. Ceftiofur, the most 
widely used antibiotic used in U.S. dairy cows, is a 3rd generation 
cephalosporin, a critically important class of antibiotics to human health. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of typical ceftiofur 
antibiotic treatment on the prevalence of ARGs in the fecal microbiome of dairy 
cows using a metagenomics approach. β-lactam ARGs were found to be elevated in 
feces from Holstein cows administered ceftiofur (n = 3) relative to control cows 
(n = 3). However, total numbers of ARGs across all classes were not measurably 
affected by ceftiofur treatment, likely because of dominance of unaffected 
tetracycline ARGs in the metagenomics libraries. Functional analysis via MG-RAST 
further revealed that ceftiofur treatment resulted in increases in gene 
sequences associated with ""phages, prophages, transposable elements, and 
plasmids"", suggesting that this treatment also enriched the ability to 
horizontally transfer ARGs. Additional functional shifts were noted with 
ceftiofur treatment (e.g., increase in genes associated with stress, chemotaxis, 
and resistance to toxic compounds; decrease in genes associated with metabolism 
of aromatic compounds and cell division and cell cycle), along with measureable 
taxonomic shifts (increase in Bacterioidia and decrease in Actinobacteria). This 
study demonstrates that ceftiofur has a broad, measureable and immediate effect 
on the cow fecal metagenome. Given the importance of 3rd generation 
cephalospirins to human medicine, their continued use in dairy cattle should be 
carefully considered and waste treatment strategies to slow ARG dissemination 
from dairy cattle manure should be explored.

Birds, the only living member of the Dinosauria clade, are flying warm-blooded 
vertebrates displaying high species biodiversity, roosting and migratory 
behavior, and a unique adaptive immune system. Birds provide the natural 
reservoir for numerous viral species and therefore gene source for evolution, 
emergence and dissemination of novel viruses. The intrusions of human into 
natural habitats of wild birds, the domestication of wild birds as pets or 
racing birds, and the increasing poultry consumption by human have facilitated 
avian viruses to cross species barriers to cause zoonosis. Recently, a novel 
adenovirus was exclusively found in birds causing an outbreak of Chlamydophila 
psittaci infection among birds and humans. Instead of being the primary cause of 
an outbreak by jumping directly from bird to human, a novel avian virus can be 
an augmenter of another zoonotic agent causing the outbreak. A comprehensive 
avian virome will improve our understanding of birds' evolutionary dynamics.

An outbreak of contagious ecthyma in goats in central Taiwan was investigated. 
The disease was diagnosed by physical and histopathologic examinations, and the 
etiology of the disease was identified as orf virus by electron microscopy and 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence of major envelope protein (B2L) 
gene. The entire protein-coding region of B2L gene were cloned and sequenced. 
Phylogenetic analysis of B2L amino acid sequences showed that the orf virus 
identified in this outbreak was closer to the Indian ORFV-Mukteswar 59/05 
isolate. This is the first report on the molecular characterization of orf virus 
in Taiwan.

"Analysis of genomic sequences of 95 papillomavirus types: uniting typing, phylogeny, and taxonomy","<jats:p>Our aim was to study the phylogenetic relationships of all known papillomaviruses (PVs) and the possibility of establishing a supratype taxonomic classification based on this information. Of the many detectably homologous segments present in PV genomes, a 291-bp segment of the L1 gene is notable because it is flanked by the MY09 and MY11 consensus primers and contains highly conserved amino acid residues which simplify sequence alignment. We determined the MY09-MY11 sequences of human PV type 20 (HPV-20), HPV-21, HPV-22, HPV-23, HPV-24, HPV-36, HPV-37, HPV-38, HPV-48, HPV-50, HPV-60, HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, ovine (sheep) PV, bovine PV type 3 (BPV-3), BPV-5, and BPV-6 and created a database which now encompasses HPV-1 to HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, seven yet untyped HPV genomes, and 15 animal PV types. Three additional animal PVs were analyzed on the basis of other sequence data. We constructed phylogenies based on partial L1 and E6 gene sequences and distinguished five major clades that we call supergroups. One of them unites 54 genital PV types, which can be further divided into eleven groups. The second supergroup has 24 types and unites most PVs that are typically found in epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients but also includes several types typical of other cutaneous lesions, like HPV-4. The third supergroup unites the six known ungulate fibropapillomaviruses, the fourth includes the cutaneous ungulate PVs BPV-3, BPV-4, and BPV-6, and the fifth includes HPV-1, HPV-41, HPV-63, the canine oral PV, and the cottontail rabbit PV. The chaffinch PV and two rodent PVs, Micromys minutus PV and Mastomys natalensis PV, are left ungrouped because of the relative isolation of each of their lineages. Within most supergroups, groups formed on the basis of cladistic principles unite phenotypically similar PV types. We discuss the basis of our classification, the concept of the PV type, speciation, PV-host evolution, and estimates of their rates of evolution.</jats:p>",0

This communication reports full genome sequencing of the bluetongue virus-1 
(BTV-1) isolate MKD20/08/Ind from goat in northern India. The total BTV-1 genome 
size was found to be 19,190bp. A comparison study between the Indian isolate and 
other global isolates revealed that it belongs to the 'Eastern' BTV topotype. 
The full genome sequence of BTV-1 will provide vital information on its 
geographical origin and it will also be proved useful for comparing the Indian 
isolate with global isolates from other host species.

This study was conducted to identify unique nucleotide differences in two U.S. 
chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines [LT Blen (GenBank accession: JQ083493) 
designated as vaccine 1; Laryngo-Vac(®) (GenBank accession: JQ083494) designated 
as vaccine 2] of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) genomes compared to 
an Australian Serva vaccine reference ILTV genome sequence [Gallid herpesvirus 1 
(GaHV-1); GenBank accession number: HQ630064]. Genomes of the two vaccine ILTV 
strains were sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyzer 2X of 36 cycles of 
single-end reads. Results revealed that few nucleotide differences (23 in 
vaccine 1; 31 in vaccine 2) were found and indicate that the US CEO strains are 
practically identical to the Australian Serva CEO strain, which is a 
European-origin vaccine. The sequence differences demonstrated the spectrum of 
variability among vaccine strains. Only eight amino acid differences were found 
in ILTV proteins including UL54, UL27, UL28, UL20, UL1, ICP4, and US8 in vaccine 
1. Similarly, in vaccine 2, eight amino acid differences were found in UL54, 
UL27, UL28, UL36, UL1, ICP4, US10, and US8. Further comparison of US CEO 
vaccines to several ILTV genome sequences revealed that US CEO vaccines are 
genetically close to both the Serva vaccine and 63140/C/08/BR (GenBank 
accession: HM188407) and are distinct from the two Australian-origin CEO 
vaccines, SA2 (GenBank accession: JN596962) and A20 (GenBank accession: 
JN596963), which showed close similarity to each other. These data demonstrate 
the potential of high-throughput sequencing technology to yield insight into the 
sequence variation of different ILTV strains. This information can be used to 
discriminate between vaccine ILTV strains and further, to identify newly 
emerging mutant strains of field isolates.

The largest epidemic of avian influenza (AI) in history attacked poultry and 
wild birds throughout Taiwan starting January 6, 2015. This study analyzed 
surveillance results, epidemiologic characteristics, and viral sequences by 
using government-released information, with the intention to provide 
recommendations to minimize future pandemic influenza. The H5 clade 2.3.4.4 
highly pathogenic AI viruses (HPAIVs) had not been detected in Taiwan before 
2015. During this epidemic, four types of etiologic agents were identified: the 
three novel subtypes H5N2, H5N8, and H5N3 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs and one endemic 
chicken H5N2 subtype (Mexican-like lineage) of low pathogenic AI viruses. 
Cocirculation of mixed subtypes also occurred, with H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs 
accompanied by the H5N8 and H5N3 subtypes or old H5N2 viruses in the same farm. 
More than 90% of domestic geese died from this AI epidemic; geese were affected 
the most at the early outbreaks. The epidemic peaked in mid-January for all 
three novel H5 subtypes. Spatial epidemiology found that most affected areas 
were located in southwestern coastal areas. In terrestrial poultry (mostly 
chickens), different geographic distributions of AI virus subtypes were 
detected, with hot spots of H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 vs. past-endemic old H5N2 viruses 
in Changhwa (P = 0.03) and Yunlin (P = 0.007) counties, respectively, of central 
Taiwan. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses of all the early 10 Taiwan H5 clade 
2.3.4.4 isolates covering the three subtypes showed that they were very 
different from the HA of the past local H5 viruses from domestic ducks (75%-80%) 
and chickens (70%-75%). However, they had the highest sequence identity 
percentages (99.53%-100%), with the HA of A/crane/Kagoshima/KU13/2014(H5N8) 
isolated on December 7, 2014, in Japan being higher than those of recent 
American and Korean H5 HPAIVs [A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 (H5N2) 
and A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 (H5N8): 99.02%-99.54% and A/Baikal 
teal/Korea/Donglim3/2014 (H5N8): 98.61%-99.08%], implying a likely common 
ancestor of these H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses. The multiple subtypes of H5 clade 
2.3.4.4 HPAIVs imply high viral reassortment. We recommend establishing an 
integrated surveillance system, involving clinical, virologic, and serologic 
surveillance in poultry and wild birds, swine and other mammals prevalent on 
multiple-animal mixed-type traditional farms, and high-risk human populations, 
as a crucially important step to minimize future pandemic influenza.

Dual Infection of Gnotobiotic Calves with Bovine Strains of Group A and Porcine-Like Group C Rotaviruses Influences Pathogenesis of the Group C Rotavirus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>There is serological evidence that bovine group C rotaviruses exist in the United States, but there are no reports of their isolation. Ninety fecal samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from healthy adult cows were tested for group C rotaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immune electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Three samples from adult cow diarrhea cases were positive only by RT-PCR, and a group C rotavirus was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney (MA104) cells (WD534tc/C). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden porcine group C strain than to the Shintoku bovine strain. Because the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual-rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis and host adaptation of rotaviruses. Thus, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or combined with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotaviruses in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea without (or with limited) virus shedding in inoculated calves (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 3). In contrast, all calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 3) developed diarrhea but did not shed either virus. Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), whereas dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more-widespread small intestinal lesions occurred in calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotaviruses enhanced fecal shedding of a bovine group C rotavirus and the extent of histopathological lesions in the small intestines. Thus, our findings suggest a potential novel hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species.</jats:p>",0
"Torque Teno Mini Virus Infection in Chronic Cervicitis and Cervical Tumors in Isfahan, Iran","<jats:p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) is classified as the &lt;i&gt;Betatorquevirus&lt;/i&gt; genus of &lt;i&gt;Anelloviridae&lt;/i&gt;. Little is known about the prevalence of TTMV in humans. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women. This study aimed to estimate the TTMV infection frequency in cervicitis cases and cervical tumors including intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma, and the possible role of this virus in the etiology of them in an Isfahan population. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 79 cervicitis cases and 42 tumors were collected from histopathological files of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. DNA was extracted and subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Totally 62% of the tested samples were positive for TTMV. It was positive in 52.4% of adenocarcinoma, 68.4% of CIN and 100% SCC cases. In cervicitis, 48% of the cases were positive. In the phylogenetic construct two of the cervical tumor isolates and two of the cervicitis isolates were placed in the same cluster with already reported isolates from Japan (EF538880 and AB041962). Also, three of the cervical tumors isolated (JQ734980, JQ734981 and JQ734982) were placed in another cluster. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The presence of the virus in cervical tissues suggests possible sexual transmission of the virus.</jats:p>",0
Transfer of Viral Communities between Human Individuals during Fecal Microbiota Transplantation,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Clostridium difficile</jats:named-content>
            infections. However, concerns persist about unwanted cotransfer of pathogenic microbes such as viruses. Here we studed FMT from a single healthy human donor to three pediatric ulcerative colitis patients, each of whom received a course of 22 to 30 FMT treatments. Viral particles were purified from donor and recipient stool samples and sequenced; the reads were then assembled into contigs corresponding to viral genomes or partial genomes. Transfer of selected viruses was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Viral contigs present in the donor could be readily detected in recipients, with up to 32 different donor viral contigs appearing in a recipient sample. Reassuringly, none of these were viruses are known to replicate on human cells. Instead, viral contigs either scored as bacteriophage or could not be attributed taxonomically, suggestive of unstudied phage. The two most frequently transferred gene types were associated with temperate-phage replication. In addition, members of
            <jats:italic>Siphoviridae</jats:italic>
            , the group of typically temperate phages that includes phage lambda, were found to be transferred with significantly greater efficiency than other groups. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the temperate-phage replication style may promote efficient phage transfer between human individuals. In summary, we documented transfer of multiple viral lineages between human individuals through FMT, but in this case series, none were from viral groups known to infect human cells.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Transfer of whole communities of viruses between humans has rarely been studied but is of likely medical importance. Here we studied fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly successful treatment for relapsing
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Clostridium difficile</jats:named-content>
            infection and, potentially, other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We investigated the transfer of viral communities during FMT and documented transfer of multiple viral lineages between humans. None of these were viruses that replicated on animal cells or that are known to be pathogenic. We found that temperate bacteriophage, which form stable associations with their hosts, were significantly more likely to be transferred during FMT. This supports a model in which the viral temperate replication style may have evolved in part to support efficient viral transmission between environments.

Complete Genome Sequence of Newcastle Disease Virus Mesogenic Vaccine Strain R2B from India,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Mesogenic vaccine strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are widely used in many countries of Asia and Africa to control the Newcastle disease of poultry. In India, the mesogenic strain R2B was introduced in 1945; it protects adult chickens that have been preimmunized with a lentogenic vaccine virus and provides long-lasting immunity. In this article, we report the complete genome sequence of the hitherto unsequenced Indian vaccine virus strain R2B. The viral genome is 15,186 nucleotides in length and contains the polybasic amino acid motif in the fusion protein cleavage site, indicating that this vaccine strain has evolved from a virulent virus. Phylogenetic analysis of this mesogenic vaccine virus classified it with the viruses belonging to genotype III of the class cluster II of NDV.</jats:p>",0
Minimum Core Genome Sequence Typing of Bacterial Pathogens: a Unified Approach for Clinical and Public Health Microbiology,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bacterial pathogens impose a heavy health burden worldwide. In the new era of high-throughput sequencing and online bioinformatics, real-time genome typing of infecting agents, and in particular those with potential severe clinical outcomes, holds promise for guiding clinical care to limit the detrimental effects of infections and to prevent potential local or global outbreaks. Here, we sequenced and compared 85 isolates of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Streptococcus suis</jats:named-content>
            , a zoonotic human and swine pathogen, wherein we analyzed 32 recognized serotypes and 75 sequence types representing the diversity of the species and the human clinical isolates with high public health significance. We found that 1,077 of the 2,469 genes are shared by all isolates. Excluding 201 common but mobile genes, 876 genes were defined as the minimum core genome (MCG) of the species. Of 190,894 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, 58,501 were located in the MCG genes and were referred to as MCG SNPs. A population structure analysis of these MCG SNPs classified the 85 isolates into seven MCG groups, of which MCG group 1 includes all isolates from human infections and outbreaks. Our MCG typing system for
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">S. suis</jats:named-content>
            provided a clear separation of groups containing human-associated isolates from those containing animal-associated isolates. It also separated the group containing outbreak isolates, including those causing life-threatening streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, from sporadic or less severe meningitis or bacteremia-only isolates. The typing system facilitates the application of genome data to the fields of clinical medicine and epidemiology and to the surveillance of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">S. suis</jats:named-content>
            . The MCG groups may also be used as the taxonomical units of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">S. suis</jats:named-content>
            to define bacterial subpopulations with the potential to cause severe clinical infections and large-scale outbreaks.

BACKGROUND: Zoonotic Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis), 
causing paratyphoid in pigs and bacteremia in humans, commonly carry a virulence 
plasmid and sometimes a separate antimicrobial-resistant plasmid or merging 
together. This study aimed to analyze the likely mechanism of how to form a 
virulence-resistance chimera of plasmid in S. Choleraesuis.
METHODS: Whole plasmid sequence of pOU7519 in S. Choleraesuis strain OU7519 was 
determined using shotgun cloning and sequencing. Sequence annotation and 
comparison were performed to determine the sequence responsible for the 
formation of a chimeric virulence-resistance pOU7519. Other chimeric plasmids 
among the collected strains of S. Choleraesuis were also confirmed.
RESULTS: The sequence of pOU719, 127,212 bp long, was identified to be a chimera 
of the virulence plasmid pSCV50 and a multidrug-resistant plasmid pSC138 that 
have been found in S. Choleraesuis strain SC-B67. The pOU7519 is a conjugative 
plasmid carrying various mobile DNAs, including prophages, insertion sequences, 
integrons and transposons, especially a Tn6088-like transposon. By dissecting 
the junction site of the pSCV50-pSC138 chimera in pOU7519, defective sequences 
at integrase gene scv50 (int) and its attachment site (att) were found, and that 
likely resulted in a stable chimera plasmid due to the failure of excision from 
the pSCV50-pSC138 chimera. Similar structure of chimera was also found in other 
large plasmids.
CONCLUSION: The deletion of both the int and att sties could likely block 
chimera excision, and result in an irreversible, stable pSCV50-pSC138 chimera. 
The emergence of conjugative virulence and antimicrobial-resistant plasmids in 
S. Choleraesuis could pose a threat to health public.

Complete genome characterization of a rotavirus B (RVB) strain identified in Alpine goat kids with enteritis reveals inter-species transmission with RVB bovine strains,"<jats:p>Rotavirus B (RVB) has been associated with enteric disease in many animal species. An RVB strain was identified in pooled intestinal samples from Alpine caprine kids (between 2 and 3 days of age) experiencing high (&gt;90 %) morbidity, and the complete caprine RVB genome was characterized. Histology revealed villus atrophy, the samples tested positive for RVB by real-time RT-PCR and metagenomic next-generation sequencing identified only RVB and orf virus. In the VP4 gene segment, the caprine RVB strain had a higher percentage nucleotide identity to the Indian bovine RVB strains than to the Japanese bovine RVB strains, but the VP7, VP6, VP2, NSP1, NSP2 and NSP5 gene segments of the American caprine RVB strain were genetically related to the Japanese bovine RVB strains. The results indicate a lack of RVB sequences to understand reassortment or the evolutionary relationship of RVB strains from cattle and goats.</jats:p>",0
Evolutionary Relationships among Large Double-Stranded DNA Viruses That Infect Microalgae and Other Organisms as Inferred from DNA Polymerase Genes,"1. Virology. 1996 May 1;219(1):170-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0234.

In order to examine genetic relatedness among viruses that infect microalgae, 
DNA polymerase gene (DNA pol) fragments were amplified and sequenced from 13 
virus clones that infect three genera of distantly related microalgae (Chlorella 
strains NC64A and Pbi, Micromonas pusilla and Chrysochromulina spp.). 
Phylogenetic trees based on DNA pol sequences and hybridization of total genomic 
DNA showed similar branching patterns. Genetic relatedness calculated from the 
hybridization and sequence data showed good concordance (r=0.90), indicating 
that DNA pol sequences can be used to determine genetic relatedness and infer 
phylogenetic relationships among these viruses. The phylogenetic tree inferred 
from the deduced amino acid sequences of DNA pol from 24 dsDNA viruses, 
including phycodnaviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses, baculoviruses, and African 
swine fever virus corresponded well with groupings based on the International 
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Microalgal viruses are more closely related to 
each other than to the other dsDNA viruses and form a distinct phyletic group, 
suggesting that they share a common ancestor and belong to the Phycodnaviridae. 
Moreover, the Phycodnaviridae are more closely related to the Herpesviridae than 
to other virus families for which DNA pol sequences are available.

Avian leukemia subgroup J (ALV-J) is one of the most detrimental neoplastic 
diseases in poultry production. However, the differences between somatic cells 
and immune cells post-infection remain poorly understood. The aim of our study 
was to detect the different responses in chicken to infection with ALV-J in 
different cell lines. In this study, we detected transcriptome expression 
changes during infection with ALV-J in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) and HD11 
cell lines. RNA-Seq was used to determine the expression levels of mRNA 
transcripts from the two cell types after infection with ALV-J at 1, 4, and 
7 dpi, and gene ontology analyses were used to cluster differentially expressed 
genes into pathways. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the expression of 336 
and 269 differentially expressed genes in CEF and HD11 lines, respectively, 
involved in innate immunity (OASL, CCL4), adaptive immunity (LYZ, CD72), 
apoptosis and autophagy (WISP2, COMP), inflammation (JSC, IL8), and tumorgenesis 
(PCNA, GPX3). The notable signal transduction pathways included the PPARs 
signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interactions in CEF, and the Toll-like 
receptor, NOD-like receptor, and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways in HD11. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use high-throughput sequencing 
methods to investigate viral infection in different cell types. The results of 
the present study form a foundation for developing potential biological markers 
for viral infection.

The rapid discovery of novel viruses using next generation sequencing (NGS) 
technologies including DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq, has greatly expanded our 
understanding of viral diversity in recent years. The timely identification of 
novel viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control 
emerging infectious diseases caused by novel viruses. In this study, we 
identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct with chicken infectious 
bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a 
potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by 
sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also performed a survey of 
CoVs in domestic fowls in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV 
positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral 
N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several 
region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can 
infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. 
Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some 
host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and 
indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this 
study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls. Taken 
together, this study shed new insight into the diversity, distribution, 
evolution and control of avian CoVs.

Thirteen isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 
from different provinces of China were studied and compared with several PRRSV 
isolates from other countries. Phylogenetic analysis shows that all Chinese 
isolates of PRRSV in this study belong to the American genotype, except for one 
strain, B13, which clustered as a European genotype. Sequence analysis revealed 
that PRRSV Chinese isolates of the American genotype were highly similar in the 
ORF5 sequence and could be classified into two subclades. One contains PRRSV 
isolates that are more closely related to the American vaccine strain MLV Resp 
and its parent strain VR-2332, and the other contains ones only distantly 
related to them. Within the Chinese isolates slight genetic variation occurred, 
and some strains may originate directly from the vaccine virus.

Since early 2006, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been reemerging in 
immunized swine herds. Open reading frame 3 (ORF3) is the only accessory gene in 
the PEDV genome. The entire ORF3 genes of 12 PEDV field strains and one vaccine 
strain were sequenced. The ORF3 genes of Chinese PEDV field strains (excluding 
CH/GSJIII/07) contain a single 672- or 675-nucleotide (nt) ORF, which encodes a 
223- or 224-aa-long peptide. However, the CV777 vaccine strain and CH/GSJIII/07 
contain a 276-nt ORF because of a 49-nt deletion at nt 245-293. The Chinese PEDV 
field strains and PEDV reference strains are divided into three groups based on 
the phylogenetic relationship of their ORF3 genes. Chinese PEDV field strains 
(excluding CH/GSJIII/07) have a close phylogenetic relationship to Korean 
strains and are genetically different from the PEDV vaccine strains. However, 
CH/GSJIII/07 has a close phylogenetic relationship to two vaccine strains, 
suggesting that it might have evolved from a live vaccine strain. Chinese PEDV 
field strains (excluding CH/GSJIII/07) can be differentiated from PEDV vaccine 
strains by a nested RT-PCR method.

Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes colibacillosis, which results in 
significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Due to the drug 
residues and increased antibiotic resistance caused by antibiotic use, 
bacteriophages and other alternative therapeutic agents are expected to control 
APEC infection in poultry. Two APEC phages, named P483 and P694, were isolated 
from the feces from the farmers market in China. We then studied their 
biological properties, and carried out high-throughput genome sequencing and 
homology analyses of these phages. Assembly results of high-throughput 
sequencing showed that the structures of both P483 and P694 genomes consist of 
linear and double-stranded DNA. Results of the electron microscopy and homology 
analysis revealed that both P483 and P694 belong to T7-like virus which is a 
member of the Podoviridae family of the Caudovirales order. Comparative genomic 
analysis showed that most of the predicted proteins of these two phages showed 
strongest sequence similarity to the Enterobacteria phages BA14 and 285P, 
Erwinia phage FE44, and Kluyvera phage Kvp1; however, some proteins such as 
gp0.6a, gp1.7 and gp17 showed lower similarity (<85%) with the homologs of other 
phages in the T7 subgroup. We also found some unique characteristics of P483 and 
P694, such as the two types of the genes of P694 and no lytic activity of P694 
against its host bacteria in liquid medium. Our results serve to further our 
understanding of phage evolution of T7-like coliphages and provide the potential 
application of the phages as therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases.

BACKGROUND: Emergence and re-emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) 
in North America, Asia and Europe has caused severe economic loss to the global 
swine industry. However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on 
disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have 
made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites 
for any host.
METHODS: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in 
PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on 
next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab 
samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015-2016 were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence 
of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including 
Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 
67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 
28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus 
(3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone 
whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an 
extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, 
Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae.

"A novel astrovirus species in the gut of yaks with diarrhoea in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, 2013","<jats:p>The yak (<jats:italic>Bos grunniens</jats:italic>) is an iconic symbol in the high-altitude region of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Diarrhoea is a common disease in yaks, resulting in major economic losses. To investigate the diversity of viral species, we reported the metagenomics-derived virome in a pooled faecal sample of 20 diarrhoeic yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhoeic samples, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, were influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared with healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrhoeal samples, indicating a correlation with the clinical symptoms of diarrhoea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a near-full genome was obtained from a diarrhoeic sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4–66.2 % similarity with other related bovine AstVs from faeces. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome demonstrated that the yak AstV fell within the bovine AstVs cluster, but was located in a unique lineage, suggesting a novel AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had closer similarity and genetically relationship with deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than that of the bovine AstVs.

Retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) can recognize influenza viruses and evoke 
the innate immune response. RIG-I is absent in the chicken genome, but is 
conserved in the genome of ducks. Lack of RIG-I renders chickens more 
susceptible to avian influenza infection, and the clinical symptoms are more 
prominent than in other poultry. It is unknown whether introduction of duck 
RIG-I into chicken cells can establish the immunity as is seen in ducks and the 
role of RIG-I in established immunity is unknown. In this study, a chicken cell 
strain with stable expression of duRIG-I was established by lentiviral 
infection, giving DF1/LV5-RIG-I, and a control strain DF1/LV5 was established in 
parallel. To verify stable, high level expression of duRIG-I in DF1 cells, the 
levels of duRIG-I mRNA and protein were determined by real-time RT-PCR and 
Western blot, respectively. Further, 5'triphosphate double stranded RNA 
(5'ppp-dsRNA) was used to mimic an RNA virus infection and the infected 
DF1/LV5-RIG-I and DF1/LV5 cells were subjected to high-throughput 
RNA-sequencing, which yielded 193.46 M reads and 39.07 G bases. A total of 278 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), i.e., duRIG-I-mediated responsive genes, 
were identified by RNA-seq. Among the 278 genes, 120 DEGs are annotated in the 
KEGG database, and the most reliable KEGG pathways are likely to be the 
signaling pathways of RIG-I like receptors. Functional analysis by Gene ontology 
(GO) indicates that the functions of these DEGs are primarily related to Type I 
interferon (IFN) signaling, IFN-β-mediated cellular responses and up-regulation 
of the RIG-I signaling pathway. Based on the shared genes among different 
pathways, a network representing crosstalk between RIG-I and other signaling 
pathways was constructed using Cytoscape software. The network suggests that 
RIG-mediated pathway may crosstalk with the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, 
Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, ubiquitin-mediated 
proteolysis and MAPK signaling pathway during the transduction of antiviral 
signals. After screening, a group of key responsive genes in RIG-I-mediated 
signaling pathways, such as ISG12-2, Mx1, IFIT5, TRIM25, USP18, STAT1, STAT2, 
IRF1, IRF7 and IRF8, were tested for differential expression by real-time 
RT-PCR. In summary, by combining our results and the current literature, we 
propose a RIG-I-mediated signaling network in chickens.

A novel virulent bacteriophage, vB_BbrM_PHB04, infecting Bordetella 
bronchiseptica was isolated from wastewater collected at a swine farm in China. 
Phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 exhibited growth over a wide range of temperature and pH 
conditions and showed different efficiency of plating values and lytic spectra 
within the same strains at 25 °C and 37 °C. High-throughput sequencing revealed 
that vB_BbrM_PHB04 has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with 124 putative 
open reading frames. Overall, the genome of vB_BbrM_PHB04 showed very low 
similarity (the highest nucleotide identity 82%, 1% coverage) to other phage 
sequences in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 
vB_BbrM_PHB04 is a new member of the family Myoviridae. In addition, polymerase 
chain reaction-based detection of phage genes in phage-resistant B. 
bronchiseptica variants revealed no evidence of lysogenic activity of phage 
vB_BbrM_PHB04.

The pandemic A/H1N1 influenza viruses emerged in both Mexico and the United 
States in March 2009, and were transmitted efficiently in the human population. 
They were transmitted occasionally from humans to other mammals including pigs, 
dogs and cats. In this study, we report the isolation and genetic analysis of 
novel viruses in pigs in China. These viruses were related phylogenetically to 
the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses isolated from humans and pigs, which 
indicates that the pandemic virus is currently circulating in swine populations, 
and this hypothesis was further supported by serological surveillance of pig 
sera collected within the same period. Furthermore, we isolated another two H1N1 
viruses belonging to the lineages of classical swine H1N1 virus and avian-like 
swine H1N1 virus, respectively. Multiple genetic lineages of H1N1 viruses are 
co-circulating in the swine population, which highlights the importance of 
intensive surveillance for swine influenza in China.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most 
economically important diseases in swine caused by porcine reproductive and 
respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Genome sequences of sixty-six PRRSV strains 
were obtained using metagenomic sequencing of serum samples collected in the 
U.S. in 2014 to explore contemporary genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of 
the genes encoding the envelope proteins identified four to eight distinct 
lineages with >87% intraclade identity. To explore the effect of the observed 
genetic diversity on antigenicity, the genome regions encoding either 
GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M in strain SD95-21 were replaced with alleles from each of 
eight distinct PRRSV strains using reverse genetics. The GP2a-GP3-GP4 region 
from only four of the eight strains yielded viable recombinant virus. When 
viable, both GP2a-GP3-GP4 and GP5-M variably affected antigenicity. A 
strain-dependent significant loss in cross reactivity was variably observed by 
indirect immunofluorescence assays using antisera from pigs vaccinated with 
commercial modified-live vaccines following replacement of GP2a-GP3-GP4 or 
GP5-M. Significantly reduced neutralization titers were similarly measured using 
antisera from naturally PRRSV-exposed pigs. These results illustrate the need to 
consider genomic regions besides GP5 for PRRSV epidemiology and vaccination.

Rabies a fatal viral zoonosis is endemic in India. There is no report on 
phylogenetic study of Indian rabies virus isolates based on the complete G gene. 
In the present study, a total of 25 rabies positive brain samples collected 
during 2001-2014 from North India (UP, MP, Delhi, Rajasthan), South India 
(Kerala and Karnataka) and Gujarat states belonging to six different host 
species were subjected to G gene amplification by RT-PCR as three overlapping 
fragments of 881 bp, 991 bp and 618 bp. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 
Indian rabies virus isolates are genetically closely related with Arctic-like 1a 
lineage viruses. However, two distinct clusters were identified namely, India 
South and India North. All the Indian rabies isolates had 95.5-100% homology 
related to geography, but not to host species. Deduced amino acids on comparison 
revealed two amino acid changes, aa 356 in ECTO; N→K and aa 458; M→I, which were 
found to distinguish between the India South and India North isolates.

Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a rapidly evolving, single-stranded RNA 
virus and a production limiting pathogen of cattle worldwide. 79 viral isolates 
collected between 1997 and 2013 in Canada were subjected to next-generation 
sequencing. Bayesian phylogenetics was used to assess the evolution of this 
virus. A mean substitution rate of 1.4×10-3 substitutions/site/year was found 
across both BVDV1 and BVDV2. Evolutionary rates in the E2 gene were slightly 
faster than other regions. We also identified population structures below the 
sub-genotype level that likely have phenotypic implications. Two distinct 
clusters within BVDV2a are present and can be differentiated, in part, by a 
tyrosine to isoleucine mutation at position 963 in the E2 protein, a position 
implicated in the antigenicity of BVDV1 isolates. Distinct clustering within all 
sub-genotypes, particularly BVDV2a, is apparent and could lead to new levels of 
genotypic classification. Continuous monitoring of emerging variants is 
therefore necessary.

Metagenomic analysis of fecal samples collected from diarrheal swine detected 
sequences encoding a replication initiator protein (Rep). The genomes of ten 
novel single-stranded DNA viruses were determined, and they exhibited a similar 
genome organization. The two putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding Rep 
and the capsid protein are bidirectionally transcribed and separated by two 
intergenic regions. Stem-loop structure(s) typical of genomes that undergo the 
rolling-circle DNA replication mechanism were observed. Phylogenetically, these 
ten genomes are in a monophyletic clade with the previously described porcine 
stool-associated virus (PoSCV) but are divergent enough to be further classified 
into to six distinct virus clades.

Using metagenomics and molecular cloning methods, we characterized five novel 
small, circular viral genomes from pig feces that are distantly related to 
chimpanzee and porcine stool-associated circular viruses, (ChiSCV and PoSCV1). 
Phylogenetic analysis placed these viruses into a highly divergent clade of this 
rapidly growing new viral family. This new clade of viruses, provisionally named 
porcine stool-associated circular virus 2 and 3 (PoSCV2 and PoSCV3), encodes a 
stem-loop structure (presumably the origin of DNA replication) in the small 
intergenic region and a replication initiator protein commonly found in other 
biological systems that replicate their genomes via the rolling-circle 
mechanism. Furthermore, these viruses also exhibit three additional overlapping 
open reading frames in the large intergenic region between the capsid and 
replication initiator protein genes.

Orf virus (ORFV), a species of the genus Parapoxvirus of the family Poxviridae, 
causes non-systemic, highly contagious, and eruptive disease in sheep, goat, and 
other wild and domestic ruminants. Our previous work shows orf to be ubiquitous 
in the Fujian Province of China, a region where there is considerable 
heterogeneity among ORFVs. In this study, we sequenced full genomes of four 
Fujian goat ORFV strains (OV-GO, OV-YX, OV-NP, and OV-SJ1). The four strains 
were 132-139 kb in length, with each containing 124-132 genes and about 64% G+C 
content. The most notable differences between the four strains were found near 
the genome termini. OV-NP lacked seven and OV-SJ1 lacked three genes near the 
right terminus when compared against other ORFVs. We also investigated the 
skin-virulence of the four Fujian ORFVs in goats. The ORFVs with gene deletions 
showed low virulence while the ORFVs without gene deletions showed high 
virulence in goats suggesting gene deletion possibly leads to attenuation of 
ORFVs. Gene 134 was disrupted in OV-NP genome due to the lack of initial code. 
The phylogenetic tree based on complete Parapoxviruse genomes showed that sheep 
originated and goat originated ORFVs formed distinctly separate branches with 
100% bootstrap. Based on the single gene phylogenetic tree of 132 genes of 
ORFVs, 47 genes can be easily distinguished as having originated from sheep or 
goats. In order to further reveal genetic variation presented in goat ORFVs and 
sheep ORFVs, we analyzed the deduced amino acid sequences of gene 008, multiple 
alignment of amino acid sequences of gene 008 from the genome of five goat ORFVs 
and four sheep ORFVs revealed 33 unique amino acids differentiating it as having 
sheep or goats as host. The availability of genomic sequences of four Fujian 
goat ORFVs aids in our understanding of the diversity of orf virus isolates in 
this region and can assist in distinguishing between orf strains that originate 
in sheep and goats.

Outbreaks of orf virus on goat farms are common in China. In this study, we 
investigated a severe multifocal cutaneous orf virus outbreak with a correlative 
mixed bacterial infection which persisted for up to 6 months, and which had a 
high morbidity (93.7%) and mortality (15%) among kids in a herd of crossbreed 
goats in Fujian province in China. The disease was diagnosed as an orf virus 
(ORFV XD strain) infection associating with Streptococcus pluranimalium and 
Staphylococcus, identified using standard virological and bacteriological 
techniques. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses of the whole 
ORFV 011 (B2L), 059 (F1L), 032 and 080 genes revealed that the even though the 
virus phylogeny was clustered in branches of conventional orf virus strains, it 
nonetheless evidenced high variation within this subset. Furthermore, the 
sequences from the ORFV 080 gene allowed us to distinguish between the different 
strains at a higher resolution and these observations afforded us a comparative 
view of the ORFV 080 gene. This is the first report describing an outbreak of 
severe multifocal cutaneous orf virus with associated bacterial infection in 
China.

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is the major causative agent of postweaning 
multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and is associated with different syndromes 
affecting pigs. The PCV2 genome has three main open reading frames (ORFs) among 
which the ORF2 encodes the capsid protein. In this study, the ORF2 nucleotide 
sequences of 30 Brazilian isolates were analyzed. The sequences were compared to 
other GenBank sequences using phylogenic and phylogeographic approaches. Our 
results show high sequence variability in Brazil, since, in this work, the 
Brazilian isolates were classified into subgroup 1AB, 2D and 2, which reveals 
that the virus was introduced in Brazil more than once. On the other hand, most 
of Brazilian isolates seem to be derived from only one introduction. According 
to the data from the Pig Breeders' Association, the multiple introductions of 
the virus probably occurred through the import of animals with the asymptomatic 
form of the virus or through the import of contaminated semen. The results point 
to the necessity of implementing programs aimed at selecting sows in order to 
avoid the import of animals infected by Group 1 PCV2.

The high genetic diversity of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 
virus (PRRSV) has been an obstacle to developing an effective vaccine for 
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). This study was performed 
to assess the degree of genetic diversity among PRRSVs from Korean pig farms 
where wasting and respiratory syndrome was observed from 2005 to 2009. Samples 
from 786 farms were tested for the presence of PRRSV using reverse transcription 
PCR protocol. A total of 117 farms were positive for type 1 PRRSV while 198 
farms were positive for type 2. Nucleotide sequences encoding the open reading 
frame (ORF) 5 were analyzed and compared to those of various published PRRSV 
isolates obtained worldwide. Sequence identity of the ORF 5 in the isolates was 
81.6˜100% for type 1 viruses and 81.4˜100% for type 2 viruses. Phylogenetic 
analysis of the ORF 5 sequences showed that types 1 and 2 PRRSVs from Korea were 
mainly classified into three and four clusters, respectively. The analyzed 
isolates were distributed throughout the clusters independent of the isolation 
year or geographical origin. In conclusion, our results indicated that the 
genetic diversity of PRRSVs from Korean pig farms is high and has been 
increasing over time.

A Newcastle disease surveillance program was conducted at live bird markets in 
Korea to expand our epidemiologic understanding of the disease in Korea. During 
the surveillance program, 10 lentogenic Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) were 
isolated and identified from apparently healthy chickens and ducks at live bird 
markets. The lentogenic viruses had sequence motifs of either 112GKQGRL117 (n = 
8) or 112GRQGRL117 (n = 2) at the F0 cleavage site. Sequencing and phylogenetic 
analyses of NDV isolates based on the hypervariable region of the F protein 
revealed two different genotypes: genotypes I (n = 8) and II (n = 2). Genotype I 
viruses were most closely related to the NDV V4 strain (n = 7) or the NDV Ulster 
2C strain (n = 1). In contrast, genotype II viruses clustered with the NDV 
vaccine strains (LaSota and VG/GA) that are commonly used as live vaccines in 
Korea. The epidemiologic importance of NDV at live bird markets in Korea is 
discussed.

Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an important worldwide disease in the 
livestock industry. To date, little research has been done on BVDV circulating 
in the Republic of Korea (ROK). The cases outlined in our research originated 
from rectal swabs taken from calves up to 80 days of age. Twenty-two of 99 
Korean indigenous calves with diarrhea were identified as BVDV positive and 3 
different 5'-untranslated region (UTR) sequences were determined. The results 
indicated that BVDV infections in the ROK were found mostly in winter and when 
calves were less than 20 days old. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 5'-UTR 
revealed that our cases from Korean indigenous calves belonged to BVDV-2a. 
Therefore, the result of this study will be useful to understand epidemiology 
and allow producers in the ROK to better protect their livestock.

We surveyed live-poultry markets in Korea in 2003 and isolated 9 H9N2, 6 H3N2, 
and 1 H6N1 influenza viruses. Antigenic and phylogenetic analyses showed that 
all 9 H9N2 isolates were of A/Chicken/Korea/25232-96006/96-like lineage (which 
caused disease in chickens in Korea in 1996) but were different from H9N2 
viruses of southeastern China. They had at least 4 genotypes and replicated in 
chickens but not in mice. The H3N2 and H6N1 viruses were new to Korea and were 
probably reassortants of avian influenza viruses from southeastern China and 
recent Korean H9N2 viruses. All 8 segments of the H3N2 viruses formed a single 
phylogenetic cluster with 99.1 to 100% homology. The H3N2 viruses replicated in 
chickens and mice without preadaptation, but the H6N1 virus did not. Our results 
show an increasingly diverse pool of avian influenza viruses in Korea that are 
potential pandemic influenza agents.

Background: Ticks are primary vectors for many well-known disease-causing agents 
that affect human and animal populations globally such as tick-borne 
encephalitis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and African swine fever. In this 
study, viral metagenomics was used to identify what viruses are present in 
Rhipicephalus spp. ticks collected in the Zambezi Valley of Mozambique. Methods: 
The RNA was amplified with sequence-independent single primer amplification 
(SISPA) and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent 
platform. The generated sequences were subjected to quality check and classfied 
by BLAST. CodonCode aligner and SeqMan were used to assemble the sequences. 
Results: The majority of viral sequences showed closest sequence identity to the 
Orthomyxoviridae family, although viruses similar to the Parvoviridae and 
Coronaviridae were also identified. Nearly complete sequences of five 
orthomyxoviral segments (HA, NP, PB1, PB2, and PA) were obtained and these 
showed an amino acid identity of 32-52% to known quaranjaviruses. The sequences 
were most closely related to the Wellfleet Bay virus, detected and isolated from 
common eider during a mortality event in the USA. Conclusions: In summary, this 
study has identified a highly divergent virus with in the Orthomyxoviridae 
family associated with Rhipicephalus ticks from Mozambique. Further genetic and 
biological studies are needed in order to investigate potential pathogenesis of 
the identified orthomyxovirus.

Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens inoculated with low passage Chicken 
anaemia virus (CAV), SMSC-1 and 3-1 isolates produced lesions suggestive of CAV 
infection. Repeated passages of the isolates in cell culture until passage 60 
(P60) and passage 123 produced viruses that showed a significantly reduced level 
of pathogenicity in SPF chickens compared to the low passage isolates. Sequence 
comparison indicated that nucleotide changes in only the coding region of the 
P60 passage isolates were thought to contribute to virus attenuation. 
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that SMSC-1 and 3-1 were highly divergent, but 
their P60 passage derivatives shared significant homology to a Japanese isolate 
A2.

BACKGROUND: Sequence-independent amplification of clinical specimens can lead to 
the identification of novel pathogens.
OBJECTIVES: To identify novel viruses in human stool specimens from patients 
with diarrhea and to investigate the ecology and clinical significance of such 
viruses.
STUDY DESIGN: Nucleic acid extracted from stool specimens from patients with 
diarrhea with no known etiology were subjected to random PCR amplification and 
Roche/454 pyrosequencing. Novel viruses identified were genetically and 
epidemiologically characterized.
RESULTS: Four gyroviruses, chicken anemia virus (CAV), human gyrovirus 
(HGV)/avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2), gyrovirus 3 (GyV3) and a novel gyrovirus 
(tentatively designated as gyrovirus 4 (GyV4)) were identified in human stool 
specimens. GyV4, as well as CAV and AGV2/HGV were also detected in chicken skin 
and meat used for human consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel gyrovirus (GyV4) was identified in human stool and in 
chicken meat sold for human consumption. This virus was phylogenetically 
distinct from previously reported gyroviruses in chicken and humans (chicken 
anemia virus, human gyrovirus, avian gyrovirus 2 and recently reported gyrovirus 
3). The epidemiology and pathogenesis of this virus in humans and in chicken 
needs to be further investigated.

Infections of poultry with virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1), 
also known as Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs), cause Newcastle disease (ND). 
This highly contagious disease affects poultry and many other species of birds 
worldwide. In countries where the disease is prevalent, constant monitoring and 
characterization of isolates causing outbreaks are necessary. In this study, we 
report the results of pathogenicity testing and phylogenetic analyses of seven 
NDVs isolated from several regions of Peru between 2004 and 2015. Six viruses 
had intracerebral pathogenicity indices (ICPIs) of between 1.75 and 1.88, 
corresponding to a velogenic pathotype. The remaining virus had an ICPI of 0.00, 
corresponding to a lentogenic pathotype. These results were consistent with 
amino acid sequences at the fusion protein (F) cleavage site. All velogenic 
isolates had the polybasic amino acid sequence 112RRQKR↓F117 at the F cleavage 
site. Phylogenetic analyses of complete F gene sequences showed that all 
isolates are classified in class II of APMV-1. The velogenic viruses are 
classified in genotype XII, while the lentogenic virus is classified in genotype 
II, closely related to the LaSota vaccine strain. Moreover, tree topology, 
bootstrap values, and genetic distances observed within genotype XII resulted in 
the identification of novel subgenotypes XIIa (in South America) and XIIb (in 
China) and possibly two clades within genotype XIIa. All velogenic Peruvian 
viruses belonged to subgenotype XIIa. Overall, our results confirm the presence 
of genotype XII in Peru and suggest that it is the prevalent genotype currently 
circulating in our country. The phylogenetic characterization of these isolates 
helps to characterize the evolution of NDV and may help with the development of 
vaccines specific to our regional necessities.

Swine have been known to be a suitable host for influenza A virus. In Thailand, 
phylogenetic analysis on swine influenza virus (SIV) has as yet not been 
attempted. The present report presents molecular and phylogenetic analysis 
performed on SIV in Thailand. In this study, 12 SIV isolates from the central 
and eastern part of Thailand were subtyped and the molecular genetics of 
hemagglutinin and neuraminidase were elucidated. Three subtypes, H1N1, H1N2 and 
H3N2, are described. Phylogenetic analysis of the SIV hemagglutinin and 
neuraminidase genes shows individual clusters with swine, human or avian 
influenza virus at various global locations. Furthermore, amino acid 
substitutions were detected either at the receptor binding site or the antigenic 
sites of the hemagglutinin gene.

A novel bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) genotype comprising 5394 nt was identified by 
next generation sequencing from sera of healthy cattle at different age groups 
farmed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The genome organization of new 
BPV2 genotype retains the two ORFs typical of members of the Parvovirinae with 
86.4 % of overall nucleotide sequence identities in comparison to other members 
of the subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis revealed similar clustering with two 
previously described bovine BPV2 within the genus Copiparvovirus. No significant 
differences (P ≥ 0.05) were detected in the distribution of BPV2 infection in 
cattle at different age groups. This is the third complete or near complete 
genome sequence of BPV2 reported to date and may contribute to a better 
understanding of the biology of copiparvoviruses and its interactions with the 
host.

The genus Pestivirus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family, includes ssRNA+ 
viruses responsible for infectious diseases in pigs, cattle, sheep, goats and 
other domestic and wild ruminants. Like most of the RNA viruses, pestivirus has 
high genome variability with practical consequences on disease epidemiology, 
diagnosis and control. In addition to the officially recognized species in the 
genus Pestivirus, such as BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BDV and CSFV, other pestiviruses have 
been detected. Furthermore, most of the ruminant pestiviruses show low or absent 
species specificity observed in serological tests and are able to infect 
multiple species. Particularly, small ruminants are receptive hosts of the most 
heterogeneous group of pestiviruses. The aim of this study was to carry out the 
molecular characterization of pestiviruses isolated from sheep and goats in 
Sicily, Italy. Phylogenetic analysis of two viral genomic regions (a fragment of 
5'-UTR and the whole Npro regions) revealed the presence of different pestivirus 
genotypes in the analysed goat and sheep herds. Two of five viral isolates were 
clustered with BVDV-1d viruses, a strain widespread in Italy, but never reported 
in Sicily. The other three isolates formed a distinct cluster with high 
similarity to Tunisian isolates, recently proposed as a new pestivirus species. 
This represents the first evidence for Tunisian-like pestivirus presence in 
small ruminants in Italy. Furthermore, one of the isolates was collected from a 
goat, representing the first isolation of Tunisian-like pestivirus from this 
species.

Rotaviruses (RV) are the leading cause of gastroenteritis in infants and 
children worldwide and are associated with high mortality predominately in 
low-income settings. The virus is classified into G and P serotypes and further 
into P genotypes based on differences in the surface-exposed proteins VP7 and 
VP4, respectively. Infection results in a variable level of protection from 
subsequent reinfection and disease. This protection is predominantly homotypic 
in some settings, whereas broader heterotypic protection is reported in other 
cohorts. Two antigenically distinct oral RV vaccines are licensed and are being 
rolled out widely, including in resource-poor setting, with funding provided by 
the GAVI alliance. First is a monovalent vaccine derived from a live-attenuated 
human RV strain, whereas the second is a pentavalent bovine-human reassortment 
vaccine. Both vaccines are highly efficacious in high-income settings, but 
greatly reduced levels of protection are reported in low-income countries. Here, 
the current challenges facing mucosal immunologists and vaccinologists aiming to 
define immunological correlates and to understand the variable levels of 
protection conferred by these vaccines in humans is considered. Such 
understanding is critical to maximize the public health impact of the current 
vaccines and also to the development of the next generation of RV vaccines, 
which are needed.

Structural analysis of electrophoretic variation in the genome profiles of rotavirus field isolates,"<jats:p>Detailed structural studies were undertaken on five isolates of bovine rotavirus which showed variability in the migration patterns of their genome segments on electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. The individual genome segments of each isolate were characterized by partial digestion of terminally radiolabeled RNA with a base-specific nuclease. This analysis showed that whereas mobility variations were always associated with detectable changes in nucleotide sequence, sequence changes at least as great as those found in segments showing electrophoretic mobility variations were also detected in segments showing no mobility variation. Evidence for the occurrence of genome segment reassortment between viruses in the field was obtained from analyzing the species 11 RNAs from these five isolates. The overall conclusion from these results is that great care is required in the interpretation of simple genome profile analysis of different isolates for epidemiological purposes and that classification of these viruses solely on the basis of genome electropherotype could be misleading.</jats:p>",0
Identification and Analysis of the First 2009 Pandemic H1N1 Influenza Virus from U.S. Feral Swine,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The first case of pandemic H1N1 influenza (pH1N1) virus in feral swine in the United States was identified in Texas through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services’ surveillance program. Two samples were identified as pandemic influenza by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT‐qPCR). Full‐genome Sanger sequencing of all eight influenza segments was performed. In addition, Illumina deep sequencing of the original diagnostic samples and their respective virus isolation cultures were performed to assess the feasibility of using an unbiased whole‐genome linear target amplification method and multiple sample sequencing in a single Illumina GAIIx lane. Identical sequences were obtained using both techniques. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all gene segments belonged to the pH1N1 (2009) lineage. In conclusion, we have identified the first pH1N1 isolate in feral swine in the United States and have demonstrated the use of an easy unbiased linear amplification method for deep sequencing of multiple samples.</jats:p>",0

            strains by the resistance of their hemagglutinins to trypsin treatment and their inability to recover hemagglutinating capacity after removal of dithiothreitol from treated virus preparations. In these respects, the equine strain most closely resembled the Hong Kong variants. The pattern of hemagglutination inactivation also set the swine, PR8, and CAME strains apart from each other as well as from the other five strains. The results suggest that separation of type A viruses into groups by the pattern of inactivation of their hemagglutinins may be a valuable adjunct to standard serology for a more definite classification of these viruses.

Human enteroviruses (EV) pose a major risk to public health. This is especially 
so in the Asia-Pacific region where increasing numbers of hand, foot and mouth 
disease (HFMD) cases and large outbreaks of severe neurological disease 
associated with EV-A71 have occurred. Despite their importance, key aspects of 
the emergence, epidemiology and evolution of EVs remain unclear, and most 
studies of EV evolution have focused on a limited number of genes. Here, we 
describe the genomic-scale evolution of EV-A viruses sampled from pediatric 
patients with mild disease attending a single hospital in western Sydney, 
Australia, over an 18-month period. This analysis revealed the presence of eight 
viral serotypes-Coxsackievirus (CV) A2, A4, A5, A6, A8, A10, A16 and EV-A71-with 
up to four different serotypes circulating in any 1 month. Despite an absence of 
large-scale outbreaks, high levels of geographical and temporal mixing of 
serotypes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that multiple strains 
of the same serotype were present in the community, and that this diversity was 
shaped by multiple introductions into the Sydney population, with only a single 
lineage of CV-A6 exhibiting in situ transmission over the entire study period. 
Genomic-scale analyses also revealed the presence of novel and historical EV 
recombinants. Notably, our analysis revealed no association between viral 
phylogeny, including serotype, and patient age, sex, nor disease severity (for 
uncomplicated disease). This study emphasizes the contribution of EV-A viruses 
other than EV-A71 to mild EV disease including HFMD in Australia and highlights 
the need for greater surveillance of these viruses to improve strategies for 
outbreak preparedness and vaccine design.

Viral metagenomics characterizes known and identifies unknown viruses based on 
sequence similarities to any previously sequenced viral genomes. A metagenomics 
approach was used to identify virus sequences in Australian mosquitoes causing 
cytopathic effects in inoculated mammalian cell cultures. Sequence comparisons 
revealed strains of Liao Ning virus (Reovirus, Seadornavirus), previously 
detected only in China, livestock-infecting Stretch Lagoon virus (Reovirus, 
Orbivirus), two novel dimarhabdoviruses, named Beaumont and North Creek viruses, 
and two novel orthobunyaviruses, named Murrumbidgee and Salt Ash viruses. The 
novel virus proteomes diverged by ≥ 50% relative to their closest previously 
genetically characterized viral relatives. Deep sequencing also generated 
genomes of Warrego and Wallal viruses, orbiviruses linked to kangaroo blindness, 
whose genomes had not been fully characterized. This study highlights viral 
metagenomics in concert with traditional arbovirus surveillance to characterize 
known and new arboviruses in field-collected mosquitoes. Follow-up 
epidemiological studies are required to determine whether the novel viruses 
infect humans.

Arthropod-borne flaviviruses such as yellow fever (YFV), Zika and dengue viruses 
continue to cause significant human disease globally. These viruses are 
transmitted by mosquitoes when a female imbibes an infected blood-meal from a 
viremic vertebrate host and expectorates the virus into a subsequent host. 
Bamaga virus (BgV) is a flavivirus recently discovered in Culex sitiens subgroup 
mosquitoes collected from Cape York Peninsula, Australia. This virus 
phylogenetically clusters with the YFV group, but is potentially restricted in 
most vertebrates. However, high levels of replication in an opossum cell line 
(OK) indicate a potential association with marsupials. To ascertain whether BgV 
could be horizontally transmitted by mosquitoes, the vector competence of two 
members of the Cx. sitiens subgroup, Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sitiens, for BgV 
was investigated. Eleven to thirteen days after imbibing an infectious 
blood-meal, infection rates were 11.3% and 18.8% for Cx. annulirostris and Cx. 
sitiens, respectively. Cx. annulirostris transmitted the virus at low levels 
(5.6% had BgV-positive saliva overall); Cx. sitiens did not transmit the virus. 
When mosquitoes were injected intrathoracially with BgV, the infection and 
transmission rates were 100% and 82%, respectively, for both species. These 
results provided evidence for the first time that BgV can be transmitted 
horizontally by Cx. annulirostris, the primary vector of pathogenic zoonotic 
flaviviruses in Australia. We also assessed whether BgV could interfere with 
replication in vitro, and infection and transmission in vivo of super-infecting 
pathogenic Culex-associated flaviviruses. BgV significantly reduced growth of 
Murray Valley encephalitis and West Nile (WNV) viruses in vitro. While prior 
infection with BgV by injection did not inhibit WNV super-infection of Cx. 
annulirostris, significantly fewer BgV-infected mosquitoes could transmit WNV 
than mock-injected mosquitoes. Overall, these data contribute to our 
understanding of flavivirus ecology, modes of transmission by Australian 
mosquitoes and mechanisms for super-infection interference.

Despite studies of viromes isolated from aquatic environments are becoming 
increasingly frequent, most of them are limited to the characterization of viral 
taxonomy. Bacterial reads in viromes are abundant but the extent to which this 
genetic material is playing a role in the ecology of aquatic microbiology 
remains unclear. To this aim, we developed of a useful approach for the 
characterization of viral and microbial communities of aquatic environments with 
a particular focus on the identification of microbial genes harbored in the 
viromes. Virus-like particles were isolated from water samples collected across 
the Lambro River, from the spring to the high urbanized Milan area. The derived 
viromes were analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing looking for the 
presence, relative abundance of bacterial genes with particular focus on those 
genes involved in antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Antibiotic and heavy 
metal resistance genes have been identified in all virome samples together with 
a high abundance of reads assigned to cellular processes and signaling. Virome 
data compared to those identified in the microbiome isolated from the same 
sample revealed differences in terms of functional categories and their relative 
abundance. To verify the role of aquatic viral population in bacterial gene 
transfer, water-based mesocosms were perturbed or not perturbed with a low dose 
of tetracycline. The results obtained by qPCR assays revealed variation in 
abundance of tet genes in the virome and microbiome highlighting a relevant role 
of viral populations in microbial gene mobilization.

Beyond the gut bacterial microbiota: The gut virome,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>The gastrointestinal tract is colonized with a highly different population of bacterial, viral, ad fungal species; viruses are reported to be dominant. The composition of gut virome is closely related to dietary habits and surrounding environment. Host and their intestinal microbes live in a dynamic equilibrium and viruses stimulate a low degree of immune responses without causing symptoms (host tolerance). However, intestinal phages could lead to a rupture of eubiosis and may contribute to the shift from health to disease in humans and animals. Viral nucleic acids and other products of lysis of bacteria serve as pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and could trigger specific inflammatory modulations. At the same time, phages could elicit innate antiviral immune responses. Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) operated as innate antiviral immune sensors and their activation triggers signaling cascades that lead to inflammatory response. <jats:bold><jats:italic>J. Med.

Modular approach to customise sample preparation procedures for viral metagenomics: a reproducible protocol for virome analysis,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A major limitation for better understanding the role of the human gut virome in health and disease is the lack of validated methods that allow high throughput virome analysis. To overcome this, we evaluated the quantitative effect of homogenisation, centrifugation, filtration, chloroform treatment and random amplification on a mock-virome (containing nine highly diverse viruses) and a bacterial mock-community (containing four faecal bacterial species) using quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing. This resulted in an optimised protocol that was able to recover all viruses present in the mock-virome and strongly alters the ratio of viral versus bacterial and 16S rRNA genetic material in favour of viruses (from 43.2% to 96.7% viral reads and from 47.6% to 0.19% bacterial reads). Furthermore, our study indicated that most of the currently used virome protocols, using small filter pores and/or stringent centrifugation conditions may have largely overlooked large viruses present in viromes.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotypic range 
of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) in the pig population of northern Lao People's 
Democratic Republic (PDR). We collected 181 faecal samples from indigenous-breed 
pigs ≤ 6 months of age and the faeces was stored in RNA stabilisation buffer due 
to cold-chain and transport limitations. Twenty-one (11.6%) pigs had detectable 
HEV RNA and 43.5% of village pig herds were infected. Based on a 240 base 
pair-nucleotide sequence flanking the junction of open reading frames 1, 2 and 3 
(ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3) the isolates were phylogenetically classified within 
genotype 4. Phylogenetic analyses revealed distinct genetic groupings of the Lao 
HEV isolates and two groups clustered with human and pig HEV isolates from 
China. This was the first study to demonstrate genotype 4 HEV in Lao PDR and 
indicates pigs are a potential reservoir for human HEV infection.

Highly Divergent Hepaciviruses from African Cattle,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>

            The hepatitis C virus (HCV; genus
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepacivirus</jats:named-content>
            ) is a highly relevant human pathogen. Unique hepaciviruses (HV) were discovered recently in animal hosts. The direct ancestor of HCV has not been found, but the genetically most closely related animal HVs exist in horses. To investigate whether other peridomestic animals also carry HVs, we analyzed sera from Ghanaian cattle for HVs by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Nine of 106 specimens from different sampling sites contained HV RNA (8.5%) at median viral loads of 1.6 × 10
            <jats:sup>5</jats:sup>
            copies/ml. Infection seemed unrelated to cattle age and gender. Near-full-genome sequencing of five representative viruses confirmed taxonomic classifications. Cattle HVs formed two distinct phylogenetic lineages that differed by up to 17.7% on the nucleotide level in the polyprotein-encoding region, suggesting cocirculation of different virus subtypes. A conserved microRNA122-binding site in the 5′ internal ribosomal entry site suggested liver tropism of cattle HVs. Phylogenetic analyses suggested the circulation of HVs in cattle for several centuries. Cattle HVs were genetically highly divergent from all other HVs, including HCV. HVs from genetically related equine and bovine hosts were not monophyletic, corroborating host shifts during the evolution of the genus
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepacivirus</jats:named-content>
            . Similar to equine HVs, the genetic diversity of cattle HVs was low compared to that of HCV genotypes. This suggests an influence of the human-modified ecology of peridomestic animals on virus diversity. Further studies should investigate the occurrence of cattle HVs in other geographic areas and breeds, virus pathogenicity in cattle, and the potential exposure of human risk groups, such as farmers, butchers, and abattoir workers.

Unique hepaciviruses (HVs) were discovered over the last few years in animals, but the direct ancestor of HCV has not been found. The animal HV most closely related to HCV so far originated from horses, suggesting that other livestock animals also harbor HVs. Therefore, we investigated African cattle and discovered previously unknown HVs at high prevalence and viral loads. Because of the agricultural importance of cattle, it may be relevant to investigate HV pathogenicity. The frequent exposure of humans to cattle also may warrant investigations of the zoonotic potential of these viruses. Evolutionary analyses suggested that cattle HVs have existed for centuries. Despite the genetic relatedness of their animal hosts, HVs from cattle and horses were not phylogenetically related, corroborating frequent host shifts during the evolution of the genus

The target of neutralizing antibodies that protect against influenza virus 
infection is the viral protein HA. Genetic and antigenic variation in HA has 
been used to classify influenza viruses into subtypes (H1-H16). The neutralizing 
antibody response to influenza virus is thought to be specific for a few 
antigenically related isolates within a given subtype. However, while 
heterosubtypic antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple influenza virus 
subtypes have been recently isolated from phage display libraries, it is not 
known whether such antibodies are produced in the course of an immune response 
to influenza virus infection or vaccine. Here we report that, following 
vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine containing H1 and H3 influenza virus 
subtypes, some individuals produce antibodies that cross-react with H5 HA. By 
immortalizing IgG-expressing B cells from 4 individuals, we isolated 20 
heterosubtypic mAbs that bound and neutralized viruses belonging to several HA 
subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9), including the pandemic A/California/07/09 
H1N1 isolate. The mAbs used different VH genes and carried a high frequency of 
somatic mutations. With the exception of a mAb that bound to the HA globular 
head, all heterosubtypic mAbs bound to acid-sensitive epitopes in the HA stem 
region. Four mAbs were evaluated in vivo and protected mice from challenge with 
influenza viruses representative of different subtypes. These findings reveal 
that seasonal influenza vaccination can induce polyclonal heterosubtypic 
neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 
influenza virus and with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.

Different isolates of peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV) from outbreaks in 
Africa and India were investigated for virulence in West African dwarf goats in 
the Ivory Coast. Six groups of five animals received a virulent suspension of 
various strains of virus at a concentration of 10(3) TCID(50)/mL and the goats 
were observed for 15 days after infection. The Côte-d'Ivoire 89 (CI89), Guinea 
Conakry and Bissau Guinea PPRV strains caused a peracute disease; the 
India-Calcutta strain caused acute disease; the Sudan-Sennar strain produced an 
acute to mild disease, while the Nigeria 75/1 wild-type strain caused a mild 
disease and the animals recovered. The viruses studied contained examples of 
PPRV from specific lineage groups based on their nucleoprotein PPRV gene. This 
experiment indicated that virulence characteristics might be a useful marker to 
help classify PPRV isolates.

This report describes the genetic and antigenic variability of bovine viral 
diarrhea virus strains isolated in Belgium. Part of the 5' untranslated region 
and the 5' end of the gp53 (E2) coding sequence were amplified by PCR and 
sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most field isolates segregated into 
genotypes Ib or II. Only one out of 28 field isolates belonged to genotype Ia. 
Interestingly, some type I strains were equally divergent from types Ia and Ib 
strains and clustered into additional subtypes within genotype I. Immune sera 
from young calves experimentally inoculated with field isolates first identified 
on the basis of their sequences were used in two-way neutralisation experiments. 
The results clearly differentiated type I from type II strains although some 
degree of cross-neutralisation was observed. Within type I, the new clusters 
could not be antigenically differentiated from the more prevalent type Ib 
strains or from type Ia strain NADL, suggesting that BVDV genotype I is 
antigenically homogeneous. The isolation of BVDV types I and II strains from 
cell lines and from a bovine vaccine suggest that molecular epidemiology 
surveillance is warranted for BVDV.

Animal genomics in natural reservoirs of infectious diseases.

Cowled C, Wang LF.

Natural virus reservoirs such as wild bats, birds, rodents and non-human 
primates are generally non-model organisms that have, until recently, presented 
limited opportunities for in-depth study. Next-generation sequencing provides a 
way to partially circumvent this limitation, since the methods required for data 
acquisition and analysis are largely species-independent. Comparative genomics 
and other 'omics' provide new opportunities to study the structure and function 
of various biological systems of wild species that are otherwise out of reach. 
Genomes of natural reservoir hosts can help to identify dominant pathways of 
virus-host interaction and to reveal differences between susceptible and 
resistant organisms, populations and species. This is of great scientific 
interest and may also provide a resource for the rational design of treatments 
for viral diseases in humans and livestock. In this way, we will 'learn from 
nature' and one day apply this knowledge to create disease-resistant livestock 
or develop novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. Reservoir host genomics 
will also open up possibilities for developing novel vaccines for wildlife, aid 
in the development of new diagnostic platforms, and have broad implications for 
developmental and evolutionary biology. In this review, the authors focus on 
natural reservoir hosts of viral pathogens, although most of the discussion 
points should be equally applicable to natural reservoirs of pathogenic 
bacteria, fungi or other parasites.

Publisher: En général, les réservoirs naturels sauvages des virus, qu’il 
s’agisse de chauves-souris, d’oiseaux, de rongeurs ou de primates non humains ne 
font pas partie des espèces modèles utilisées pour l’expérimentation et jusqu’à 
une époque récente il était particulièrement difficile de mener des recherches 
approfondies sur ces animaux, difficiles d’accès. Le séquençage de nouvelle 
génération permet de contourner partiellement cette limitation, puisque les 
méthodes nécessaires pour obtenir et analyser les données de séquences sont en 
grande partie indépendantes de l’espèce étudiée. La génomique comparée, au même 
titre que d’autres technologies dites « omiques » offre de nouvelles 
possibilités d’étudier la structure et les fonctions de systèmes biologiques 
appartenant à une variété d’espèces sauvages auxquelles les chercheurs n’ont 
aucun accès. L’étude du génome des hôtes réservoirs naturels permet d’identifier 
les voies privilégiées d’interaction entre le virus et l’organisme hôte et 
d’élucider ce qui distingue les espèces, les populations et les organismes 
sensibles de ceux qui sont résistants. Cet aspect présente un grand intérêt 
scientifique et pourrait générer les données nécessaires à la conception de 
traitements rationnels contre les maladies virales humaines ou animales. C’est 
ainsi que nous « apprendrons de la nature » et pourrons un jour utiliser ces 
connaissances pour donner naissance à des animaux d’élevage résistants aux 
maladies ou pour mettre au point des stratégies thérapeutiques et 
prophylactiques innovantes. D’autres perspectives prometteuses de la génomique 
des hôtes réservoirs portent sur la mise au point de vaccins innovants destinés 
à la faune sauvage et sur le développement de nouvelles plateformes 
diagnostiques. La génomique aura également un impact important en biologie du 
développement et de l’évolution. La synthèse présentée par les auteurs est axée 
sur les hôtes réservoirs naturels des virus, mais la plupart des points examinés 
s’appliquent tout aussi bien aux réservoirs naturels d’autres agents pathogènes 
tels que les bactéries, les champignons ou les parasites.

Publisher: En general los animales salvajes que sirven de reservorios naturales 
de virus, tales como murciélagos, aves, roedores o primates no humanos, no 
constituyen «organismos modelo» para la ciencia, por lo que hasta hace poco 
ofrecían escasas oportunidades de estudio detallado. La secuenciación de próxima 
generación proporciona un medio para salvar parcialmente este obstáculo, por 
cuanto los métodos requeridos para obtener y analizar datos son, en gran medida, 
independientes de la especie de que se trate. La genómica comparada y otras 
técnicas «ómicas» abren nuevas posibilidades para estudiar la estructura y 
función de varios sistemas biológicos de especies salvajes que de otro modo 
quedarían fuera de nuestro alcance. El genoma de especies que constituyen 
reservorios naturales puede ser útil para determinar las vías predominantes de 
interacción virus–anfitrión y revelar diferencias entre los organismos (o 
poblaciones o especies) sensibles y los resistentes. Ello, además del gran 
interés científico que reviste, puede suponer un recurso para la concepción 
racional de terapias contra enfermedades víricas del hombre y el ganado. De esta 
manera «aprenderemos de la naturaleza» y algún día emplearemos este saber para 
generar ganado resistente a determinadas enfermedades o poner a punto nuevos 
métodos de tratamiento o prevención. La genómica de los reservorios también 
abrirá vías para obtener nuevas vacunas destinadas a los animales salvajes, 
ayudará a crear nuevos dispositivos de diagnóstico y tendrá repercusiones de 
gran calado para la biología evolutiva y del desarrollo. Los autores se centran 
aquí en los reservorios de patógenos víricos, aunque la mayoría de los aspectos 
examinados deberían poder aplicarse igualmente a los reservorios naturales de 
patógenos bacterianos y fúngicos u otros parásitos.

Pseudorabies virus infection in Oklahoma hunting dogs,"<jats:p> Pseudorabies is caused by Suid herpesvirus 1, a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. Although pigs are the natural host of Pseudorabies virus (PRV), the virus has a broad host range and may cause fatal encephalitis in many species. The United States obtained PRV-free status in 2004 after the virus was eradicated from domestic swineherds, but the virus is still present in feral swine populations. The current report describes PRV infection in 3 dogs that were used to hunt feral swine. The dogs developed clinical signs including facial pruritus with facial abrasions, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, ataxia, muscle stiffness, and death. Two were euthanized, and 1 died within approximately 48 hr after onset of clinical signs. The salient histologic changes consisted of neutrophilic trigeminal ganglioneuritis with neuronophagia and equivocal intranuclear inclusion bodies. Pseudorabies virus was isolated from fresh tissues from 2 of the dogs, and immunohistochemistry detected the virus in the third dog. Virus sequencing and phylogeny, based upon available GenBank sequences, revealed that the virus was likely a field strain that was closely related to a cluster of PRV strains previously identified in Illinois. Though eradicated from domestic swine in the United States, PRV is present in populations of feral swine, and should therefore continue to be considered a possible cause of disease in dogs and other domestic animals with compatible clinical history and signs. Continued surveillance is necessary to prevent reintroduction of PRV into domestic swine. </jats:p>",0

Mutation and reassortment of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses 
at the animal-human interface remain a major concern for emergence of viruses 
with pandemic potential. To understand the relationship of H5N1 viruses 
circulating in poultry and those isolated from humans, comprehensive 
phylogenetic and molecular analyses of viruses collected from both hosts in 
Vietnam between 2003 and 2010 were performed. We examined the temporal and 
spatial distribution of human cases relative to H5N1 poultry outbreaks and 
characterized the genetic lineages and amino acid substitutions in each gene 
segment identified in humans relative to closely related viruses from avian 
hosts. Six hemagglutinin clades and 8 genotypes were identified in humans, all 
of which were initially identified in poultry. Several amino acid mutations 
throughout the genomes of viruses isolated from humans were identified, 
indicating the potential for poultry viruses infecting humans to rapidly acquire 
molecular markers associated with mammalian adaptation and antiviral resistance.

Phylogenetic analyses of 169 influenza A(H5N1) virus genomes were conducted for 
samples collected through active surveillance and outbreak responses in Vietnam 
between September 2010 and September 2012. While clade 1.1 viruses persisted in 
southern regions, three genetically distinct subgroups of clade 2.3.2.1 were 
found in northern and central Vietnam. The identification of each subgroup 
corresponded with detection of novel reassortants, likely due to their 
overlapping circulation throughout the country. While the previously identified 
clade 1.1 and A/Hubei/1/2010-like 2.3.2.1 genotypes remained the predominant 
viruses detected, four viruses were found to be reassortants between 
A/Hubei/1/2010-like (HA, NA, PB2, PB1, PA, NP) and 
A/duck/Vietnam/NCVD-885/2010-like (M, NS) viruses and one virus was identified 
as having A/duck/Vietnam/NCVD-885/2010-like HA, NA, PB1, and NP with 
A/Hubei/1/2010-like PB2 and PA genes. Additionally, clade 2.3.2.1 A/Hong 
Kong/6841/2010-like viruses, first detected in mid-2012, were identified as 
reassortants comprised of A/Hubei/1/2010-like PB2 and PA and 
A/duck/Vietnam/NCVD-885/2010-like PB1, NP, NA, M, NS genes.

Two Loci Controlling Genetic Cellular Resistance to Avian Leukosis-Sarcoma Viruses,"<jats:p>Female chickens known to be heterozygous for resistance to subgroups A and B of the avian leukosis-sarcoma viruses were mated to males known to be homozygously resistant to both. The progeny were assayed both on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in tissue culture for resistance to representative viruses of the A, B, and tentatively defined C subgroups. Segregation ratios of resistance to A and B subgroup viruses agreed with the previously suggested hypothesis of single-autosomal-recessive genes controlling resistance to each subgroup. Mixed infection on the CAM and replicate plate infection in tissue culture with subgroup A and B viruses showed that resistance to the A and B subgroups was inherited independently. Assays with viruses tentatively classified as subgroup C indicated that they were largely composed of a mixture of subgroup A and B viruses or of particles possessing the host range specificity of both. However, virus stocks of the subgroup C category, as well as some stocks classified as subgroup B, produced small numbers of pocks or foci on individuals known to be resistant to subgroup A and B viruses. It is suggested that these Rous sarcoma virus stocks carry between 1 and 10% of a true subgroup C virus.</jats:p>",0
Phylogenetic analysis and pathogenicity of H3 subtype avian influenza viruses isolated from live poultry markets in China,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>H3 subtype influenza A virus is one of the main subtypes that threats both public and animal health. However, the evolution and pathogenicity of H3 avian influenza virus (AIV) circulating in domestic birds in China remain largely unclear. In this study, seven H3 AIVs (four H3N2 and three H3N8) were isolated from poultry in live poultry market (LPM) in China. Phylogenetic analyses of full genomes showed that all viruses were clustered into Eurasian lineage, except N8 genes of two H3N8 isolates fell into North American lineage. Intriguingly, the N8 gene of one H3N8 and PB2, PB1, NP and NS of two H3N2 isolates have close relationship with those of the highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses circulating in Korea and United States, suggesting that the H3-like AIV may contribute internal genes to the highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses. Phylogenetic tree of HA gene and antigenic cross-reactivity results indicated that two antigenically different H3 viruses are circulating in LPM in China. Most of the H3 viruses replicated in mice lung and nasal turbinate without prior adaptation and the representative H3 viruses infected chickens without causing clinical signs. The reassortment of H3 subtype influenza viruses warrants continuous surveillance in LPM in China.</jats:p>",0

We analyzed five H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated from different 
birds in 2012 in China. Based on whole-genome sequences, we divided the viruses 
into four genotypes. The DKE26, GSE43, and DKE53 viruses belonged to Genotypes 
1-3, respectively. The CKE93 and CKE96 viruses were classified into Genotype 4. 
Genotypes 1-3 correspond to the viruses containing the HA gene of clade 2.3.2, 
and Genotype 4 is the virus that bears the HA gene of clade 7.2. To better 
understand the pathogenicity and transmission of the viruses, we infected 
chickens with 103 EID50/0.1 ml GSE43 (clade 2.3.2) or CKE93 (clade 7.2) virus. 
Our results revealed that 6 of 7 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens 
inoculated with GSE43 virus were dead before 7-day post-infection, but all the 
SPF chickens inoculated with CKE93 virus survived the infection. Both the GSE43 
and CKE93 viruses replicated systemically in chickens. The virus titers of GSE43 
virus in tested organs were obviously higher than those of CKE93 virus. Our 
results revealed that the pathogenicity and replication of GSE43 in chickens was 
much higher than those of CKE93. The GSE43 virus could transmit between 
chickens, but the CKE93 could not transmit between chickens by naïve contact. 
Therefore, different clades of H5N1 AIVs possessed variable pathogenicities and 
transmission abilities among chickens. Our study contributes to knowledge of 
pathogenic variations of prevalent H5N1 viruses.

Metagenomic analysis through high-throughput sequencing is a tool for detecting 
both known and novel viruses. Using this technique, a novel circular 
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus genome was discovered in respiratory 
secretions from a febrile traveler. The virus, named human 
respiratory-associated PSCV-5-like virus (HRAPLV), has a genome comprising 3,018 
bases, with two major putative ORFs inversely encoding capsid (Cap) and 
replicase (Rep) protein and separated by two intergenic regions. One stem-loop 
structure was predicted in the larger intergenic region (LIR). The predicted 
amino acid sequences of the Cap and Rep proteins of HRAPLV showed highest 
identity to those of porcine stool-associated circular virus 5 isolate CP3 
(PoSCV 5) (53.0% and 48.9%, respectively). The host tropism of the virus is 
unknown, and further study is warranted to determine whether this novel virus is 
associated with human disease.

Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV), belonging to the Flaviviridae family, is a 
single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Since April 2010, the outbreak of 
DTMUV in southeast provinces of China has caused great economic losses. 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important regulatory roles in viral infection through 
binding to the host target genes or the viral genomes. To better understanding 
the molecular mechanisms of virus-host interaction, here we identified the miRNA 
expression profiles in DTMUV-infected and uninfected DEF cells by 
high-throughput sequencing. A total of 287 known and 63 novel miRNAs were 
identified. 48 miRNAs, including 26 known miRNAs and 22 novel miRNAs, were 
differentially expressed in response to DTMUV infection. Among these miRNAs, 37 
miRNAs were up-regulated and 11 miRNAs were down-regulated. 9 miRNAs were 
randomly selected for validation by qRT-PCR experiment. The results of qRT-PCR 
experiment were consistent with the sequencing data. GO enrichment showed that 
the predicted targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs were mainly 
involved in the regulation of immune system, cellular process and metabolic 
process. KEGG pathways analysis showed that predicted target genes were involved 
in several signaling pathways such as Wnt signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling 
pathway, mTOR signaling pathway and FoxO signaling pathway. This is the first 
study to evaluate changes of miRNA expression in DEF cells upon DTMUV infection. 
Our findings provide important clues for better understanding the DTMUV-host 
interaction.

One Health—One Medicine: unifying human and animal medicine within an evolutionary paradigm,"<jats:p>One health is a concept since early civilization, which promoted the view that there was no major distinction between animal and human medicine. Although persisting through the 19th century, this common vision was then all but forgotten in the early 20th century. It is now experiencing a renaissance, coincident with an awakening of the role that evolutionary biology plays in human and animal health, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A number of STIs in humans have comparable infections in animals; likewise, both humans and animals have STIs unique to each mammalian camp. These similarities and differences offer opportunities for basic medical and public health studies, including evolutionary insights that can be gleaned from ongoing interdisciplinary investigation—especially with the molecular analytical tools available—in what can become a golden age of mutually helpful discovery.</jats:p>",0

The goal of the study was to establish if there was a relationship between 
molecular patterns and virus evolution. Therefore the complete genome sequence 
of two distinct apathogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains was determined 
and a third genome size category, containing 15,198 nucleotides, was recognized. 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two major separations resulting in three 
genome size categories occurred during the history of NDV. An ancient division 
in the primordial reservoir (wild waterbird species) led to two basal sister 
clades, class I and II, with genome sizes 15,198 (due to a 12 nucleotide insert 
in the phosphoprotein gene) and 15,186 nucleotides, respectively. Ancestors of 
only class II viruses colonized chicken populations and subsequently converted 
to virulent forms. These took place more than once and resulted in an early 
lineage [including genotypes I-IV and H33(W)] with genome size of 15,186 
nucleotides. A second division occurred in the 20th century in the secondary 
(chicken) host. This gave rise to the branching-off of a clade (including recent 
genotypes V-VIII consisting of only pathogenic viruses) with the concomitant 
insertion of six nucleotides into the 5' non-coding region of the nucleoprotein 
gene thereby increasing the genome size to 15,192 nucleotides.

Currently, fifteen bovine papillomavirus (BPV) types have been identified and 
classified into four genera: Deltapapillomavirus, Epsilonpapillomavirus, 
Dyoxipapillomavirus, and Xipapillomavirus. Here, the complete genome sequence of 
a new BPV type (BPV 04AC14) recovered from a papillomatous lesion is reported. 
The genome is 7,282 bp in length and exhibits the classic genetic organization 
and motifs of the members of Papillomaviridae. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic 
analyses revealed that BPV 04AC14 clusters with members of the Xipapillomavirus 
genus. The nucleotide sequence of the L1 capsid protein of the novel BPV is 
closely related to its counterpart, BPV3, with which it shares 79% similarity. 
These findings suggest that this virus is a new BPV type of the Xipapillomavirus 
genus.

The Zika virus epidemic that started in Brazil in 2014 has spread to >30 
countries and territories in Latin America, leading to a rapid rise in the 
incidence of microcephalic newborns and adults with neurological complications. 
At the beginning of the outbreak, little was known about Zika virus morphology, 
genome structure, modes of transmission, and its potential to cause neurological 
malformations and disorders. With the advancement of basic science, discoveries 
of the mechanisms of strain variability, viral transfer to the fetus, and 
neurovirulence were published. These will certainly lead to the development of 
strategies to block vertical viral transmission, neuronal invasion, and 
pathogenesis in the near future. This paper reviews the current literature on 
Zika virus infections, with the aim of gaining a holistic insight into their 
etiology and pathogenesis. We discuss Zika virus history and epidemiology in 
Brazil, viral structure and taxonomy, old and newly identified transmission 
modes, and neurological consequences of infection.

Louping-ill (LI), caused by louping-ill virus (LIV), results in a frequently 
fatal encephalitis primarily affecting sheep and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus 
scotica), but it does occur in other species. An adult male Border collie dog 
was definitively diagnosed with fatal LI and the lesion profile, LIV antigen 
distribution and full genome sequence of the LIV responsible were investigated 
to determine if this differed significantly from sheep-derived LIV. No gross 
lesions were present. The histological lesions were confined to the central 
nervous system and comprised of lymphocytic perivascular cuffs, glial foci, 
neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia. Immunolocalization of viral antigen showed 
small amounts present in neurons only. These histological and 
immunohistochemical findings were similar to those reported in affected sheep. 
Compared with published full genome sequences of sheep-derived LIV, only very 
minor differences were present and phylogenetically the virus clustered 
individually between a subclade containing Scottish strains, LIV 369/T2 and 
G and another subclade containing an English isolate LIV A. The LIV isolated 
from the dog shares a common progenitor with LIV A. These findings suggest there 
is no canine-specific LIV strain, dogs are susceptible to sheep-associated 
strains of LI and with the increase in tick prevalence, and therefore exposure 
to LIV, a safe, effective vaccine for dogs may be required.

We recently identified Tembusu virus (TMUV) as a causative agent of duck 
infectious disease, which has spread in China since 2010. A recent study has 
indicated a potential case of human infection by TMUV, highlighting the need for 
further study of TMUV, especially its evolution. Because no information exists 
regarding the evolution of TMUV, we conducted comprehensive phylogenetic 
analyses using the largest collection of complete open reading frame (ORF) 
sequences of TMUV. Our results indicated that two lineages of viruses were 
associated with the 2010 outbreak in China, and lineage II, in particular 
sublineage II-c, has arisen as the dominant lineage currently circulating. We 
inferred that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of this TMUV was emerged 
around 1996. Evidence of natural recombination was also detected in TMUV. 
Molecular adaptation analyses revealed that strong negative selection shaped the 
evolution of TMUV, while a number of codons subjected to positive pressure were 
also identified. Our study, for the first time, illustrated the evolutionary 
history and character of TMUV and will be helpful for vaccine and diagnostic 
development.

Characterisation of Hungarian porcine circovirus 2 genomes associated with PMWS and PDNS cases,"<jats:p>The authors report the data of the first survey on the incidence of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) in Hungary. A PCR method specific for the detection of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) was developed, which proved to be suitable for diagnostic purposes. PCR screening of organ samples from pigs suspected to be affected with PMWS or PDNS revealed the presence of PCV-2 in 80% of the cases. Six PCV-2 genomes from Hungarian isolates were completely sequenced. Phylogenetic comparison with all the available PCV-2 sequences showed that porcine circoviruses circulating in Hungary are more variable than in several other European countries. Two Hungarian strains clustered together with the Spanish strains forming a distinct group; two others fell in a common group with the French, UK, and Dutch strains, whereas another two strains showed the closest relationship to two of the three known German PCV-2 sequences.</jats:p>",0

Although Rift Valley fever is a disease that, through its wider societal 
effects, disproportionately affects vulnerable communities with poor resilience 
to economic and environmental challenge, Rift Valley fever virus has since its 
discovery in 1931 been neglected by major global donors and disease control 
programs. We describe recent outbreaks affecting humans and animals and discuss 
the serious socioeconomic effects on the communities affected and the slow pace 
of development of new vaccines. We also discuss the mixed global response, which 
has largely been fueled by the classification of the virus as a potential 
bioterrorism agent and its potential to migrate beyond its traditional eastern 
African boundaries. We argue for a refocus of strategy with increased global 
collaboration and a greater sense of urgency and investment that focuses on an 
equity-based approach in which funding and research are prioritized by need, 
inspired by principles of equity and social justice.

Development and validation of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay for rapid detection of parapoxviruses,"<jats:p> Parapoxviruses (PaPVs) cause widespread infections in ruminants worldwide. All PaPVs are zoonotic and may infect humans after direct or indirect contact with infected animals. Herein we report the development and validation of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay for rapid detection of PaPVs. The new assay (referred to as the RVSS assay) was specific for PaPVs only and had no cross-reactivity against other pox viruses. Using a recombinant plasmid as positive control, the analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined to be 16 genome copies of PaPV per assay. The amplification efficiency estimate (91–99%), the intra- and interassay variability estimate (standard deviation [SD]: 0.28–1.06 and 0.01–0.14, respectively), and the operator variability estimate (SD: 0.78 between laboratories and 0.28 between operators within a laboratory) were within the acceptable range. The diagnostic specificity was assessed on 100 specimens from healthy normal animals and all but 1 tested negative (99%). The diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) was assessed on 77 clinical specimens (skin/scab) from infected sheep, goats, and cattle, and all tested positive (100%). The assay was multiplexed with beta-actin as an internal positive control, and the multiplex assay exhibited the same DSe as the singleplex assay. Further characterization of the PaPV specimens by species-specific real-time PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products following conventional PCR showed the presence of Orf virus not only in sheep and goats but also in 1 bovid. The validated RVSS assay demonstrated high specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and ruggedness, which are critical for laboratory detection of PaPVs. </jats:p>",0
How many papillomavirus species can go undetected in papilloma lesions?,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A co-infection comprising to at least seven papillomavirus (PV) types was detected by next generation sequencing (NGS) of randomly primed rolling circle amplification (RCA) products of a bovine (<jats:italic>Bos taurus</jats:italic>) papilloma lesion from the Brazilian Amazon region. Six putative new PV types that could not be detected by commonly used PCR protocols were identified. Their overall L1 nucleotide identities were less than 90% compared to described PV species and types. L1 nucleotide BLAST sequence hits showed that each new type was related to <jats:italic>Beta, Gamma</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Dyokappa</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Dyoeta</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Xipapillomavirus</jats:italic>, as well as two likely new unclassified genera. Our results show that the employment of NGS is relevant to the detection and characterization of distantly related PV and is of major importance in co-infection studies. This knowledge will help us understand the biology and pathogenesis of PV, as well as contribute to disease control. Moreover, we can also conclude that there are many unknown circulating PVs.</jats:p>",0

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) was prevalent in swine in the United States before 
PCV2-associated disease (PCVAD) appeared in 2006. Limited nucleotide sequencing 
of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) encoding capsid, the only structural protein, 
revealed the presence of two genotypes, PCV2a and PCV2b. Later, PCV2c and mutant 
PCV2b, or PCV2d, were also described. However, extensive PCV2 ORF2 sequence 
databases in veterinary diagnostic laboratories have not been analyzed 
systematically to determine the genetic diversity of field isolates. Here, we 
interrogated >1100 PCV2 ORF2 nucleotide sequences to assess population diversity 
and genetic variation. We detected a novel PCV2 genotype that is substantially 
different, primarily in ORF2, from all known PCV2. Notably, ORF2 contains a 
unique carboxyl terminal amino acid insertion resulting in a 238 amino acid 
ORF2. All other PCV2 ORF2 proteins are 233 or 234 aa in length. Phylogenetic 
analysis indicates that it is more ancient than other PCV2 genotypes. The 
findings demonstrate the value of analyzing routine diagnostic laboratory 
sequence databases in population genetic analyses of animal pathogens.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been recognized as a swine pathogen 
for 40 years, but until 2013 had not been detected in the Western Hemisphere. 
From originally causing a relatively mild and sporadic disease, PEDV has been 
more recently associated with severe outbreaks of diarrheal disease in Asia, and 
subsequently North America. PEDV shares some important characteristics with two 
major pandemic viruses (porcine reproductive and respiratory virus; porcine 
circovirus type 2) of pigs that have high rates of mutation and high host 
specificity, and appear to have been present in the swine virome for decades 
prior to emerging to cause severe clinical disease. A unique feature of the PEDV 
in North America has been the implication of feed as a vehicle for transmission, 
with particular concerns related to ingredients of porcine origin. The 
importance of relatively rare events in contributing to both the emergence and 
transmission of PEDV is discussed in relation to approaches for managing the 
associated risks.

DNA sequence of frog adenovirus,"<jats:p>The genome of frog adenovirus (FrAdV-1) was sequenced and found to be the smallest of all known adenovirus genomes. The sequence obtained was 26163 bp in size and contains a substantial direct repeat near the right terminus, implying that it was derived by recombination from a parental genome of only 25517 bp. The closest relative of FrAdV-1 proved to be turkey adenovirus 3, an avian adenovirus with no previously known near relative. Sequence comparisons showed that the two viruses have equivalent gene complements, including one gene the product of which is related to sialidases. Phylogenetic analyses supported the establishment of a fourth adenovirus genus containing these two viruses, in addition to the established genera <jats:italic>Mastadenovirus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Aviadenovirus</jats:italic> and the proposed genus <jats:italic>Atadenovirus</jats:italic>.

Viral enteric disease is an ongoing economic burden to poultry producers 
worldwide, and despite considerable research, no single virus has emerged as a 
likely causative agent and target for prevention and control efforts. 
Historically, electron microscopy has been used to identify suspect viruses, 
with many small, round viruses eluding classification based solely on 
morphology. National and regional surveys using molecular diagnostics have 
revealed that suspect viruses continuously circulate in United States poultry, 
with many viruses appearing concomitantly and in healthy birds. High-throughput 
nucleic acid pyrosequencing is a powerful diagnostic technology capable of 
determining the full genomic repertoire present in a complex environmental 
sample. We utilized the Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX platform to compile an 
RNA virus metagenome from turkey flocks experiencing enteric disease. This 
approach yielded numerous sequences homologous to viruses in the BLAST nr 
protein database, many of which have not been described in turkeys. Our analysis 
of this turkey gut RNA metagenome focuses in particular on the turkey-origin 
members of the Picornavirales, the Caliciviridae, and the turkey 
Picobirnaviruses.

There is a great deal of interest in characterizing the complex microbial 
communities in the poultry gut, and in understanding the effects of these 
dynamic communities on poultry performance, disease status, animal welfare, and 
microbes with human health significance. Investigations characterizing the 
poultry enteric virome have identified novel poultry viruses, but the roles 
these viruses play in disease and performance problems have yet to be fully 
characterized. The complex bacterial community present in the poultry gut 
influences gut development, immune status, and animal health, each of which can 
be an indicator of overall performance. The present metagenomic investigation 
was undertaken to provide insight into the colonization of specific pathogen 
free chickens by enteric microorganisms under field conditions and to compare 
the pre-contact intestinal microbiome with the altered microbiome following 
contact with poultry raised in the field. Analysis of the intestinal virome from 
contact birds (""sentinels"") placed on farms revealed colonization by members of 
the Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, and Astroviridae that were not 
present in pre-contact birds or present in proportionally lower numbers. 
Analysis of the sentinel gut bacterial community revealed an altered community 
in the post-contact birds, notably by members of the Lachnospiracea/Clostridium 
and Lactobacillus families and genera. Members of the avian enteric Reoviridae 
and Astroviridae have been well-characterized and have historically been 
implicated in poultry enteric disease; members of the Picobirnaviridae and 
Picornaviridae have only relatively recently been described in the poultry and 
avian gut, and their roles in the recognized disease syndromes and in poultry 
performance in general have not been determined. This metagenomic analysis has 
provided insight into the colonization of the poultry gut by enteric microbes 
circulating in commercial broiler flocks, and has identified enteric viruses and 
virus communities that warrant further study in order to understand their 
role(s) in avian gut health and disease.

Molecular and phylogenetic analysis of a novel turkey-origin picobirnavirus.

Day JM, Zsak L.

A previous metagenomic analysis of the turkey gut RNA virus community identified 
novel enteric viruses that may play roles in poultry enteric diseases or in 
performance problems noted in the field. As part of the molecular 
characterization of these novel enteric viruses, a reverse transcriptase-PCR 
diagnostic assay was developed, targeting a novel turkey-origin picobirnavirus 
(PBV) initially identified in a pooled intestinal sample from turkey poults in 
North Carolina. Little detailed molecular information exists regarding the 
family Picobirnaviridae, particularly for the PBVs that have been described in 
avian species. This diagnostic assay targets the turkey PBV RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase gene and produces an 1135-bp amplicon. This assay was validated using 
in vitro transcribed RNA and was tested using archived enteric samples collected 
from turkey flocks in the southeastern United States. Further, a phylogenetic 
analysis suggests the turkey PBV is unique because it does not group closely 
with the recognized PBV genogroups circulating in mammalian hosts.

Recent metagenomic analyses of the enteric viromes in turkeys and chickens have 
revealed complex viral communities comprised of multiple viral families. Of 
particular significance are the novel avian picobirnaviruses (family 
Picobirnaviridae), multiple genera of tailed phages (family Siphoviridae), and 
undescribed avian enteric picornaviruses (family Picornaviridae). In addition to 
these largely undescribed-and therefore relatively poorly understood-poultry 
enteric viral families, these metagenomic analyses have also revealed the 
presence of well-known groups of enteric viruses such as the chicken and turkey 
astroviruses (family Astroviridae) and the avian rotaviruses and reoviruses 
(family Reoviridae). The order Picornavirales is a group of viruses in flux, 
particularly among the avian picornaviruses, since several new genera have been 
described recently based upon community analysis of enteric viromes from poultry 
and other avian species worldwide. Our previous investigation of the turkey 
enteric picornaviruses suggests the avian enteric picornaviruses may contribute 
to the enteric disease syndromes and performance problems often observed in 
turkeys in the Southeastern United States. This report describes our recent 
phylogenetic analysis of turkey and chicken enteric samples archived at the 
Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory from 2004 to present and is a first step 
in placing these novel avian picornaviruses within the larger Picornaviridae 
family.

High global diversity of cycloviruses amongst dragonflies,"<jats:p>Members of the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, specifically the genus <jats:italic>Circovirus</jats:italic>, were thought to infect only vertebrates; however, members of a sister group under the same family, the proposed genus <jats:italic>Cyclovirus</jats:italic>, have been detected recently in insects. In an effort to explore the diversity of cycloviruses and better understand the evolution of these novel ssDNA viruses, here we present five cycloviruses isolated from three dragonfly species (<jats:italic>Orthetrum sabina</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Xanthocnemis zealandica</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Rhionaeschna multicolor</jats:italic>) collected in Australia, New Zealand and the USA, respectively. The genomes of these five viruses share similar genome structure to other cycloviruses, with a circular ~1.7 kb genome and two major bidirectionally transcribed ORFs. The genomic sequence data gathered during this study were combined with all cyclovirus genomes available in public databases to identify conserved motifs and regulatory elements in the intergenic regions, as well as determine diversity and recombinant regions within their genomes. The genomes reported here represent four different cyclovirus species, three of which are novel. Our results confirm that cycloviruses circulate widely in winged-insect populations; in eight different cyclovirus species identified in dragonflies to date, some of these exhibit a broad geographical distribution. Recombination analysis revealed both intra- and inter-species recombination events amongst cycloviruses, including genomes recovered from disparate sources (e.g. goat meat and human faeces). Similar to other well-characterized circular ssDNA viruses, recombination may play an important role in cyclovirus evolution.</jats:p>",0

The objective of the present study was to detect hepatitis E virus (HEV) in 
different samples from naturally infected pigs and to characterise genetically 
the detected strains. Serum, bile, liver, lymph nodes and faeces of 69 animals 
from 1 week to 4 months of age with different pathological conditions were 
collected. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect 
HEV and histopathology of tissues was conducted. Positive RT-PCR samples were 
sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. HEV was detected in at least one sample 
in 26 out of 69 animals (37.7%). Bile was the most frequently positive sample, 
followed by mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, faeces and serum. HEV was detected in 
pigs of 1 (n = 7), 2 (n = 8) and 3 (n = 11) months of age. A total of 22 of 69 
(31.9%) pigs had mild to moderate hepatitis and 15 of them were HEV RT-PCR 
positive in at least one of the tested samples. The highest sensitivity of viral 
detection was achieved using samples that cannot be obtained from live pigs, 
such as liver, mesenteric lymph node and bile. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed 
that all Spanish swine HEV strains detected belonged to genotype III. Therefore, 
genotype III strains are present in a relative high proportion of pigs between 1 
and 3 months of age. Through this study, it cannot be ruled out if concomitant 
infections may influence the distribution of HEV in infected pigs.

In order to explore the occurrence of antigenic drift in swine influenza A(H1N1) 
viruses and the match between epidemic and vaccine strains, 26 virus isolates 
from outbreaks of respiratory disease among finishing pigs in the Netherlands in 
the 1995/1996 season and reference strains from earlier outbreaks were examined 
using serological and molecular methods. In contrast to swine H3N2 viruses, no 
significant antigenic drift was observed in swine H1N1 viruses isolated from the 
late 1980s up to 1996 inclusive. However, a marked antigenic and genetic 
heterogeneity in haemagglutination inhibition tests and nucleotide sequence 
analyses was detected among the 26 recent swine H1N1 virus strains. 
Interestingly, the observed antigenic and molecular variants were not randomly 
distributed over the farms. This finding indicates independent introductions of 
different swine H1N1 virus variants at the various farms of the study and points 
to a marked difference between the epidemiologies of human and swine influenza 
viruses. The observed heterogeneity may hamper the control of swine influenza by 
vaccination and indicates that the efficacy of current swine influenza vaccines 
requires re-evaluation and that the antigenic reactivity of swine influenza 
viruses should be monitored on a regular basis.

In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of new 
species potentially belonging to the Totiviridae family. Most of these new 
viruses have not yet been covered by the Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 
official classification. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis including new 
sequences of Totiviridae candidates revealed a clade including Giardiavirus and 
a great diversity of new totiviruses, which infect arthropods, protozoa and 
mollusc. This expanded Giardiavirus clade comprises two monophyletic groups, one 
of them including Giardia lamblia virus (GLV) grouped with viruses that infect 
arthropods and vertebrates (GLV-like group), and the other includes the 
previously proposed Artivirus group (IMNV-like group). A screening of the 
members of the GLV-like group in search of genomic elements already described in 
IMNV-like group revealed the existence of sites with a high propensity to become 
2 A-like oligopeptides, mainly in a specific subgroup of arthropod viruses, 
suggesting that these viruses preserved ancestral characteristics. The existence 
of these ""pseudo 2 A-sites"" associated to phylogenetic reconstruction indicates 
that these sequences appear at a decisive stage for viral evolution. If they are 
changed to functional 2 A-like sequences, an irreversible route to increase the 
genome complexity will be initiated.

Akabane, Aino and Schmallenberg virus-where do we stand and what do we know 
about the role of domestic ruminant hosts and Culicoides vectors in virus 
transmission and overwintering?

Akabane, Aino and Schmallenberg virus belong to the Simbu serogroup of 
Orthobunyaviruses and depend on Culicoides vectors for their spread between 
ruminant hosts. Infections of adults are mostly asymptomatic or associated with 
only mild symptoms, while transplacental crossing of these viruses to the 
developing fetus can have important teratogenic effects. Research mainly focused 
on congenital malformations has established a correlation between the 
developmental stage at which a fetus is infected and the outcome of an Akabane 
virus infection. Available data suggest that a similar correlation also applies 
to Schmallenberg virus infections but is not yet entirely conclusive. 
Experimental and field data furthermore suggest that Akabane virus is more 
efficient in inducing congenital malformations than Aino and Schmallenberg 
virus, certainly in cattle. The mechanism by which these Simbu viruses 
cross-pass yearly periods of very low vector abundance in temperate climate 
zones remains undefined. Yearly wind-borne reintroductions of infected midges 
from tropical endemic regions with year-round vector activity have been 
proposed, just as overwintering in long-lived adult midges. Experimental and 
field data however indicate that a role of vertical virus transmission in the 
ruminant host currently cannot be excluded as an overwintering mechanism. More 
studies on Culicoides biology and specific groups of transplacentally infected 
newborn ruminants without gross malformations are needed to shed light on this 
matter.

Bovine papular stomatitis affecting dairy cows and milkers in midwestern Brazil,"<jats:p> Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) is a parapoxvirus associated with papular and erosive lesions on the muzzle, lips, and oral mucosa of cattle. Teats of milking cows are occasionally affected, and the infection is frequently transmitted to human beings. The present report describes an outbreak of BPSV infection affecting cows in midwestern Brazil, with human involvement. The disease was observed in neighboring small hand-milking farms, affecting 20 milking cows. The signs included painful reddish papules, ulcers, and scabby proliferative lesions on the teats, with a clinical course of 7–12 days. Affected cows presented severe local pain, not allowing the completion of milking. Histologically, acanthosis, spongiosis, and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis with adjacent focally extensive ulcers and multifocal inflammatory infiltrate were observed in the epidermis. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies were noted in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Personnel milking the affected cows developed lesions on the hands, painful papules that progressed to ulcerative and scabby lesions in 4–7 days. A polymerase chain reaction using a set of pan-parapoxvirus primers for the B2L gene performed on DNA extracted from scabs amplified a 590-bp product, which when sequenced, revealed similarities of 99%, 85%, and 84% with BPSV, Pseudocowpox virus, and Orf virus, respectively. A phylogenetic tree based on the B2L sequence was constructed, showing that the virus clustered with BPSV isolates. Although clinical cases compatible with BSPV infection have been frequently described in Brazil, the present report identifies the agent associated with cattle and human disease in the country. </jats:p>",0
Novel Parvoviruses from Wild and Domestic Animals in Brazil Provide New Insights into Parvovirus Distribution and Diversity,"<jats:p>Parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) are small, single-stranded DNA viruses. Many parvoviral pathogens of medical, veterinary and ecological importance have been identified. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate the diversity of parvoviruses infecting wild and domestic animals in Brazil. We identified 21 parvovirus sequences (including twelve nearly complete genomes and nine partial genomes) in samples derived from rodents, bats, opossums, birds and cattle in Pernambuco, São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul states. These sequences were investigated using phylogenetic and distance-based approaches and were thereby classified into eight parvovirus species (six of which have not been described previously), representing six distinct genera in the subfamily Parvovirinae. Our findings extend the known biogeographic range of previously characterized parvovirus species and the known host range of three parvovirus genera (Dependovirus, Aveparvovirus and Tetraparvovirus). Moreover, our investigation provides a window into the ecological dynamics of parvovirus infections in vertebrates, revealing that many parvovirus genera contain well-defined sub-lineages that circulate widely throughout the world within particular taxonomic groups of hosts.</jats:p>",0

Foamy viruses (FVs) or spumaviruses were described for the first time in the 
early 1950s in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys. Later, FVs were 
isolated in several mammal species such as cats, cattle and horses. Highly 
prevalent in non-human primates they are not naturally present in humans, 
although several cases of simian-to-human transmissions have been described. 
Interestingly, the replication strategy of FVs differs in many aspects from that 
of other retroviruses, presenting features that are closely related to 
pararetroviruses, exemplified by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), but also 
characteristics that are closely related to yeast retrotransposons. These 
characteristics led to the creation of a distinct viral subfamily by the 
International Committee on Virus Taxonomy in 2002; the Spumaretrovirinae.

The characterization of viral genomes has accelerated due to improvement in DNA 
sequencing technology. Sources of animal samples and molecular methods for the 
identification of novel viral pathogens and steps to determine their 
pathogenicity are listed. The difficulties for predicting future cross-species 
transmissions are highlighted by the wide diversity of known viral zoonoses. 
Recent surveys of viruses in wild and domesticated animals have characterized 
numerous viruses including some closely related to those infecting humans. The 
detection of multiple genetic lineages within viral families infecting a single 
host species, phylogenetically interspersed with viruses found in other host 
species, reflects past cross-species transmissions. Numerous opportunities for 
the generation of novel vaccines will arise from a better understanding of 
animal viromes.

Monitoring the immune response to vaccination with an inactivated vaccine associated to bovine neonatal pancytopenia by deep sequencing transcriptome analysis in cattle,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) is a new fatal, alloimmune/alloantibody mediated disease of new-born calves induced by ingestion of colostrum from cows, which had been vaccinated with a specific vaccine against the Bovine Virus Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV). The hypothesis of pathogenic MHC class I molecules in the vaccine had been put up, but no formal proof of specific causal MHC class I alleles has been provided yet. However, the unique features of the vaccine obviously result in extremely high specific antibody titres in the vaccinated animals, but apparently also in further molecules inducing BNP. Thus, a comprehensive picture of the immune response to the vaccine is essential. Applying the novel approach of next generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq), our study provides a new holistic, comprehensive analysis of the blood transcriptome regulation after vaccination with the specific BVDV vaccine. Our RNAseq approach identified a novel cytokine-like gene in the bovine genome that is highly upregulated after vaccination. This gene has never been described before in any other species and might be specific to ruminant immune response. Furthermore, our data revealed a very coordinated immune response to double-stranded (ds) RNA or a dsRNA analogue after vaccination with the inactivated single-stranded (ss) RNA vaccine. This would suggest either a substantial contamination of the vaccine with dsRNA from host cells after virus culture or a dsRNA analogue applied to the vaccine. The first option would highlight the potential risks associated with virus culture on homologous cells during vaccine production; the latter option would emphasise the potential risks associated with immune stimulating adjuvants used in vaccine production.</jats:p>",0

Recent studies show that human skin at homeostasis is a complex ecosystem whose 
virome include circular DNA viruses, especially papillomaviruses and 
polyomaviruses. To determine the chicken skin virome in comparison with human 
skin virome, a chicken swabs pool sample from fifteen indoor healthy chickens of 
five genetic backgrounds was examined for the presence of DNA viruses by 
high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The results indicate a predominance of 
herpesviruses from the Mardivirus genus, coming from either vaccinal origin or 
presumably asymptomatic infection. Despite the high sensitivity of the HTS 
method used herein to detect small circular DNA viruses, we did not detect any 
papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, or circoviruses, indicating that these viruses 
may not be resident of the chicken skin. The results suggest that the turkey 
herpesvirus is a resident of chicken skin in vaccinated chickens. This study 
indicates major differences between the skin viromes of chickens and humans. The 
origin of this difference remains to be further studied in relation with skin 
physiology, environment, or virus population dynamics.

By analyzing the E2 sequences of classical swine fever virus from field 
outbreaks in Taiwan during 1993-2001, three virus populations with distinct 
genotypes were determined including one historical (subgroup 3.4) and two exotic 
(subgroup 2.1) strains. The first subgroup 2.1 virus was isolated in 1994 and 
further sporadic outbreaks occurred after 1996. Phylogenetic analysis using the 
E2 region has segregated the Taiwanese strains of 2.1 virus into two different 
genotypes (termed 2.1a and 2.1b). The 2.1b viruses were only isolated in 2001 
and shared approximately 94.8% nucleotide identities to the 2.1a viruses in the 
total genomic sequences. The results suggest that the 2.1a and 2.1b viruses may 
be introduced from different origins.

Pathogenic H7N9 influenza viruses continue to pose a public health concern. The 
H7N9 virus has caused five outbreak waves of human infections in China since 
2013. In the present study, a novel H7N9 strain (A/Guangdong/8H324/2017) was 
isolated from a female patient with severe respiratory illness during the fifth 
wave of the 2017 H7N9 epidemic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the H7N9 
viruses collected during the fifth wave belong to two different lineages: the 
Pearl River Delta lineage and the Yangtze River Delta lineage. The novel isolate 
is closely related to the Pearl River Delta H7N9 viruses, which were isolated 
from patients in Guangdong Province. The novel H7N9 isolate has an insertion of 
three basic amino acids in the cleavage site of hemagglutinin (HA), which may 
enhance virulence in poultry. The 2017 isolate also possesses an R292K 
substitution in the neuraminidase (NA) protein, which confers oseltamivir 
resistance. This study highlights the pandemic potential of the novel H7N9 virus 
in mammals; thus, future characterization and surveillance is warranted.

Nested RT-PCR was used to investigate bovine viral diarrhea virus in 511 
specimens collected from Chinese pigs exhibiting clinical symptoms between 2007 
and 2010. Of these, 137 samples were BVDV-positive and the BVDV prevalence rate 
was 23.1% (9/39) in 2007, 27.7% (44/159) in 2008, 33.6% (34/101) in 2009, and 
23.6% (50/212) in 2010. Twenty of 137 BVDV-positive samples were used for 
further genetic analysis of the 5'-UTR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they 
were BVDV-1 and subtyped into BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, BVDV-1m, BVDV-1o and an unknown 
subgenotype. This study showed that BVDVs were highly prevalent in Chinese pig 
herds and appropriate measures should be taken to control BVDV prevalence in pig 
herds.

The composition of the porcine virome includes viruses that infect pig cells, 
ancient virus-derived elements including endogenous retroviruses inserted in the 
pig chromosomes, and bacteriophages that infect a broad array of bacteria that 
inhabit pigs. Viruses infecting pigs, among them viruses also infecting human 
cells, as well as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are of importance when 
evaluating the virus safety of xenotransplantation. Bacteriophages associated 
with bacteria mainly in the gut are not relevant in this context. 
Xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues or organs is under development in 
order to alleviate the shortage of human transplants. Here for the first time 
published data describing the viromes in different pigs and their relevance for 
the virus safety of xenotransplantation is analysed. In conclusion, the analysis 
of the porcine virome has resulted in numerous new viruses being described, 
although their impact on xenotransplantation is unclear. Most importantly, 
viruses with known or suspected zoonotic potential were often not detected by 
next generation sequencing, but were revealed by more sensitive methods.

Insights into Circovirus Host Range from the Genomic Fossil Record,"<jats:p>Advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the rate at which new viruses are being identified. However, the host species associations of most virus sequences identified in metagenomic samples are difficult to determine. Our analysis indicates that viruses proposed to infect vertebrates (in some cases being linked to human disease) may in fact be restricted to arthropod hosts. The detection of these sequences in vertebrate samples may reflect their widespread presence in the environment as viruses of parasitic arthropods.</jats:p>",0
Deep Sequencing of Distinct Preparations of the Live Attenuated Varicella-Zoster Virus Vaccine Reveals a Conserved Core of Attenuating Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The continued success of the live attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine in preventing varicella-zoster and herpes zoster is well documented, as are many of the mutations that contribute to the attenuation of the vOka virus for replication in skin. At least three different preparations of vOka are marketed. Here, we show using deep sequencing of seven batches of vOka vaccine (including ZostaVax, VariVax, VarilRix, and the Oka/Biken working seed) from three different manufacturers (VariVax, GSK, and Biken) that 137 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations are present in all vaccine batches. This includes six sites at which the vaccine allele is fixed or near fixation, which we speculate are likely to be important for attenuation. We also show that despite differences in the vaccine populations between preparations, batch-to-batch variation is minimal, as is the number and frequency of mutations unique to individual batches. This suggests that the vaccine manufacturing processes are not introducing new mutations and that, notwithstanding the mixture of variants present, VZV live vaccines are extremely stable.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            The continued success of vaccinations to prevent chickenpox and shingles, combined with the extremely low incidence of adverse reactions, indicates the quality of these vaccines. The vaccine itself is comprised of a heterogeneous live attenuated virus population and thus requires deep-sequencing technologies to explore the differences and similarities in the virus populations between different preparations and batches of the vaccines. Our data demonstrate minimal variation between batches, an important safety feature, and provide new insights into the extent of the mutations present in this attenuated virus.

Classical swine fever (CSF) caused by Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a 
globally significant disease of pigs. Genetic typing of CSFV isolates can help 
in understanding the epidemiology of disease and trace down the source of 
outbreak. 5'-UTR sequence analysis and subsequent genetic classification of nine 
CSFV field isolates from India indicated that 3 isolates belonged to genotype 
2.1 and were closely related to European CSFV strains. The remaining 6 isolates 
belonged to genotype 1 that contained old and new strains. However, the genotype 
2.1 group consisted of recent field isolates only. The study showed circulation 
of both genotypes 1 and 2.1 in north-eastern part of India.

The study details characterization of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates 
recovered from commercial poultry flocks (chicken) and wild birds (crane) of 
India during the time period from 1989 to 2013. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
that most of the NDV isolates belongs to class II, genotype XIIIa and a chicken 
isolate (108/BAREILLY/AD-IVRI/91) was of genotype VI, where it showed diversity 
of 3 % from the other viruses belonging to same genotype. Another chicken 
isolate (75/RAMPUR/AD-IVRI/89) grouped in genotype III and showed 4 % diversity 
with viruses of genotype III. The crane origin NDV identified as of genotype II 
corresponding to the vaccine virus. This appears to be the first report about 
existence of genotype XIIIa and its ancestral viruses are circulating in India 
for the last two decades in different species of birds. Furthermore, genetically 
distinct viruses belonging to genotypes II, III and VI are also circulating in 
India.

We report that the bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) UL28 ORF, a homologue of the 
herpes simplex virus (HSV) UL28 gene, represents a functional gene encoding a 
viral specific protein. The BHV1 UL28 ORF, located at positions 53058-->55538 of 
the viral genome, encodes a viral specific transcript of 3.4 kb detected at 6 h 
post-infection (p.i.) after which its levels accumulated up to 12 h p.i. and 
then remained constant up to 24 h p.i. Transcription of the BHV1 UL28 was 
determined to initiate 95 bases upstream from the ORF's initiating codon, which 
corresponds to 33 nucleotides downstream from a putative TATA box. A BHV1 UL28 
specific antiserum, generated against a T7-Tag/UL28 fusion protein expressed in 
E. coli, specifically reacted with a 100 kDa protein in Western blots of 
BHV1-infected protein cell lysates. The expression kinetics of the protein was 
delayed by 6 h relative to that of its transcript suggesting that the gene is 
regulated at the translational level. In contrast to the HSV and pseudorabies 
virus UL28 genes, which belong to viral genes of the early (beta) class, that of 
BHV1 was unambiguously classified as a gamma2 gene. Further studies will be 
required to determine whether these kinetic differences have any functional 
implications.

Enrichment of Viral Nucleic Acids by Solution Hybrid Selection with Genus Specific Oligonucleotides,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Despite recent advances, our knowledge of potential and rare human pathogens is far from exhaustive. Current molecular diagnostic tools mainly rely on the specific amplification of marker sequences and may overlook infections caused by unknown and rare pathogens. Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) can solve this problem; but, due to the extremely low fraction of pathogen genetic material in clinical samples, its application is only cost-effective in special, rather than routine, cases. In this study, we present a method for the semi-specific enrichment of viral conservative sequences in a HTS library by hybridization in solution with genus-specific degenerate biotinylated oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids of the test viruses (yellow fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus) were enriched by solution hybrid selection using pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides. Moreover, enterovirus (family: <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>, genus: <jats:italic>Enterovirus</jats:italic>) sequences were successfully enriched using foot-and-mouth disease virus (family: <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>, genus: <jats:italic>Aphthovirus</jats:italic>) oligonucleotide. The enrichment factor relative to the background nucleic acid was about 1,000-fold. As hybridization has less stringent oligonucleotide match requirements than PCR, few oligonucleotides are sufficient to cover the potential sequence variation in the whole genus and may even enrich nucleic acids of viruses of other related genera. Efficient enrichment of viral sequences makes its use in diagnostics cost-efficient.</jats:p>",0
Megaphages infect Prevotella and variants are widespread in gut microbiomes,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Bacteriophages (phages) dramatically shape microbial community composition, redistribute nutrients via host lysis and drive evolution through horizontal gene transfer. Despite their importance, much remains to be learned about phages in the human microbiome. We investigated the gut microbiomes of humans from Bangladesh and Tanzania, two African baboon social groups and Danish pigs; many of these microbiomes contain phages belonging to a clade with genomes &gt;540 kilobases in length, the largest yet reported in the human microbiome and close to the maximum size ever reported for phages. We refer to these as Lak phages. CRISPR spacer targeting indicates that Lak phages infect bacteria of the genus <jats:italic>Prevotella</jats:italic>. We manually curated to completion 15 distinct Lak phage genomes recovered from metagenomes. The genomes display several interesting features, including use of an alternative genetic code, large intergenic regions that are highly expressed and up to 35 putative transfer RNAs, some of which contain enigmatic introns. Different individuals have distinct phage genotypes, and shifts in variant frequencies over consecutive sampling days reflect changes in the relative abundance of phage subpopulations. Recent homologous recombination has resulted in extensive genome admixture of nine baboon Lak phage populations. We infer that Lak phages are widespread in gut communities that contain the <jats:italic>Prevotella</jats:italic> species, and conclude that megaphages, with fascinating and underexplored biology, may be common but largely overlooked components of human and animal gut microbiomes.</jats:p>",0
Molecular and Antigenic Characterization of Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) from Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss),"<jats:p>Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV-1) causes heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Recently, a novel PRV (formerly PRV-Om, here called PRV-3), was found in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with HSMI-like disease. PRV is considered to be an emerging pathogen in farmed salmonids. In this study, molecular and antigenic characterization of PRV-3 was performed. Erythrocytes are the main target cells for PRV, and blood samples that were collected from experimentally challenged fish were used as source of virus. Virus particles were purified by gradient ultracentrifugation and the complete coding sequences of PRV-3 were obtained by Illumina sequencing. When compared to PRV-1, the nucleotide identity of the coding regions was 80.1%, and the amino acid identities of the predicted PRV-3 proteins varied from 96.7% (λ1) to 79.1% (σ3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PRV-3 belongs to a separate cluster. The region encoding σ3 were sequenced from PRV-3 isolates collected from rainbow trout in Europe. These sequences clustered together, but were distant from PRV-3 that was isolated from rainbow trout in Norway. Bioinformatic analyses of PRV-3 proteins revealed that predicted secondary structures and functional domains were conserved between PRV-3 and PRV-1. Rabbit antisera raised against purified virus or various recombinant virus proteins from PRV-1 all cross-reacted with PRV-3. Our findings indicate that despite different species preferences of the PRV subtypes, several genetic, antigenic, and structural properties are conserved between PRV-1 and-3.</jats:p>",0

Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an economically important viral disease of 
goats and sheep first described in west Africa in the 1940s. The virus has been 
circulating in parts of sub-Saharan Africa for several decades and in the Middle 
East and southern Asia since 1993, although the first description of the virus 
in India dates to 1987. To study the genetic relationship between isolates of 
distinct geographical origin, a selected region of the fusion (F) protein gene 
of the viruses was amplified using RT/PCR and the resulting DNA product 
sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Viruses from 27 outbreaks in Asian and 
Middle Eastern countries, reported between 1993 and 2000, and two recent 
outbreaks from the African continent were compared with the prototype African 
strain. Of the four known lineages of PPR virus, lineage 1 and 2 viruses have 
been found exclusively in west Africa. Virus from an outbreak in Burkina Faso in 
1999 fell into the lineage 1 group. Viruses of lineage 3 have been found in east 
Africa, where an outbreak in Ethiopia in 1996 was of this type, and also in 
Arabia and in southern India. However, there have been no further isolations of 
lineage 3 virus from India since the one reported in 1992 from Tamil Nadu. A 
virus of this lineage was found circulating in Yemen in 2001. In the past 8 
years virus exclusively of the fourth lineage has spread across the Middle East 
and the Asian sub-continent, reaching east as far as Nepal and Bangladesh. This 
virus lineage was also reported from Kuwait in 1999. The geographical source of 
the new lineage 4 virus is unknown although it is most closely related to 
African lineage 1. The possibility that its earlier presence in northern India 
was masked by the circulation of Rinderpest virus, a related virus of cattle, is 
considered unlikely.

Temperate coliphages: classification and correlation with habitats,"<jats:p>Temperate coliphages were recovered from sewage, mammalian feces, and lysogenic strains of Escherichia coli. A total of 32 phages of independent origin were divided into six groups by applying the criteria of host range, antigenic homology, and the ultraviolet inducibility of the prophage. The demonstration of genetic interactions in some cases has confirmed the classification scheme. Nine phages were assigned to the P2 family and 19 to the lambda family. The remaining four isolates may represent some novel phylogenetic types. Phages recovered from the lysogenic strains of E. coli were all found to be P2 related, whereas a majority of the phages recovered as cell-free plaque-forming units were assignable to the lambda family. It is proposed that the biological attributes of the phages belonging to the two principal families are reflected in the distribution patterns observed. The virions of phage HK256 show multiple tail fibers and may thus represent a ""new"" virion form among the temperate coliphages.</jats:p>",0

Neboviruses are bovine enteric caliciviruses (genus Nebovirus) associated with 
enteric diseases in calves. By screening the stools of calves collected from 
Italian herds using primers targeted to a conserved stretch in calicivirus 
RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), nebovirus RNA was detected in calves with 
enteritis (13.1%) but not in overtly health animals. Upon sequence analysis of 
the RdRp fragment, the Italian viruses formed a tightly conserved group and 
resembled closely the nebovirus prototype Nebraska/80/US. The sequence of a 
2.2kb ORF1 fragment, spanning the 3' end of the RdRp and the full-length capsid 
coding region, of two nebovirus strains was determined, revealing marked genetic 
heterogeneity in the capsid protein, as the two Italian viruses were classified 
into two distinct capsid lineages, and suggesting a recombination event 
downstream the highly conserved shell (S) domain.

To gain insight into the evolution of influenza A viruses (IAVs) during 
infection of vaccinated pigs, we experimentally infected a 3-week-old naive pig 
with a triple-reassortant H1N1 IAV and placed the seeder pig in direct contact 
with a group of age-matched vaccinated pigs (n = 10). We indexed the genetic 
diversity and evolution of the virus at an intra-host level by deep sequencing 
the entire genome directly from nasal swabs collected at two separate samplings 
during infection. We obtained 13 IAV metagenomes from 13 samples, which included 
the virus inoculum and two samples from each of the six pigs that tested 
positive for IAV during the study. The infection produced a population of 
heterogeneous alleles (sequence variants) that was dynamic over time. Overall, 
794 polymorphisms were identified amongst all samples, which yielded 327 
alleles, 214 of which were unique sequences. A total of 43 distinct 
haemagglutinin proteins were translated, two of which were observed in multiple 
pigs, whereas the neuraminidase (NA) was conserved and only one dominant NA was 
found throughout the study. The genetic diversity of IAVs changed dynamically 
within and between pigs. However, most of the substitutions observed in the 
internal gene segments were synonymous. Our results demonstrated remarkable IAV 
diversity, and the complex, rapid and dynamic evolution of IAV during infection 
of vaccinated pigs that can only be appreciated with repeated sampling of 
individual animals and deep sequence analysis.

Molecular Characteristics of the Nipah Virus Glycoproteins,"<jats:p><jats:bold><jats:sc>Abstract: </jats:sc></jats:bold>  <jats:bold>Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus, which emerged in 1998 from fruit bats in Malaysia and caused an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in pigs and fatal encephalitis in humans with high mortality rates. In contrast to most paramyxoviruses, NiV can infect a large variety of mammalian species. Due to this broad host range, its zoonotic potential, its high pathogenicity for humans, and the lack of effective vaccines or therapeutics, NiV was classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen. This article provides an overview of the molecular characteristics of NiV focusing on the structure, functions, and unique biological properties of the two NiV surface glycoproteins, the receptor‐binding G protein, and the fusion protein F. Since viral glycoproteins are major determinants for cell tropism and virus spread, a detailed knowledge of these proteins can help to understand the molecular basis of viral pathogenicity.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",0

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been thought to only infect avian species. 
However, at least eight NDV strains were isolated from swine populations in 
China during 1999-2006, four of which were characterized genetically and 
phylogenetically. Genetic analysis revealed that JL106 and SP13 had a 
(112)G-R-Q-G-R-L(117) motif at the cleavage site of F protein, while JL01 and 
MP01 possessed a (112)G-K-Q-G-R-L(117) motif, which indicated that all of them 
were typical of low-virulence viruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 
full-length F gene sequences showed that JL106 and SP13 belonged to genotype II, 
similar to the commonly utilized commercial La Sota vaccine strain in China. 
While JL01 and MP01 clustered within genotype I, genetically identical to the V4 
vaccine strain. The animal trials showed that JL106 can effectively infect 
chickens. The present results indicated that the use of live La Sota and V4 
vaccines and close contact between avian and pigs maybe resulted in 
cross-species infection, therefore, it is necessary to further carry out swine 
NDV epidemiology surveillance.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) play a critical role in post-transcriptional regulation by 
influencing the 3'-UTR of target genes. Using two inbred White Leghorn chicken 
lines, line 6.3 and line 7.2 showing Marek's disease-resistant and -susceptible 
phenotypes, respectively, we used small RNA high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to 
investigate whether miRNAs are differently expressed in these two chicken lines 
after inducing necrotic enteritis (NE). The 12 miRNAs, selected from the most 
down-regulated or up-regulated miRNAs following NE induction, were confirmed by 
their expressions in real-time PCR. Among these miRNAs, miR-215, miR-217, 
miR-194, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-216a, miR-216b, and miR-429 were highly 
expressed in intestine derived from line 7.2, whereas, miR-1782 and miR-499 were 
down-regulated. In spleen, miR-34b and miR-1684 were the most up-regulated 
miRNAs in line 6.3. Notably, five out of six target genes, CXCR5, BCL2, GJA1, 
TCF12, and TAB3 were differentially expressed between line 6.3 and line 7.2, and 
showed suppression in the MD-susceptible chicken line. Their expression levels 
were conversely correlated with those of miRNA obtained from both HTS and 
quantitative real-time PCR. These results suggest that some miRNAs are 
differentially altered in response to NE and they modulate the expression of 
their target genes in the two inbred lines. Collectively, HTS analysis of 
intestinal miRNAs from NE-afflicted inbred chickens showing different disease 
phenotypes led to the identification of host immunity genes regulated by miRNA. 
Future studies of the function of these miRNAs and their target genes in the 
host will lead to enhanced understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling 
host-pathogen interaction in NE.

Freshwater lakes and ponds present an ecological interface between humans and a 
variety of host organisms. They are a habitat for the larval stage of many 
insects and may serve as a medium for intraspecies and interspecies transmission 
of viruses such as avian influenza A virus. Furthermore, freshwater bodies are 
already known repositories for disease-causing viruses such as Norwalk Virus, 
Coxsackievirus, Echovirus, and Adenovirus. While RNA virus populations have been 
studied in marine environments, to this date there has been very limited 
analysis of the viral community in freshwater. Here we present a survey of RNA 
viruses in Lake Needwood, a freshwater lake in Maryland, USA. Our results 
indicate that just as in studies of other aquatic environments, the majority of 
nucleic acid sequences recovered did not show any significant similarity to 
known sequences. The remaining sequences are mainly from viral types with 
significant similarity to approximately 30 viral families. We speculate that 
these novel viruses may infect a variety of hosts including plants, insects, 
fish, domestic animals and humans. Among these viruses we have discovered a 
previously unknown dsRNA virus closely related to Banna Virus which is 
responsible for a febrile illness and is endemic to Southeast Asia. Moreover we 
found multiple viral sequences distantly related to Israeli Acute Paralysis 
virus which has been implicated in honeybee colony collapse disorder. Our data 
suggests that due to their direct contact with humans, domestic and wild 
animals, freshwater ecosystems might serve as repositories of a wide range of 
viruses (both pathogenic and non-pathogenic) and possibly be involved in the 
spread of emerging and pandemic diseases.

"Zoonotic Hepatitis E Virus: Classiﬁcation, Animal Reservoirs and Transmission Routes","<jats:p>During the past ten years, several new hepatitis E viruses (HEVs) have been identiﬁed in various animal species. In parallel, the number of reports of autochthonous hepatitis E in Western countries has increased as well, raising the question of what role these possible animal reservoirs play in human infections. The aim of this review is to present the recent discoveries of animal HEVs and their classiﬁcation within the Hepeviridae family, their zoonotic and species barrier crossing potential, and possible use as models to study hepatitis E pathogenesis. Lastly, this review describes the transmission pathways identiﬁed from animal sources.</jats:p>",0
Sequence analysis of a porcine enterovirus serotype 1 isolate: relationships with other picornaviruses,<jats:p>The majority of the genomic sequence of a porcine enterovirus serotype 1 (PEV-1) isolate was determined. The genome was found to contain a large open reading frame which encoded a leader protein prior to the capsid protein region. This showed no sequence identity to other picornavirus leader regions and the sequence data suggested that it does not possess proteolytic activity. The 2A protease was small and showed considerable sequence identity to the aphthoviruses and to equine rhinovirus serotype 2. The 2A/2B junction possessed the typical cleavage site (NPG/P) exhibited by these viruses. The other proteins shared less than 40% sequence identity with equivalent proteins from other picornavirus genera. Phylogenetic analyses of the P1 and 3D sequences indicated that this virus forms a distinct branch of the family <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>. On the basis of results presented in this paper PEV-1 has been assigned to a new picornavirus genus. The phylogeny of the virus in relation to other picornaviruses is discussed.</jats:p>,0
Functional characterization of a monoclonal antibody epitope using a lambda phage display-deep sequencing platform,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We have recently described a method, named PROFILER, for the identification of antigenic regions preferentially targeted by polyclonal antibody responses after vaccination. To test the ability of the technique to provide insights into the functional properties of monoclonal antibody (mAb) epitopes, we used here a well-characterized epitope of meningococcal factor H binding protein (fHbp), which is recognized by mAb 12C1. An fHbp library, engineered on a lambda phage vector enabling surface expression of polypeptides of widely different length, was subjected to massive parallel sequencing of the phage inserts after affinity selection with the 12C1 mAb. We detected dozens of unique antibody-selected sequences, the most enriched of which (designated as FrC) could largely recapitulate the ability of fHbp to bind mAb 12C1. Computational analysis of the cumulative enrichment of single amino acids in the antibody-selected fragments identified two overrepresented stretches of residues (H248-K254 and S140-G154), whose presence was subsequently found to be required for binding of FrC to mAb 12C1. Collectively, these results suggest that the PROFILER technology can rapidly and reliably identify, in the context of complex conformational epitopes, discrete “hot spots” with a crucial role in antigen-antibody interactions, thereby providing useful clues for the functional characterization of the epitope.</jats:p>",0

Evolutionary events of transmission and reassortment for influenza A viruses 
were traditionally detected by phylogenetic analysis for influenza viruses' 
eight gene segments. Because the phylogenetic analysis can be complex, we 
developed genotype profile method which packaged the phylogenetic algorithms to 
analyze combination patterns of gene segments and integrated epidemiology 
knowledge. With the method, the analysis of reassortment and transmission 
becomes a simple and reliable process that combines genotypes, which is 
identical for the biological process of the virus. An application called IVEE 
that implements the method is available for all academic users to apply the 
method http://snptransformer.sourceforge.net. Furthermore, we found that a 
previous summary of the reassortment events in swine influenza A viruses may be 
inaccurate.

Phylogenetic Diversity and Genotypical Complexity of H9N2 Influenza A Viruses Revealed by Genomic Sequence Analysis,"1. PLoS One. 2011 Feb 28;6(2):e17212. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0017212.

H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established worldwide in terrestrial 
poultry and wild birds, and are occasionally transmitted to mammals including 
humans and pigs. To comprehensively elucidate the genetic and evolutionary 
characteristics of H9N2 influenza viruses, we performed a large-scale sequence 
analysis of 571 viral genomes from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource Database, 
representing the spectrum of H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from 1966 to 2009. 
Our study provides a panoramic framework for better understanding the genesis 
and evolution of H9N2 influenza viruses, and for describing the history of H9N2 
viruses circulating in diverse hosts. Panorama phylogenetic analysis of the 
eight viral gene segments revealed the complexity and diversity of H9N2 
influenza viruses. The 571 H9N2 viral genomes were classified into 74 separate 
lineages, which had marked host and geographical differences in phylogeny. 
Panorama genotypical analysis also revealed that H9N2 viruses include at least 
98 genotypes, which were further divided according to their HA lineages into 
seven series (A-G). Phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes showed that H9N2 
viruses are closely related to H3, H4, H5, H7, H10, and H14 subtype influenza 
viruses. Our results indicate that H9N2 viruses have undergone extensive 
reassortments to generate multiple reassortants and genotypes, suggesting that 
the continued circulation of multiple genotypical H9N2 viruses throughout the 
world in diverse hosts has the potential to cause future influenza outbreaks in 
poultry and epidemics in humans. We propose a nomenclature system for 
identifying and unifying all lineages and genotypes of H9N2 influenza viruses in 
order to facilitate international communication on the evolution, ecology and 
epidemiology of H9N2 influenza viruses.

H9N2 influenza A viruses have become endemic in different types of terrestrial 
poultry and wild birds in Asia, and are occasionally transmitted to humans and 
pigs. To evaluate the role of black-billed magpies (Pica pica) in the evolution 
of influenza A virus, we conducted two epidemic surveys on avian influenza 
viruses in wild black-billed magpies in Guangxi, China in 2005 and characterized 
three isolated black-billed magpie H9N2 viruses (BbM viruses). Phylogenetic 
analysis indicated that three BbM viruses were almost identical with 99.7 to 
100% nucleotide homology in their whole genomes, and were reassortants 
containing BJ94-like (Ck/BJ/1/94) HA, NA, M, and NS genes, SH/F/98-like 
(Ck/SH/F/98) PB2, PA, and NP genes, and H5N1-like (Ck/YN/1252/03, clade 1) PB1 
genes. Genetic analysis showed that BbM viruses were most likely the result of 
multiple reassortments between co-circulating H9N2-like and H5N1-like viruses, 
and were genetically different from other H9N2 viruses because of the existence 
of H5N1-like PB1 genes. Genotypical analysis revealed that BbM viruses evolved 
from diverse sources and belonged to a novel genotype (B46) discovered in our 
recent study. Molecular analysis suggested that BbM viruses were likely low 
pathogenic reassortants. However, results of our pathogenicity study 
demonstrated that BbM viruses replicated efficiently in chickens and a mammalian 
mouse model but were not lethal for infected chickens and mice. Antigenic 
analysis showed that BbM viruses were antigenic heterologous with the H9N2 
vaccine strain. Our study is probably the first report to document and 
characterize H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from black-billed magpies in 
southern China. Our results suggest that black-billed magpies were susceptible 
to H9N2 influenza viruses, which raise concerns over possible transmissions of 
reassortant H9N2 viruses among poultry and wild birds.

BACKGROUND: Since the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza caused thousands of 
deaths of wild bird in this area in 2005, Qinghai Lake in China has become a hot 
spot for study of the influence of avian influenza to migratory wild birds. 
However, the ecology and evolution of low pathogenic avian influenza virus in 
this region are limited. This project-based avian influenza surveillance in 
Qinghai lake region was initiated in year 2012.
METHOD: Samples of wild bird feces and lake surface water were collected in 
Qinghai Lake in year 2012.Virus isolation was conducted on embryonated chicken 
eggs. The influenza A virus was determined by rRT-PCR. Virus sequences were 
acquired by deep sequencing. The phylogenetic correlation and molecular 
characteristics of the viruses were analyzed. The virus growth and infection 
features, receptor binding preference were studied, and pathogenicity in vitro 
as well as.
RESULTS: Two H13N8 subtype influenza viruses were isolated. The viruses are 
phylogenetically belong to Eurasian lineage. Most of the genes are associated 
with gull origin influenza virus except PB1 gene, which is most probably derived 
from Anseriformes virus. The evidence of interspecies reassortment was 
presented. The two viruses have limited growth capacity on MDCK and A549 cells 
while grow well in embryonated eggs. The dual receptor binding features of the 
two viruses was shown up. The low pathogenic features were determined by trypsin 
dependence plaque formation assay.
CONCLUSIONS: The two H13N8 subtype influenza viruses are highly associated with 
gull origin. The interspecies reassortment of H13 subtype virus among 
Anseriforme sand Charadriiformes wild birds emphasizes the importance of 
strengthening avian influenza surveillance in this region. This study is helpful 
to understand the ecology, evolution and transmission pattern of H13 subtype 
influenza virus globally.

An outbreak of a highly virulent pseudorabies virus strain, ZJ01, occurred in 
PRV-vaccinated pigs in China in 2011. In this study, ZJ01 caused fatal diseases, 
while the Chinese prototypic PRV strain LA caused mild respiratory disorders. 
Full-genome sequencing results indicate the two viruses can be classified into 
two sub-clusters that distinct from traditional European and US strains. To 
examine the potential role of the gE and gI proteins in ZJ01 virulence, we 
generated several recombinant viruses. In two chimeric viruses (rZJ01-LA/gEI and 
rLA-ZJ01/gEI), the gE and gI genes were swapped using corresponding genes from 
ZJ01 and LA. rZJ01-LA/gEI and the parental virus rZJ01 retained high virulence 
in piglets, although the survival time for rZJ01-LA/gEI infected piglets was 
obviously prolonged. In contrast, rLA-ZJ01/gEI exhibited higher virulence than 
its parental virus rLA. We conclude that changes in gE and gI proteins partly 
contribute to the enhanced virulence of ZJ01 strain.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most 
important swine diseases worldwide. In the present study, a new virulent strain 
of PRRS virus (PRRSV), GDsg, was isolated in Guangdong province, China, and 
caused high fever, high morbidity, and high mortality in sows and piglets. The 
genome of this new strain was 15,413 nucleotides (nt) long, and comparative 
analysis revealed that GDsg shared 82.4% to 94% identity with type 2 PRRSV 
strains, but only 61.5% identity with type 1 PRRSV Lelystad virus strain. 
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that type 2 PRRSV isolates include five 
subgenotypes (I, II, III, IV, and V), which are represented by NADC30, VR-2332, 
GM2, CH-1a, and HuN4, respectively. Moreover, GDsg belongs to a newly emerging 
type 2 PRRSV subgenotype III. More interestingly, the newly isolated GDsg strain 
has multiple discontinuous nt deletions, 131 (19 + 18 + 94) at position 
1404-1540 and a 107 nt insertion in the NSP2 region. Most importantly, the GDsg 
strain was identified as a virus recombined between low pathogenic field strain 
QYYZ and vaccine strain JXA1-P80. In conclusion, a new independent subgenotype 
and recombinant PRRSV strain has emerged in China and could be a new threat to 
the swine industry of China.

Subgroup J avian leukosis virus (ALV-J), a typical retrovirus, is characterized 
of existence of a cloud of diverse variants and considerable genetic diversity. 
Previous studies describing the evolutionary dynamics of ALV-J genetic variants 
mainly focused on the early infection period or few randomly selected clones. 
Here, we inoculated 30 specific-pathogen-free chickens with the same founder 
ALV-J stock of known genetic background. Six (three antibody positive and three 
antibody negative) chickens were selected among 15 chickens with viremia. 
Viruses were serially isolated in 36 weeks and then sequenced using MiSeq 
high-throughput sequencing platform. This produced the largest ALV-J dataset to 
date, composed of more than three million clean reads. Our results showed that 
host humoral immunity could greatly enhance the genetic diversity of ALV-J 
genetic variants. In particular, selection pressures promoted a dynamic 
proportional changes in ALV-J genetic variants frequency. Cross-neutralization 
experiment showed that along with the change of the dominant variant, the 
antibody titers specific to infectious clones corresponding to the most dominant 
variants in weeks 12 and 28 have also changed significantly in sera collected in 
weeks 16 and 32. In contrast, no shift of dominant variant was observed in 
antibody-negative chickens. Moreover, we identified a novel hypervariable region 
in the gp85 gene. Our study reveals the interaction between ALV-J and the host, 
which could facilitate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs.

The rotavirus non-structural protein NSP2 is one of the earliest and most 
abundant viral proteins produced during infection. This protein has multiple 
essential roles in the replication cycle involving RNA binding, viroplasm 
formation, helicase and can hydrolyse the γ-phosphate of RNA and NTPs acting as 
an RTPase and NTPase. In studying sequences from rotavirus strains isolated in 
Australia between 1984 and 2009, the NSP2 gene was seen to be highly conserved 
and clustered with defined NSP2 genotypes N1 and N2 according to the full genome 
based rotavirus classification system. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NSP2 
gene sequences isolated from Australian rotavirus strains formed four distinct 
lineages. Temporal variation was observed in several clusters during the 26 year 
period, with lineage D identified throughout the entire study period and lineage 
A only detected since 1999. Phylogenetic analysis and dendrograms identified 
NSP2 genes that exhibited reassortment between different virus VP7 genotypes, as 
well as a sequence from a human strain that grouped closely with the NSP2 genes 
of bovine rotavirus strains. This study also identified a sequence that fell 
between lineages and exhibited evidence of recombination, the first time that 
intergenic recombination has been detected in a NSP2 gene sequence. This study 
increases the understanding of the evolution mechanisms of NSP2 in view of 
improved vaccine design.

Rodents are distributed throughout the world and interact with humans in many 
ways. They provide vital ecosystem services, some species are useful models in 
biomedical research and some are held as pet animals. However, many rodent 
species can have adverse effects such as damage to crops and stored produce, and 
they are of health concern because of the transmission of pathogens to humans 
and livestock. The first rodent viruses were discovered by isolation approaches 
and resulted in break-through knowledge in immunology, molecular and cell 
biology, and cancer research. In addition to rodent-specific viruses, 
rodent-borne viruses are causing a large number of zoonotic diseases. Most 
prominent examples are reemerging outbreaks of human hemorrhagic fever disease 
cases caused by arena- and hantaviruses. In addition, rodents are reservoirs for 
vector-borne pathogens, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus and Borrelia spp., 
and may carry human pathogenic agents, but likely are not involved in their 
transmission to human. In our days, next-generation sequencing or 
high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is revolutionizing the speed of the discovery 
of novel viruses, but other molecular approaches, such as generic RT-PCR/PCR and 
rolling circle amplification techniques, contribute significantly to the rapidly 
ongoing process. However, the current knowledge still represents only the tip of 
the iceberg, when comparing the known human viruses to those known for rodents, 
the mammalian taxon with the largest species number. The diagnostic potential of 
HTS-based metagenomic approaches is illustrated by their use in the discovery 
and complete genome determination of novel borna- and adenoviruses as causative 
disease agents in squirrels. In conclusion, HTS, in combination with 
conventional RT-PCR/PCR-based approaches, resulted in a drastically increased 
knowledge of the diversity of rodent viruses. Future improvements of the used 
workflows, including bioinformatics analysis, will further enhance our knowledge 
and preparedness in case of the emergence of novel viruses. Classical 
virological and additional molecular approaches are needed for genome annotation 
and functional characterization of novel viruses, discovered by these 
technologies, and evaluation of their zoonotic potential.

The large virus family Paramyxoviridae includes some of the most significant 
human and livestock viruses, such as measles-, distemper-, mumps-, 
parainfluenza-, Newcastle disease-, respiratory syncytial virus and 
metapneumoviruses. Here we identify an estimated 66 new paramyxoviruses in a 
worldwide sample of 119 bat and rodent species (9,278 individuals). Major 
discoveries include evidence of an origin of Hendra- and Nipah virus in Africa, 
identification of a bat virus conspecific with the human mumps virus, detection 
of close relatives of respiratory syncytial virus, mouse pneumonia- and canine 
distemper virus in bats, as well as direct evidence of Sendai virus in rodents. 
Phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations suggests a predominance of host 
switches from bats to other mammals and birds. Hypothesis tests in a maximum 
likelihood framework permit the phylogenetic placement of bats as tentative 
hosts at ancestral nodes to both the major Paramyxoviridae subfamilies 
(Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae). Future attempts to predict the emergence of 
novel paramyxoviruses in humans and livestock will have to rely fundamentally on 
these data.

Bats Worldwide Carry Hepatitis E Virus-Related Viruses That Form a Putative Novel Genus within the Family Hepeviridae,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis in tropical and temperate climates. Tropical genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with food-borne and waterborne transmission. Zoonotic reservoirs (mainly pigs, wild boar, and deer) are considered for genotypes 3 and 4, which exist in temperate climates. In view of the association of several zoonotic viruses with bats, we analyzed 3,869 bat specimens from 85 different species and from five continents for hepevirus RNA. HEVs were detected in African, Central American, and European bats, forming a novel phylogenetic clade in the family<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepeviridae</jats:named-content>. Bat hepeviruses were highly diversified and comparable to human HEV in sequence variation. No evidence for the transmission of bat hepeviruses to humans was found in over 90,000 human blood donations and individual patient sera. Full-genome analysis of one representative virus confirmed formal classification within the family<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepeviridae</jats:named-content>. Sequence- and distance-based taxonomic evaluations suggested that bat hepeviruses constitute a distinct genus within the family<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepeviridae</jats:named-content>and that at least three other genera comprising human, rodent, and avian hepeviruses can be designated. This may imply that hepeviruses invaded mammalian hosts nonrecently and underwent speciation according to their host restrictions. Human HEV-related viruses in farmed and peridomestic animals might represent secondary acquisitions of human viruses, rather than animal precursors causally involved in the evolution of human HEV.</jats:p>",0

The full-length nucleotide sequence of the Chinese vaccine strain Asia1/YNBS/58 
of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was determined. The results showed that 
the complete genome of YNBS/58 is 8,164 nucleotides (nt) in length including a 
1,061-nt 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 6,990-nt open reading frame (ORF), and 
a 113-nt 3' UTR. Genome sequences of Asia1/YNBS/58 and other known FMDV strains 
were compared. The homology analysis indicated that non-structural proteins are 
more conserved than structural proteins in FMDV and that the 5' UTR is more 
conserved than the 3' UTR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Asia1/YNBS/58 is 
clustered in the Asia1 serotype and is linked to three other isolates, 
Asia1/IND/63/72, Asia1/3kimron/63, and Asia1/2ISRL/63, suggesting that they have 
a close genetic relationship. The VP1-, VP2-, and VP3-based phylogenetic trees 
divided into distinct clusters according to the different serotypes, while other 
gene-based phylogenetic trees exhibited some degree of intercrossing among 
serotypes. According to the nucleotide similarities between Asia1/YNBS/58 and 
two recent Chinese Asia1 isolates, Asia1/HKN/05, and Asia1/JS/05, each forms a 
distinct genotype. This study is the first description of the full-length 
genomic sequence of FMDV Chinese serotype Asia1.

Distribution and characteristics of rodent picornaviruses in China,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Rodents are important reservoir hosts of many important zoonotic viruses. The family Picornaviridae contains clinically important pathogens that infect humans and animals, and increasing numbers of rodent picornaviruses have recently been associated with zoonoses. We collected 574 pharyngeal and anal swab specimens from 287 rodents of 10 different species from eight representative regions of China from October 2013 to July 2015. Seven representative sequences identified from six rodent species were amplified as full genomes and classified into four lineages. Three lineage 1 viruses belonged to a novel genus of picornaviruses and was more closely related to Hepatovirus than to others genera of picornaviruses based on aa homology. Lineage 2, lineage 3, and lineage 4 viruses belonged to the genera Rosavirus, Hunnivirus, and Enterovirus, respectively, representing new species. According to both phylogenetic and identity analyses, Lineage 2 viruses had a close relationship with rosavirus 2 which was recovered from the feces of a child in Gambia and Lineage 3 viruses had a close relationship with domestic animal Hunnivirus. Lineage 4 viruses provide the first evidence of these enteroviruses and their evolution in rodent hosts in China.</jats:p>",0
Molecular Evolution and Emergence of H5N6 Avian Influenza Virus in Central China,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>H5N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) has posed a potential threat to public health since its emergence in China in 2013. To understand the evolution and emergence of H5N6 AIV in the avian population, we performed molecular surveillance of live poultry markets (LPMs) in Wugang Prefecture, Hunan Province, in central China, during 2014 and 2015. Wugang Prefecture is located on the Eastern Asian-Australian migratory bird flyway, and a human death due to an H5N6 virus was reported in the prefecture on 21 November 2016. In total, we sampled and sequenced the complete genomes of 175 H5N6 AIVs. Notably, our analysis revealed that H5N6 AIVs contain at least six genotypes arising from segment reassortment, including a rare variant that possesses an HA gene derived from H5N1 clade 2.3.2 and a novel NP gene that has its origins with H7N3 viruses. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that genetically similar H5N6 AIVs tend to cluster according to their geographic regions of origin. These results help to reveal the evolutionary behavior of influenza viruses prior to their emergence in humans.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            The newly emerged H5N6 influenza A virus has caused more than 10 human deaths in China since 2013. In November 2016, a human death due to an H5N6 virus, in Wugang Prefecture, Hunan Province, was confirmed by the WHO. To better understand the evolution and emergence of H5N6 viruses, we surveyed live poultry markets (LPMs) in Wugang Prefecture before the reported human death, with a focus on revealing the diversity and genomic origins of H5N6 in birds during 2014 and 2015. In general, H5N6 viruses in this region were most closely related to H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4, with the exception of one virus with an HA gene derived from clade 2.3.2 such that it represents a novel reassortant. Clearly, the ongoing surveillance of LPMs is central to monitoring the emergence of pathogenic influenza viruses.

Infection with the orf virus (ORFV) leads to contagious ecthyma, also called 
contagious pustular dermatitis, which usually affects sheep, goats and other 
small ruminants. It has a great distribution throughout the world and has also 
been reported to infect humans. Though many strains have been isolated from 
differing parts of mainland China, rarely has any strain been reported from the 
southern provinces of China. We studied a case of orf virus infection that 
occurred at Qingyuan City, Guangdong Province in southern China. An orf virus 
strain, GDQY, was successfully isolated and identified through cell culture 
techniques and transmission electron microscopy. Complete genes of ORFV011, 
ORFV059, ORFV106 and ORFV107 were amplified for the sequence analysis based on 
their nucleotide or amino acid level. In order to discuss the genetic variation, 
precise sequences were used to compare to other reference strains isolated from 
different districts or countries. Phylogenetic trees based on those strains were 
built up and evolutionary distances were calculated based on the alignment of 
their complete sequences. The typical structure of the orf virus was observed in 
cell-culture suspensions inoculated with GDQY, and the full-length of four genes 
was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that GDQY is 
homologous to FJ-DS and CQ/WZ on ORFV011 nucleotides. ORFV059 may be more 
variable than ORFV011 based on the comparison between GDQY and other isolates. 
Genetic studies of ORFV106 and 107 are reported for the first time in the 
presented study.

We characterized Influenza A/H5N1 virus that caused the first outbreak of highly 
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in chickens in Bhutan in 2010. The virus was 
highly virulent to chicken, killing them within two days of the experimental 
inoculation with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 2.88. For genetic 
and phylogenetic analyses, complete genome sequencing of 4 viral isolates was 
carried out. The isolates revealed multiple basic amino acids at their 
hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site, similar to other ""Qinghai-like"" H5N1 isolates. 
The receptor-binding site of HA molecule contained avian-like amino acids 
((222)Q and (224)G). The isolates also contained amino acid residue K at 
position 627 of the PB2 protein, and other markers in NS 1 and PB1 proteins, 
highlighting the risk to mammals. However, the isolates were sensitive to 
influenza drugs presently available in the market. The sequence analysis 
indicated that the Bhutan viruses shared 99.1-100% nucleotide homology in all 
the eight genes among themselves and 2010 chicken isolate from Bangladesh 
(A/chicken/Bangladesh/1151-11/2010) indicating common progenitor virus. The 
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Bhutan isolates belonged to sub-clade 
2.2.3 (EMA 3) and shared common progenitor virus with the 2010 Bangladesh virus. 
Based on the evidence of phylogeny and molecular markers, it could be concluded 
that the outbreaks in Bhutan and Bangladesh in 2010 were due to independent 
introductions of the virus probably through migratory birds.

Characterization of a new genotype and serotype of infectious bronchitis virus in Western Africa,"<jats:p>Between 2002 and 2007, more than 1000 chickens from commercial farms, live bird markets and backyard farms in Nigeria and Niger were tested for the presence of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genome. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences of the spike 1 (<jats:italic>S1</jats:italic>) gene revealed a new genotype of IBV that we refer to as ‘IBADAN’. The minimum genetic distance to the closest ‘non-IBADAN’ strains (UK/7/93 at the nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at the amino acid level) reached 24 and 32 % at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The full genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic distance of 9.7–16.4 % at the nucleotide level with all available fully sequenced strains. As IBV S1 plays a major role in antigenicity, the antigenic relatedness of NGA/A116E7/2006 was compared with strains of other serotypes. NGA/A116E7/2006 did not cross-react with antisera against IT02, M41, D274, Connecticut or 793/B strains in virus neutralization assays. NGA/A116E7/2006 cross-reacted with the QX-like strain ITA/90254/2005 but only to a low level (antigenic relatedness of 33 %), suggesting that IBADAN also represents a new serotype. A comparison of <jats:italic>S1</jats:italic> sequences identified several amino acids that may play a role in IBV antigenicity. Despite the absence of obvious clinical signs in poultry infected by IBADAN strains, it is important to test the cross-protection of current vaccine strains.</jats:p>",0

From August 2 to October 11, 2006, clusters of low pathogenicity (LP) North 
American lineage H5N1 and H7N3 avian influenza A viruses (AIV), and other 
subtypes, were recovered from free-flying, resident, wild mallards used as 
sentinels at one site. The antigenic subtypes, pathogenicity potential, and 
Sanger sequencing of the isolates determined the H5N1 and H7N3 isolates were 
only recovered from samples collected on 8/2/2006 and 9/8/2006, respectively. 
However, subsequent efforts using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and 
additional Sanger sequencing found partial H7 segments in other HA-NA virus 
combinations on 8/2/2006, 9/8/2006 and 10/11/2006. It is well established that 
over larger geographic areas and years AIVs form transient genomic 
constellations; this sequential sampling data revealed that over a short period 
of time the dynamics of AIVs can be active and newer sequencing platforms 
increase recognition of mixed infections. Both findings provide further insight 
into the natural history of AIVs in natural reservoirs.

Heparin is one of the main pharmaceutical products manufactured from raw animal 
material. In order to describe the viral burden associated with this raw 
material, we performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on mucus samples 
destined for heparin manufacturing, which were collected from European pigs. We 
identified Circoviridae and Parvoviridae members as the most prevalent 
contaminating viruses, together with viruses from the Picornaviridae, 
Astroviridae, Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Adenoviridae, Birnaviridae, and 
Anelloviridae families. Putative new viral species were also identified. The 
load of several known or novel small non-enveloped viruses, which are 
particularly difficult to inactivate or eliminate during heparin processing, was 
quantified by qPCR. Analysis of the combined HTS and specific qPCR results will 
influence the refining and validation of inactivation procedures, as well as 
aiding in risk analysis of viral heparin contamination.

Viral and bacterial pathogens are a significant economic concern to the US 
broiler industry and the ecological epicenter for poultry pathogens is the 
mixture of bedding material, chicken excrement and feathers that comprises the 
litter of a poultry house. This study used high-throughput sequencing to assess 
the richness and diversity of poultry litter bacterial communities, and to look 
for connections between these communities and the environmental characteristics 
of a poultry house including its history of gangrenous dermatitis (GD). Cluster 
analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed differences in the distribution of 
bacterial phylotypes between Wet and Dry litter samples and between houses. Wet 
litter contained greater diversity with 90% of total bacterial abundance 
occurring within the top 214 OTU clusters. In contrast, only 50 clusters 
accounted for 90% of Dry litter bacterial abundance. The sixth largest OTU 
cluster across all samples classified as an Arcobacter sp., an emerging human 
pathogen, occurring in only the Wet litter samples of a house with a modern 
evaporative cooling system. Ironically, the primary pathogenic clostridial and 
staphylococcal species associated with GD were not found in any house; however, 
there were thirteen 16S rRNA gene phylotypes of mostly gram-positive phyla that 
were unique to GD-affected houses and primarily occurred in Wet litter samples. 
Overall, the poultry house environment appeared to substantially impact the 
composition of litter bacterial communities and may play a key role in the 
emergence of food-borne pathogens.

Molecular and microscopic evidence of viruses in marine copepods,"<jats:p>
            As dominant members of marine mesozooplankton communities, copepods play critical roles in oceanic food webs and biogeochemical cycling. Despite the ecological significance of copepods, little is known regarding the causes of copepod mortality, and up to 35% of total copepod mortality cannot be accounted for by predation alone. Viruses have been established as ecologically important infectious agents in the oceans; however, viral infection has not been investigated in mesozooplankton communities.

BACKGROUND: Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) is a deltaretrovirus closely related to 
the Human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). Cattle are the natural host of BLV 
where it integrates into B-cells, producing a lifelong infection. Most infected 
animals remain asymptomatic but following a protracted latency period about 5 % 
develop an aggressive leukemia/lymphoma, mirroring the disease trajectory of 
HTLV-1. The mechanisms by which these viruses provoke cellular transformation 
remain opaque. In both viruses little or no transcription is observed from the 
5'LTR in tumors, however the proviruses are not transcriptionally silent. In the 
case of BLV a cluster of RNA polymerase III transcribed microRNAs are highly 
expressed, while the HTLV-1 antisense transcript HBZ is consistently found in 
all tumors examined.
RESULTS: Here, using RNA-seq, we demonstrate that the BLV provirus also 
constitutively expresses antisense transcripts in all leukemic and asymptomatic 
samples examined. The first transcript (AS1) can be alternately polyadenylated, 
generating a transcript of ~600 bp (AS1-S) and a less abundant transcript of 
~2200 bp (AS1-L). Alternative splicing creates a second transcript of ~400 bp 
(AS2). The coding potential of AS1-S/L is ambiguous, with a small open reading 
frame of 264 bp, however the transcripts are primarily retained in the nucleus, 
hinting at a lncRNA-like role. The AS1-L transcript overlaps the BLV microRNAs 
and using high throughput sequencing of RNA-ligase-mediated (RLM) 5'RACE, we 
show that the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) cleaves AS1-L. Furthermore, 
experiments using altered BLV proviruses with the microRNAs either deleted or 
inverted point to additional transcriptional interference between the two viral 
RNA species.
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of novel viral antisense transcripts shows the 
BLV provirus to be far from silent in tumors. Furthermore, the consistent 
expression of these transcripts in both leukemic and nonmalignant clones points 
to a vital role in the life cycle of the virus and its tumorigenic potential. 
Additionally, the cleavage of the AS1-L transcript by the BLV encoded microRNAs 
and the transcriptional interference between the two viral RNA species suggest a 
shared role in the regulation of BLV.

          <jats:p>
            The roles of disease and species hybridization in maintaining biodiversity are of wide interest, yet are rarely studied simultaneously in wild populations. Using genomic analysis of beak and feather disease virus in an avian ring-species complex,
            <jats:italic>Platycercus elegans</jats:italic>
            , to our knowledge we find viral phylogenetic structure analogous to Mayr’s ring-species hypothesis for the first time in any pathogen. Across 8 y, the host’s viral prevalence and infection load was lower in hybrid birds and in phenotypically intermediate subspecies. Viral genetic variation did not explain host prevalence or infection load, supporting conclusions that the evolved host response is more important. We show how host–species complexes and viral genomic analyses can provide insight into maintenance of biodiversity.

Parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3) is a common viral infection not only in humans, 
but also in many other species. Serological evidence suggests that nearly 100 % 
of children in the United States have been infected with PIV-3 by 5 years of 
age. Similarly, in cattle, PIV-3 is commonly associated with bovine respiratory 
disease complex. A novel dolphin PIV-3 (TtPIV-1) was described by Nollens et al. 
in 2008 from a dolphin that was diagnosed with an unknown respiratory illness. 
At that time, TtPIV-1 was found to be most similar to, but distinct from, bovine 
PIV-3 (BPIV-3). In the present study, similar viral growth kinetics and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCL8) production were seen between 
BPIV-3 and TtPIV-1 in BEAS-2B, MDBK, and Vero cell lines. Initial nomenclature 
of TtPIV-1 was based on partial sequence of the fusion and RNA polymerase genes. 
Based on the similarities we saw with the in vitro work, it was important to 
examine the TtPIV-1 genome in more detail. Full genome sequencing and subsequent 
phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six viral genes of TtPIV-1 clustered 
within the recently described BPIV-3 genotype B strains, and it is proposed that 
TtPIV-1 be re-classified with BPIV-3 genotype B strains.

Control measures for foot and mouth disease (FMD) in Nigeria have not been 
implemented due to the absence of locally produced vaccines and risk-based 
analysis resulting from insufficient data on the circulating FMD virus (FMDV) 
serotypes/strains. In 2013-2015, blood and epithelial samples were collected 
from reported FMD outbreaks in four states (Kaduna, Kwara, Plateau and Bauchi) 
in northern Nigeria. FMDV non-structural protein (NSP) seroprevalence for the 
outbreaks was estimated at 80% (72 of 90) and 70% (131 of 188) post-outbreak. 
Antibodies against FMDV serotypes O, A, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3 were detected across 
the states using solid-phase competitive ELISA. FMDV genome was detected in 99% 
(73 of 74) of the samples from FMD-affected animals using rRT-PCR, and 
cytopathic effect was found in cell culture by 59% (44 of 74) of these samples. 
Three FMDV serotypes O, A and SAT2 were isolated and characterized. The 
phylogenetic assessments of the virus isolates showed that two topotypes of FMDV 
serotype O, East Africa-3 (EA-3) and West Africa (WA) topotypes were 
circulating, as well as FMDV strains belonging to the Africa genotype (G-IV) of 
serotype A and FMDV SAT2 topotype VII strains. While the serotype O (EA-3) 
strains from Nigeria were most closely related to a 1999 virus strain from 
Sudan, the WA strain in Nigeria shares genetic relationship with three 1988 
viruses in Niger. The FMDV serotype A strains were closely related to a known 
virus from Cameroon, and the SAT2 strains were most closely related to virus 
subtypes in Libya. This study provides evidence of co-occurrence of FMDV 
serotypes and topotypes in West, Central, East and North Africa, and this has 
implication for control. The findings help filling the knowledge gap of FMDV 
dynamics in Nigeria and West Africa subregion to support local and regional 
development of vaccination-based control plans and international risk 
assessment.

Bovine herpesvirus type 2 is closely related to the primate alphaherpesviruses.

Bovine herpesvirus type 2 (BoHV-2), also known as bovine mammillitis virus, is 
classified in the Family Herpesviridae, Subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, and Genus 
Simplexvirus along with herpes simplex viruses type 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) 
and other primate simplexviruses on the basis of similarities in 4 genes within 
the 15 kb U(L) 23-29 cluster. This could be explained either by a global 
similarity or a recombination event that brought primate herpesviral sequences 
into a bovine virus. Our sequences for DNA polymerase (U(L)30), a large gene 
adjacent to the previously identified conserved cluster, and glycoprotein G 
(U(S)4), a gene as distant from the cluster as possible on the circularized 
genome, confirm the close relationship between BoHV-2 and the primate 
simplexviruses, and argue for a global similarity and probably a close 
evolutionary relationship. Thus one can speculate that BoHV-2 may represent a 
greater hazard to humans than has been appreciated previously.

BACKGROUND: H9N2 avian influenza viruses continue to spread in poultry and wild 
birds worldwide. Morocco just faced its first H9N2 influenza virus outbreaks 
early 2016 affecting different types of poultry production. After its 
introduction, the virus spread very rapidly throughout the country.
METHODS: Samples were collected from 11 chicken flocks with high morbidity and 
mortality rates. Four viruses were successfully isolated from broiler chickens 
and one from broiler breeders and fully sequenced.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic and molecular markers analyses showed the Moroccan viruses 
belonged to the G1 lineage and likely originated from the Middle East. As known 
for H9N2 viruses, the Moroccanisolates possess several genetic markers that 
enhance virulence in poultry and transmission to humans.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that under field conditions H9N2 
could have a devastating effect on egg production and mortalities and 
highlighted a lack of surveillance data on the pathogen in the region.

We report the first detection of a G6P[14] rotavirus strain in Egypt from the 
stool of a child participating in a hospital-based diarrhea surveillance study 
conducted throughout the year 2004. Rotavirus infection was initially detected 
using a rotavirus group A VP6 enzyme immunoassay; the P (VP4) and G (VP7) 
genotypes of the strain were identified by RT-PCR. We sequenced the VP7 gene and 
the VP8* portion of the VP4 gene and the strain displayed the strongest identity 
to the VP7 [>94% nucleotides (nt), >97% amino acids (aa)] and VP4 (>93% nt, >98% 
aa) sequences of PA169, a novel G6P[14] strain first isolated from a child in 
Italy during the winter of 1987. Additional sequencing and analysis of the other 
remaining structural (VP1-VP3, VP6) and non-structural (NSP1-NSP5) proteins 
support this animal-to-human reassortment theory. According to the full genome 
classification system, the G6P[14] strain (EGY3399) was assigned to 
G6-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3 genotypes. The greatest similarity of 
EGY3399 NSP4 and NSP5 gene sequences were to those of ovine and simian origin, 
respectively. Coupled with other observations, our results suggest G6P[14] 
isolates rarely cause severe diarrhea in Egyptian children, and support other 
studies that indicate animal rotavirus contribute to the genetic diversity of 
rotavirus detected from humans through interspecies transmission and single or 
multiple segments reassortment.

Avian influenza virus (AIV) is the causative agent of a zoonotic disease that 
affects populations worldwide with often devastating economic and health 
consequences. Most AIV subtypes cause little or no disease in waterfowl, but 
outbreaks in poultry can be associated with high mortality. Although 
transmission of AIV to humans occurs rarely and is strain dependent, the virus 
has the ability to mutate or reassort into a form that triggers a 
life-threatening infection. The constant emergence of new influenza strains 
makes it particularly challenging to predict the behavior, spread, virulence or 
potential for human-to-human transmission. Because it is difficult to anticipate 
which viral strain or what location will initiate the next pandemic, it is 
difficult to prepare for that event. However, rigorous implementation of 
biosecurity, vaccination and education programs can minimize the threat of AIV. 
Global surveillance programs help record and identify newly evolving and 
potentially pandemic strains harbored by the reservoir host.

The Ovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus F Gene Sequence and its Diagnostic Application,"<jats:p> Ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) are classified into 2 subgroups, ovine RSV and bovine RSV. Although ovine RSV infects cattle, its contribution to bovine respiratory tract disease has not been established, which is an important issue for vaccine development in cattle. Diagnosis by virus isolation or serology has low or variable sensitivity and/or specificity and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been recommended as a rapid and sensitive technique for RSV detection. A simple procedure has been developed to detect and identify bovine and ovine RSVs. First, the nucleotide sequence of the ovine RSV fusion (F) gene was determined and compared with representative strains of bovine RSV and human RSV subgroups A and B. The ovine RSV F gene has 85 and 72–73% nucleotide identity with those of bovine RSV and human RSV, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of the ovine RSV F gene has 94 and 83–84% amino acid identity with those of bovine RSV and human RSV, respectively. Then PCR primers targeting a specific F gene fragment of bovine and ovine RSV were designed. The primers represented bases 85–103 and the complementary sequence to bases 510–493 of the ovine RSV F gene. A similar PCR product (426 bp) was obtained on agarose gel electrophoresis from bovine RSV and from ovine RSV. The products, however, were unique to the parent virus and could be distinguished by EcoRI or MspI restriction endonuclease cleavage. EcoRI cleaved the ovine product into 2 bands (285 and 141 bp) but failed to affect the bovine RSV PCR product. However, MspI cleaved the bovine product into 2 bands (229 and 197 bp) but had no effect on the ovine product. Also, this assay did not amplify any PCR product with human RSV. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digestion is a useful and practical approach for detection and differentiation of ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses. </jats:p>",0

Host-origin classification and signatures of influenza A viruses were 
investigated based on the HA protein for tracking of the HA host of origin. 
Hidden Markov models (HMMs), decision trees and associative classification for 
each influenza A virus subtype and its major hosts (human, avian, swine) were 
generated. Features of the HA protein signatures that were host-and 
subtype-specific were sought. Host-associated signatures that occurred in 
different subtypes of the virus were identified. Evaluation of the 
classification models based on ROC curves and support and confidence ratings for 
the amino acid class-association rules was performed. Host classification based 
on the HA subtype achieved accuracies between 91.2% and 100% using decision 
trees after feature selection. Host-specific class association rules for 
avian-host origins gave better support and confidence ratings, followed by human 
and finally swine origin. This finding indicated the lower specificity of the 
swine host, perhaps pointing to its ability to mix different strains.

Rabies is caused by negative strand RNA-virus classified in the genus 
Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae of the order Mononegavirales. The aim of the 
present study was to identify and analyze nucleotides sequence of nucleoprotein 
(N) gene of rabies virus (RABV) from two cases of water buffaloes (Bubalus 
bubalis) bitten by a fox in Egypt, 2013. The diseased buffaloes showed nervous 
manifestations with fever. Specimens from brains of the buffaloes with suspected 
rabies were collected. RABV in collected samples was identified using direct 
fluorescent antibody (dFA) technique, histopathological examination and reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Also, nucleotides sequence of 
partially amplified nucleoprotein (N) gene was compared with the other street 
strains of RABV available on GenBank. The results revealed that RABV antigen was 
identified in the brains of diseased buffaloes by dFA technique and the 
characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusions (Negri bodies) and RABV nucleic acid 
were detected by histopathology and RT-PCR, respectively. The identified virus 
showed close genetic relationship with street strains identified previously from 
dogs in different Governorates in Egypt and with strains identified in Israel 
and Jordan indicating transmission of the virus between Egyptian Governorates 
with a potential transmission from and/or to our neighboring countries.

The genome of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) strains exhibiting a neuropathogenic 
potential compared to known BHV-1 strains by restriction site mapping and 
cross-hybridization.

Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) strains can be differentiated by their DNA and 
polypeptide patterns, and by antigenic properties as demonstrated by monoclonal 
antibodies. We classified the BHV-1 strains according to these data as BHV-1.1, 
BHV-1.2 (a/b) and BHV-1.3 (a/b). BHV-1.1 and BHV-1.2 correspond to the well 
known 'common' BHV-1 strains, whereas BHV-1.3 has only recently been recognized 
and exhibits a neuropathogenic potential. In the present paper we describe the 
structural genome characteristics of BHV-1.3 compared to those of the other 
BHV-1 strains, examined by means of restriction site mapping, electron 
microscopy and cross-hybridization. Our results also confirm and complete data 
concerning BHV-1.1 and BHV-1.2 published by other authors. The following main 
conclusions can be drawn from our investigations: BHV-1.1 and BHV-1.2 
differences are restricted to distinct genomic regions, characterized by loss or 
gain of restriction sites. BHV-1.3, however, differs from the other BHV-1 
strains in restriction site alterations throughout the whole genome. Electron 
microscopy showed the typical BHV-1 DNA structure for BHV-1.3. Genetic homology 
between BHV-1.1 and BHV-1.2, reported to be about 95%, was confirmed by 
cross-hybridization, and a similar high base sequence homology for BHV-1.3 could 
be shown.

Classical swine fever (CSF), a highly contagious viral disease affecting 
domestic and wild pigs in many developing countries, is now considered endemic 
in Mongolia, with 14 recent outbreaks in 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015. 
For the first time, CSF viruses isolated from these 14 outbreaks were analyzed 
to assess their molecular epidemiology and pathogenicity in pigs. Based on the 
nucleotide sequences of their 5'-untranslated region, isolates were 
phylogenetically classified as either sub-genotypes 2.1b or 2.2, and the 2014 
and 2015 isolates, which were classified as 2.1b, were closely related to 
isolates from China and Korea. In addition, at least three different viruses 
classified as 2.1b circulated in Mongolia. Experimental infection of the 
representative isolate in 2014 demonstrated moderate pathogenicity in 4-week-old 
pigs, with relatively mild clinical signs. Understanding the diversity of

Viral discovery as a tool for pandemic preparedness.

Epstein JH, Anthony SJ.

Emerging diseases are frequently caused by novel or previously unrecognised 
zoonotic viral pathogens, which tend to originate in and emerge from wildlife. 
When human or animal cases are first recognised, molecular or serological 
diagnostic assays specific to them do not yet exist, causing a delay in the 
identification of an outbreak's aetiologic agent as well as its source. 
Preparing for the next virus to emerge is a major public health challenge, 
impeded by a poor understanding of the diversity of potential candidates that 
exist in wildlife reservoirs. Characterising the diversity of viruses in key 
wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response in 
an outbreak situation, and inform public health strategies that reduce the risk 
of spillover from animal reservoirs. Pathogen discovery techniques such as 
consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
have been used to identify known and novel viruses in animals and humans, but 
have not been widely used in surveillance programmes. Metagenomic studies have 
identified novel viruses, new strains of known viruses, and have characterised 
host microbiomes. While NGS represents an unbiased approach to viral sequence 
detection, it is constrained by lower sensitivity than conventional PCR, 
requires substantial bioinformatics capabilities, and is cost prohibitive and 
therefore not widely available in the regions of the world that are most 
vulnerable to zoonotic disease emergence. In contrast, consensus PCR uses 
standard and widely available technologies, has greater sensitivity than NGS, 
and has also been used to identify novel viruses in wildlife, livestock and 
humans, though it is limited to detecting target genetic sequences conserved 
across known groups of viruses. The use of cPCR, in combination, if possible, 
with NGS and serology, can offer a powerful approach to rapidly identifying 
aetiologic agents in an outbreak and characterising the virome of key wildlife 
known to carry zoonotic viruses. Here, the authors review pathogen discovery 
techniques currently being used in human and animal surveillance programmes and 
the challenges of using viral discovery to identify novel zoonotic pathogens.

Publisher: Les maladies émergentes sont souvent causées par des virus nouveaux 
ou précédemment inconnus, de portée zoonotique, qui ont généralement leur source 
dans la faune sauvage, à partir de laquelle s’effectue leur émergence. Lorsque 
le premier cas d’infection par un virus de ce type est détecté chez l’homme ou 
chez les animaux, il n’existe encore aucune épreuve moléculaire ou sérologique 
de détection de l’agent étiologique, ce qui retarde son identification ainsi que 
l’élucidation de la source du foyer. La préparation aux futures émergences 
virales est un véritable défi de santé publique et se voit entravée par les 
lacunes des connaissances sur la diversité des virus potentiellement candidats. 
La caractérisation des différents virus qui affectent les principales espèces 
sauvages permettra de réduire le délai entre le moment où un nouveau foyer est 
détecté et celui où une réponse lui est apportée, et d’élaborer en connaissance 
de cause des stratégies de santé publique visant à limiter le risque d’un 
franchissement d’espèce à partir des réservoirs animaux. Les techniques de 
découverte d’agents pathogènes, par exemple l’amplification en chaîne par 
polymérase (PCR) pan-générique ou consensus et le séquençage de nouvelle 
génération (SNG) sont utilisées pour identifier des virus connus ou nouveaux 
chez l’homme et l’animal, mais ne sont pas d’une utilisation courante dans les 
programmes de surveillance. Les études métagénomiques permettent d’identifier 
des virus nouveaux ainsi que les souches nouvelles de virus connus et servent 
également à caractériser le microbiome de l’hôte. Le SNG constitue une méthode 
de détection des séquences virales exempte de biais mais sa sensibilité moindre 
que celle des PCR classiques, les capacités bio-informatiques considérables 
qu’il requiert et son coût prohibitif sont des contraintes importantes qui en 
limitent l’utilisation dans les régions du monde les plus vulnérables à 
l’émergence des maladies zoonotiques. En revanche, la PCR consensus fait appel à 
des technologies normalisées et largement disponibles, tout en présentant une 
meilleure sensibilité que le SNG ; elle permet également d’identifier des virus 
nouveaux présents dans la faune sauvage, chez les animaux domestiques ou chez 
l’homme, bien qu’elle ne détecte que des séquences génétiques cibles conservées 
d’un groupe connu de virus à l’autre. Le recours à la PCR consensus, si possible 
associé aux techniques de SNG et à la sérologie se révèle une stratégie 
puissante qui permet d’identifier rapidement les agents responsables d’un foyer 
et de caractériser le virome d’espèces sauvages jouant un rôle majeur en tant 
que réservoirs de virus zoonotiques. Après avoir passé en revue les techniques 
de découverte d’agents pathogènes actuellement utilisées dans les programmes de 
surveillance des maladies animales et humaines, les auteurs font le point sur 
les enjeux de ces techniques pour l’identification de nouveaux agents pathogènes 
zoonotiques.

Publisher: La causa de las enfermedades emergentes reside muchas veces en virus 
zoonóticos de aparición reciente o hasta entonces no descritos, que en general 
se originan y surgen en animales salvajes. Cuando se detectan los primeros casos 
en personas o animales aún no existen pruebas específicas de diagnóstico, ya sea 
molecular o serológico, y ello retrasa la identificación del agente etiológico 
del brote y la determinación de su origen. Prepararse para el próximo virus que 
vaya a aparecer es un gran objetivo de salud pública, lastrado en la práctica 
por el escaso conocimiento de la gran diversidad de posibles candidatos que 
moran en los reservorios de la fauna salvaje. La caracterización de los diversos 
virus que existen en las principales especies de animales salvajes ayudará a 
reducir el lapso que media entre la detección y la respuesta en caso de brote y 
a fundamentar a partir de ahí estrategias de salud pública que reduzcan el 
riesgo de diseminación desde los reservorios animales. Hasta ahora las técnicas 
de descubrimiento de patógenos, como la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa 
(PCR) de consenso (PCRc) o la secuenciación de próxima generación, han servido 
para identificar virus nuevos o ya conocidos en personas y animales, pero no se 
han aplicado de forma generalizada a los programas de vigilancia. Gracias a 
estudios de metagenómica se han podido detectar virus recién aparecidos o nuevas 
cepas de virus ya conocidos y caracterizar los microbiomas de los organismos 
anfitriones. Aunque la secuenciación de próxima generación constituye un método 
exento de sesgos para detectar secuencias víricas, adolece de una menor 
sensibilidad que la PCR convencional, exige una considerable capacidad de 
gestión informática de datos biológicos y tiene un costo prohibitivo, por lo que 
no suele aplicarse en las regiones del mundo que están más expuestas a la 
aparición de enfermedades zoonóticas. La PCR de consenso, en cambio, reposa en 
técnicas habituales y muy extendidas, ofrece mayor sensibilidad que la 
secuenciación de próxima generación y también ha sido utilizada para identificar 
virus nuevos en personas o animales salvajes y domésticos, si bien solo permite 
detectar las secuencias genéticas «diana» conservadas de entre todos los grupos 
conocidos de virus. El uso de la PCRc, combinado con la secuenciación de próxima 
generación y técnicas serológicas cuando sea posible, puede ofrecer un potente 
método para identificar con rapidez los agentes etiológicos de un brote y 
caracterizar el viroma de los principales animales salvajes de los que se sabe 
que son portadores de virus zoonóticos. Los autores pasan revista a las técnicas 
de descubrimiento de patógenos que se utilizan actualmente en los programas de 
vigilancia sanitaria y zoosanitaria y exponen las dificultades que presenta el 
uso del descubrimiento de virus para identificar nuevos patógenos zoonóticos.

Vampire bats are the only mammals known to feed exclusively on blood from other 
animals, often from domestic cattle. We tested the hypothesis that the 
adaptation of vampire bats to hematophagy would have resulted in shared viral 
communities among vampire bats and cattle, as a direct result of historic 
spillover events occurring due to hematophagy. We analyzed the presence of 
different viruses in sample populations of sympatric bat and prey populations 
and searched for shared viruses between taxa. A limited number of DNA viral 
groups were detected within each species. However, there was no evidence for a 
shared viral community among the vampire bat and cattle populations tested.

Large deletions in the 5′-untranslated region of foot-and-mouth disease virus of serotype C,"1. Virus Res. 1995 Feb;35(2):155-67. doi: 10.1016/0168-1702(94)00091-p.

Madrid, Spain.

Nucleotide sequences of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), at the 3'-side of 
the poly C tract, have been compared for 21 isolates of foot-and-mouth disease 
virus (FMDV) of serotype C from Europe, South America and The Philippines. A 
deletion of 43 nucleotides is present in the European isolates as compared with 
most American isolates. A larger deletion of 86 nucleotides is present in some 
viruses from South America and The Philippines. These deletions include the loss 
of one or two pseudoknot structures predicted in this region of the 5'-UTR. In 
addition, multiple point mutations have allowed the derivation of a phylogenetic 
tree which defines a grouping of isolates very similar to that derived from the 
capsid gene sequences of the same viruses. The study provides evidence that 
deletion (or addition) events must be very frequent during evolution of FMDV 
type C, since viruses which are phylogenetically very closely related (they 
belong to the same tree branch) may differ in the presence or absence of these 
deletions. Implications for FMDV evolution are discussed.

Impact of antigenic and genetic drift on the serologic surveillance of H5N2 avian influenza viruses,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Serologic surveillance of Avian Influenza (AI) viruses is carried out by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test using reference reagents. This method is recommended by animal health organizations as a standard test to detect antigenic differences (subtypes) between circulating influenza virus, vaccine- and/or reference- strains. However, significant discrepancies between reference antisera and field isolates have been observed during serosurveillance of influenza A viruses in pig and poultry farms. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of influenza virus genetic and antigenic drift on serologic testing using standard HI assays and reference reagents. Low pathogenic AI H5N2 viruses isolated in Mexico between 1994 and 2008 were used for phylogenetic analysis of AI hemagglutinin genes and for serologic testing using antisera produced with year-specific AI virus isolates.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant divergence between early LPAI H5N2 viruses (1994 - 1998) and more recent virus field isolates (2002 - 2008). Results of the HI test were markedly influenced by the selection of the AI H5N2 virus (year of isolation) used as reference antigen for the assay. These analyses indicate that LPAI H5N2 viruses in Mexico are constantly undergoing genetic drift and that serosurveillance of AI viruses is significantly influenced by the antigen or antisera used for the HI test.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Reference viral antigens and/or antisera need to be replaced constantly during surveillance of AI viruses to keep pace with the AI antigenic drift. This strategy should improve the estimation of antigenic differences between circulating AI viruses and the selection of suitable vaccine strains.</jats:p>

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is believed to be the cause of fatal poultry 
disease worldwide. The fusion (F) protein plays a key role in virus 
pathogenesis, and it is also used for Newcastle disease virus classification. In 
this study, we determined the complete coding sequence of the F gene in new 
velogenic NDV isolates with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 1.8 and 
a mean death time (MDT) of 72 or 48 h. Complete sequences of the F genes of new 
Iranian isolates were amplified and sequenced in both directions. These isolates 
were compared to 195 nucleotide sequences from GenBank (available as of 
07/17/2016). A phylogenetic tree was constructed for the F gene, using MEGA6 
software with statistical analysis based on 500 bootstrap replicates. 
Evolutionary distances revealed that the new virulent isolates from Iran 
belonged to genotype VII in a new distinct sub-genotype named VII-(j). This new 
sub-genotype showed 3% divergence from genotype VIId. Recombination analysis 
showed that these new isolates were not recombinant NDVs.

Poxviruses compromise a group of long known important pathogens including some 
zoonotic members affecting lifestock animals and humans. While whole genome 
sequence analysis started to shed light into the molecular mechanisms underlying 
host cell infection, viral replication as well as virulence, our understanding 
of poxvirus maintenance in nature and their transmission to humans is still 
poor. During the last two decades, reports on emerging human monkeypox outbreaks 
in Africa and North America, the increasing number of cowpox virus infections in 
cats, exotic animals and humans and cases of vaccinia virus infections in humans 
in South America and India reminded us that - beside the eradicated smallpox 
virus - there are other poxviruses that can cause harm to men. We start to learn 
that the host range of some poxviruses is way broader than initially thought and 
that mainly rodents seem to function as virus reservoir. The following review is 
aiming to provide an up-to-date overview on the epidemiology of zoonotic 
poxviruses, emphasizing orthopoxviruses. By outlining the current knowledge of 
poxvirus transmission, we hope to raise the awareness about modes of acquisition 
of infections and their proper diagnosis.

Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a transboundary viral disease of small 
ruminants that causes huge economic losses in Africa, The Middle East and Asia. 
In Morocco, the first PPR outbreak was notified in 2008. Since then no cases 
were reported for seven years, probably due to three successive vaccination 
campaigns during 2008-2011 and close surveillance at the border areas. In June 
2015, the disease re-emerged in Morocco, raising questions about the origin of 
the virus. The PPR virus was confirmed by qRT-PCR and virus was isolated from 
clinical samples on VeroNectin-4 cells. The disease was experimentally 
reproduced in Alpine goats using both sheep and goat derived outbreak isolates. 
Molecular characterization of the 2015 Moroccan PPR isolate confirmed the 
identity of the virus as lineage IV, closely related to the 2012 Algerian 
(KP793696) and 2012 Tunisian (KM068121) isolates and significantly distinct from 
the previous PPRV Morocco 2008 strain (HQ131927). Therefore this study confirms 
a new incursion of PPR virus in Morocco during 2015 and highlights the urgency 
of implementation of a common control strategy to combat PPR in Maghreb region 
in North Africa.

The genetic characteristics, of 38 field isolates of bovine viral diarrhoea 
virus (BVDV) collected in 1999 from sick or healthy and persistently infected 
cattle of dairy farms situated in northern Italy, were investigated. A partial 
5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) sequence of each isolate was determined and a 
phylogenetic analysis was performed. All the isolates were classified as 
belonging to the BVDV-1 genotype and could be assigned to different BVDV-1 
groups, namely BVDV-1b (n = 20), BVDV-1d (n = 6) and BVDV-1e (n = 10). Two 
remaining isolates could be classified as BVDV-1f and BVDV-1h, respectively. 
These results provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity of BVDV in Italy, and 
contribute to a better knowledge of the circulation of BVDV strains, and to 
their classification.

Outbreaks of pseudorabies (PR) have occurred in southern China since late 2011, 
resulting in significant economic impacts on the swine industry. To identify the 
cause of PR outbreaks, especially among vaccinated pigs, 11 pseudorabies virus 
(PRV) field strains were isolated from Guangdong province during 2013-2014. 
Their major viral genes (gE, TK, gI, PK, gD, 11K, and 28K) were analyzed in this 
study. Insertions or deletions were observed in gD, gE, gI and PK genes compared 
with other PRV isolates from all over the world. Furthermore, sequence alignment 
showed that insertions in gD and gE were unique molecular characteristics of the 
new prevalent PRV strains in China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that our 
isolates were clustered in an independent branch together with other strains 
isolated from China in recent years, and that they showed a closer genetic 
relationship with earlier isolates from Asia. Our results suggest that these 
isolates are novel PRV variants with unique molecular signatures.

"Identification and Characterization of Porcine Kobuvirus Variant Isolated from Suckling Piglet in Gansu Province, China","<jats:p>Kobuviruses comprise three species, the Aichivirus A, Aichivirus B, and Aichivirus C (porcine kobuvirus). Porcine kobuvirus is endemic to pig farms and is not restricted geographically but, rather, is distributed worldwide. The complete genomic sequences of four porcine kobuvirus strains isolated during a diarrhea outbreak in piglets in the Gansu province of China were determined. Two of these strains exhibited variations relative to the traditional strains. The potential 3C/3D cleavage sites of the variant strains were Q/C, which differed from the Q/S in the traditional porcine kobuvirus genome. A  90-nucleotide deletion in the 2B protein and a single nucleotide insertion in the 3′UTR were found in the variant strains. The VP1 regions of all four porcine kobuviruses in our study were highly variable (81%–86%). Ten common amino acid mutations were found specifically at certain positions within the VP1 region. Significant recombination sites were identified using SimPlot scans of whole genome sequences. Porcine kobuviruses were also detected in pig serum, indicating that the virus can escape the gastrointestinal tract and travel to the circulatory system. These findings suggest that mutations and recombination events may have contributed to the high level of genetic diversity of porcine kobuviruses and serve as a driving force in its evolution.</jats:p>",0
Extraneous agent detection in vaccines − A review of technical aspects,"1. Biologicals. 2012 Jul;40(4):225-30. doi: 10.1016/j.biologicals.2012.04.004.

Extraneous agent detection in vaccines--a review of technical aspects.

Products, Budapest, Hungary. farsanga@oai.hu

The quality and safety of commercial vaccines have a profound importance. 
Contrary to all precautions and efforts the use of biological material in 
vaccine development and production may lead to potential contamination of the 
vaccines with known and unknown extraneous agents (EAs). In veterinary field 
official lists of EAs have been compiled as legal framework to describe the 
potential agents, which must be tested during manufacture of vaccines. 
Nevertheless, detection of known and unknown contaminants in vaccines is a 
common duty for manufacturers and authorities of both veterinary and human field 
sharing similar needs of special technical approaches. State-of-art molecular 
methods such as randomly primed PCR combined with massive parallel sequencing 
(MPS) or microarrays may open new perspectives in extraneous agent testing. The 
robustness and efficacy of this technical approach in vaccine control was 
clearly demonstrated on a human vaccine example when porcine circovirus type 1 
(PCV1) contamination was revealed in Rotarix, a human rotavirus vaccine. The 
consequences and implications are reviewed hereby from a veterinary regulatory 
point of view.

The recently described novel gyroviruses may infect chickens and/or humans; 
however, their pathogenic potential is unknown. In our metagenomic 
investigation, we detected many of the novel gyroviruses in the fecal viromes of 
ferrets with lymph node and organ enlargement. The complete genomic sequences of 
selected gyrovirus strains showed 90.7-99.4 % similarity to homologous reference 
gyrovirus strains. This study did not demonstrate an association between 
gyrovirus shedding from ferrets and the observed background disease; however, it 
provides evidence for genetic diversity among gyroviruses and raises the 
possibility that pet ferrets may transmit gyroviruses to heterologous hosts, 
e.g., humans.

In a recent study, an emerging infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) genotype 
(ITA) was detected in IBDV-live vaccinated broilers without clinical signs of 
infectious bursal disease (IBD). VP2 sequence analysis showed that strains of 
the ITA genotype clustered separately from vaccine strains and from other IBDV 
reference strains, either classic or very virulent. In order to obtain a more 
exhaustive molecular characterization of the IBDV ITA genotype and speculate on 
its origin, genome sequencing of the field isolate IBDV/Italy/1829/2011, 
previously assigned to the ITA genotype, was performed, and the sequences 
obtained were compared to the currently available corresponding sequences. In 
addition, phylogenetic and recombination analyses were performed. Interestingly, 
multiple amino acid (AA) sequence alignments revealed that the 
IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 strain shared several AA residues with very virulent IBDV 
strains as well as some virulence markers, especially in the VP1 protein. 
Nevertheless, sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of several residues 
typical of IBDV strains at a low degree of virulence in the IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 
strain. Although homologous recombination and reassortant phenomena may occur 
naturally among different IBDV strains, no evidence of those events was found in 
the genome of the IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 strain, which was confirmed to be a 
genetically distinctive IBDV genotype.

Oral vaccination against classical swine fever (CSF) is a potent tool to control 
disease outbreaks in wild boar. So far, vaccination campaigns have been carried 
out using live attenuated vaccines that do not allow serological differentiation 
of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Although this drawback is acceptable 
for wild boar, the use of marker vaccines would facilitate studies on disease 
and vaccination dynamics. Recently, the CSF marker vaccine candidate CP7_E2alf 
was assessed for oral immunization under laboratory conditions. Promising 
results prompted efforts to study the vaccine candidate under field conditions 
and in bait formulation. In this context, two oral vaccination campaigns were 
carried out with CP7_E2alf bait vaccines in two areas called 'faunistic-hunting 
farms' in the region of Umbria, Italy. One campaign was conducted using single 
vaccination, the second with the routinely employed double vaccination strategy. 
Both campaigns were carried out before concerted hunting actions were performed. 
Bait uptake, vaccine virus detection and antibody responses were assessed along 
with inspections upon gutting. As a comparator, seven wild boar were hand-fed 
with baits under laboratory conditions. In the field, bait uptake ranged from 
63.7% to 98.7%, whereas antibody prevalence reached only 33.3-35.1%. The marker 
serology showed a strong influence of sample quality on the test outcome with a 
total of 85% of samples being classified correctly. Vaccine virus was not 
detectable. Under hand feeding conditions, six out of seven wild boar took up at 
least one bait, and five of them showed detectable antibody levels seven weeks 
after vaccination. These results were supplemented by stability tests. 
Appropriate stability of vaccine virus was shown both under field and laboratory 
conditions. In total, most results were in line with our expectations. However, 
optimization of the DIVA assay has to be attempted in the future.

BACKGROUND: Duck Enteritis Virus (DEV), belonging to the α-herpesvirus 
subfamily, is a linear double-stranded DNA virus. Glycoprotein H and L (gH and 
gL), encoded by UL22 and UL1, are conserved in the family of herpesviruses. They 
play important roles as gH/gL dimers during viral entry into host cells through 
cell-cell fusion. The interaction between gH and gL has been confirmed in 
several human herpesviruses, such as Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) and Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV). In this paper, we studied the 
interaction between DEV gH and gL.
RESULTS: Recombinant plasmids pEGFP-N-gH and pDsRED-N-gL were constructed 
successfully. Expressions of both DEV gH and gL were observed after incubation 
of COS-7 cells transfected with pEGFP-N-gH and pDsRED-N-gL plasmids after 12 h, 
respectively. Also, the co-localization of a proportion of the gH and gL was 
detected in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells after co-transfection for 24 h. Then, 
pCMV-Flag-gL and pCMV-Myc-gH recombinant plasmids were constructed and 
co-transfected into COS-7 cells. It was showed that both gH and gL were tested 
with positive results through co-immunoprecipitation and Western-blotting.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated not only the co-localization of DEV gH and 
gL in COS-7 cells, but also the interaction between them. It will provide an 
insight for the further studies in terms of protein-protein interaction in DEV.

Sixty-two strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from 
diseased chickens at different farms in southern China during 2011-2012, and 
66.1 % of the isolated strains were associated with typical nephritis. Analysis 
of the S1 gene sequences amplified from the 62 isolated strains together with 40 
reference strains published in Genbank showed nucleotide homologies ranging from 
63.5 to 99.9 % and amino acid homologies ranging from 57.9 to 100 %. 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Chinese IBV strains were clustered into 
six distinct genetic groups (I-VI). Most of the isolated strains belonged to 
group I, and the isolation of group V strains was increased compared with an 
earlier period of surveillance. Current vaccine strains used in China (H120, 
H52, W93, and Ma5) formed the group Mass which is evolutionarily distant from 
Chinese isolates. Alignment of S1 amino acid sequences revealed polymorphic and 
diverse substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and the S1 protein of major 
pandemic strains contained 540 amino acids with a cleavage site sequence of 
HRRRR or RRF(L/S)RR. Further analysis showed that recombination events formed a 
new subgroup. Taken together, these findings suggest that various IBV variants 
were co-circulating and undergoing genetic evolution in southern China during 
the observation period. Therefore, long-term continuing surveillance is 
significantly important for prevention and control of IBV infection.

The family Picornaviridae comprises of small, non-enveloped, positive-strand RNA 
viruses and contains many human and animal pathogens including enteroviruses 
(e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71 and rhinovirus), cardioviruses 
(e.g. encephalomyocarditis virus), hepatitis A virus and foot-and-mouth disease 
virus. Picornavirus infections activate a cytosolic RNA sensor, MDA5, which in 
turn, induces a type I interferon response, a crucial component of antiviral 
immunity. Moreover, picornaviruses activate the formation of stress granules 
(SGs), large aggregates of preassembled mRNPs (messenger ribonucleoprotein 
particles) to temporarily store these molecules upon cellular stress. Meanwhile, 
picornaviruses actively suppress these antiviral responses to ensure efficient 
replication. In this review we provide an overview of the induction and 
suppression of the MDA5-mediated IFN-α/β response and the cellular stress 
pathway by picornaviruses.

"A novel recombinant lineage’s contribution to the outbreak of coxsackievirus A6-associated hand, foot and mouth disease in Shanghai, China, 2012-2013","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Since late 2012, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) has gradually become the predominant pathogen responsible for hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in several provinces of China. A total of 626 patients diagnosed with HFMD in Shanghai, China from January 2012 to September 2013 were enrolled in this study. Of these, 292 CVA6 infected cases were subjected to clinical analyses. Whole-genome sequencing, recombination and phylogenetic analyses were also performed. A recombinant CVA6 monophyletic lineage was found during an outbreak of CVA6-associated HFMDs in Shanghai, China in November 2012 and accounted for 21.9% (64/292) of the CVA6 strains during the study period. Recombination analyses showed that the 2C gene of the novel CVA6 virus was probably derived from a coxsackievirus A4 (CVA4) strain circulating in the population. Clinical observation showed that this recombinant CVA6 virus led to a more generalized rash than did the non-recombinant CVA6 virus. This newly emerged CVA6 lineage was associated with a considerable proportion of HFMD cases from 2012 to 2013 in Shanghai and poses a potential threat to public health.</jats:p>",0
Disease outbreaks caused by steppe-type rabies viruses in China,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>While rabies is a significant public health concern in China, the epidemiology of animal rabies in the north and northwest border provinces remains unknown. From February 2013 to March 2014, seven outbreaks of domestic animal rabies caused by wild carnivores in Xinjiang (XJ) and Inner Mongolia (IM) Autonomous Regions, China were reported and diagnosed in brain samples of infected animals by the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and RT–PCR. Ten field rabies viruses were obtained. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis based on the complete<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>gene (1353 bp) amplified directly from the original brain tissues showed that these ten strains were steppe-type viruses, closely related to strains reported in Russia and Mongolia. None had been identified previously in China. The viruses from XJ and IM clustered separately into two lineages showing their different geographical distribution. This study emphasizes the importance of wildlife surveillance and of cross-departmental cooperation in the control of transboundary rabies transmission.</jats:p>",0

monitoring wild birds in Kazakhstan in 2013 and each was further characterized. 
The viruses were isolated from three White-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), one 
Whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus), and one Little stint (Calidris minuta). Before our 
study, only two complete APMV-8 sequences had been reported worldwide since 
their discovery in the USA and Japan in the 1970s. We report the complete genome 
sequences of the newly detected viruses and analyze the genetic evolution of the 
APMV-8 viruses over four decades.

Pathogenesis of Influenza D Virus in Cattle,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>

            Cattle have been proposed as the natural reservoir of a novel member of the virus family
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Orthomyxoviridae</jats:named-content>
            , which has been tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV). Although isolated from sick animals, it is unclear whether IDV causes any clinical disease in cattle. To address this aspect of Koch's postulates, three dairy calves (treatment animals) held in individual pens were inoculated intranasally with IDV strain D/bovine/Mississippi/C00046N/2014. At 1 day postinoculation, a seronegative calf (contact animal) was added to each of the treatment animal pens. The cattle in both treatment and contact groups seroconverted, and virus was detected in their respiratory tracts. Histologically, there was a significant increase in neutrophil tracking in tracheal epithelia of the treatment calves compared to control animals. While infected and contact animals demonstrated various symptoms of respiratory tract infection, they were mild, and the calves in the treatment group did not differ from the controls in terms of heart rate, respiratory rate, or rectal temperature. To mimic zoonotic transmission, two ferrets were exposed to a plastic toy fomite soaked with infected nasal discharge from the treatment calves. These ferrets did not shed the virus or seroconvert. In summary, this study demonstrates that IDV causes a mild respiratory disease upon experimental infection of cattle and can be transmitted effectively among cattle by in-pen contact, but not from cattle to ferrets through fomite exposure. These findings support the hypothesis that cattle are a natural reservoir for the virus.

            A novel influenza virus, tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV), was identified in swine, cattle, sheep, and goats. Among these hosts, cattle have been proposed as the natural reservoir. In this study, we show that cattle experimentally infected with IDV can shed virus and transmit it to other cattle through direct contact, but not to ferrets through fomite routes. IDV caused minor clinical signs in the infected cattle, fulfilling another of Koch's postulates for this novel agent, although other objective clinical endpoints were not different from those of control animals. Although the disease observed was mild, IDV induced neutrophil tracking and epithelial attenuation in cattle trachea, which could facilitate coinfection with other pathogens, and in doing so, predispose animals to bovine respiratory disease.

Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by the avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) or 
Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that comprises a diverse group of viruses with a 
single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. ND is one of the most important 
diseases of chickens, because it severely affects poultry production worldwide. 
In the 1970s, outbreaks of virulent ND were recorded in Brazil, and the strain 
APMV-1/Chicken/Brazil/SJM/75 (SJM) of NDV was isolated. This strain was 
characterized as highly pathogenic for chickens but not pathogenic for other 
bird species. Here we present the complete genome of NDV strain SJM and 
investigate the phylogenetic relationships of this virus with other NDV strains 
in terms of genome and proteins composition, as well as characterizing its 
evolution process. The NDV strain SJM is categorized as a velogenic virus and 
the complete genome is 15,192 nucleotides in length, consisting of six genes in 
the order 3'-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5'. The presence of the major pathogenic determinant 
of NDV strains ((112)R-R-Q-K-R↓F(117)) was identified in the Fusion protein of 
the NDV strain SJM. In addition, phylogenetic analysis classified the NDV strain 
SJM as a member of class II, genotype V, and indicates that this virus help us 
in the understanding of the evolutionary process of strains belonging to this 
genotype. This study contributes to the growing interest involving the 
characterization of NDV isolates to improve our current understanding about the 
epidemiology, surveillance and evolution of the pathogenic strains.

Oligonucleotide microchip for subtyping of influenza A virus,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Background </jats:bold> Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes depending on the antigenic properties of their two outer glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Sixteen subtypes of HA and nine of NA are known. Lately, the circulation of some subtypes (H7N7, H5N1) has been closely watched because of the epidemiological threat they present.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Objectives </jats:bold> This study assesses the potential of using gel‐based microchip technology for fast and sensitive molecular subtyping of the influenza A virus.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods </jats:bold> The method employs a microchip of 3D gel‐based elements containing immobilized probes. Segments of the HA and NA genes are amplified using multiplex RT‐PCR and then hybridized with the microchip.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> The developed microchip was validated using a panel of 21 known reference strains of influenza virus. Selected strains represented different HA and NA subtypes derived from avian, swine and human hosts. The whole procedure takes 10 hours and enables one to identify 15 subtypes of HA and two subtypes of NA. Forty‐one clinical samples isolated during the poultry fall in Novosibirsk (Russia, 2005) were successfully identified using the proposed technique. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were 76% and 100%, respectively, compared with the ‘gold standard’ techniques (virus isolation with following characterization by immunoassay).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions </jats:bold> We conclude that the method of subtyping using gel‐based microchips is a promising approach for fast detection and identification of influenza A, which may greatly improve its monitoring.</jats:p>",0
Bat Astroviruses: Towards Understanding the Transmission Dynamics of a Neglected Virus Family,"<jats:p>Bats belong to the order Chiroptera that represents the second largest order of mammals with more than 1200 species and an almost global distribution. Environmental changes and deforestation have severely influenced many ecosystems, intensifying the contact between wildlife and humans. In recent years, bats have been found to harbor a number of different viruses with zoonotic potential, as well as a great diversity of astroviruses, for which the question of zoonotic potential remains unanswered to date. Human astroviruses have been identified as the causative agent for diarrhea in children and immunocompromised patients. For a long time, astroviruses have been considered to be strictly species-specific. However, a great genetic diversity has recently been discovered among animal and human astroviruses that might indicate the potential of these viruses to cross species barriers. Furthermore, our knowledge about the tissue tropism of astroviruses has been expanded to some neurotropic strains that have recently been shown to be responsible for encephalitis in humans and livestock. This review gives an overview on what is known about astroviruses in bats, humans and livestock, especially bovines and pigs. Future research activities are suggested to unravel astrovirus infection dynamics in bat populations to further assess the zoonotic potential of these viruses.</jats:p>",0
A mutation ‘hot spot’ in the Schmallenberg virus M segment,"<jats:p>In the autumn of 2011, Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a novel orthobunyavirus of the Simbu serogroup, was identified by metagenomic analysis in Germany. SBV has since been detected in ruminants all over Europe, and investigations on phylogenetic relationships, clinical signs and epidemiology have been conducted. However, until now, only comparative sequence analysis of SBV genome segments with other species of the Simbu serogroup have been performed, and detailed data on the S and M segments, relevant for virus–host-cell interaction, have been missing. In this study, we investigated the S- and M-segment sequences obtained from 24 SBV-positive field samples from sheep, cattle and a goat collected from all over Germany. The results obtained indicated that the overall genome variability of SBV is neither regionally nor host species dependent. Nevertheless, we characterized for the first time a region of high sequence variability (a mutation ‘hot spot’) within the glycoprotein Gc encoded by the M segment.</jats:p>",0

Rift Valley fever is considered to be one of the most important viral zoonoses 
in Africa. In 2000, the Rift valley fever virus spread to the Arabian Peninsula 
and caused two simultaneous outbreaks in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. It is 
transmitted to ruminants and to humans by mosquitoes. The viral agent is an 
arbovirus, which belongs to the Phlebovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. 
This family of viruses comprises more than 300 members grouped into five genera: 
Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus, Hantavirus, Nairovirus, and Tospovirus. Several 
members of the Bunyaviridae family are responsible for fatal hemorrhagic fevers: 
Rift Valley fever virus (Phlebovirus), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus 
(Nairovirus), Hantaan, Sin Nombre and related viruses (Hantavirus), and recently 
Garissa, now identified as Ngari virus (Orthobunyavirus). Here are reviewed 
recent advances in Rift Valley fever virus, its epidemiology, molecular biology 
and focus on recent data on the interactions between viral and cellular 
proteins, which help to understand the molecular mechanisms utilized by the 
virus to circumvent the host cellular response.

Influenza D in Italy: towards a better understanding of an emerging viral infection in swine,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Influenza D virus (IDV), a new member of the <jats:italic>Orthomyxoviridae</jats:italic> family, was first reported in 2011 in swine in Oklahoma, and consequently found in cattle across North America and Eurasia. To investigate the circulation of IDV among pigs in Italy, in the period between June 2015 and May 2016, biomolecular and virological tests were performed on 845 clinical samples collected from 448 pig farms affected by respiratory distress located in the Po Valley. Serological tests were conducted on 3698 swine sera, including archive sera collected in 2009, as well as samples collected in 2015 from the same region. Viral genome was detected in 21 (2.3%) samples from 9 herds (2%), while virus was successfully isolated from 3 samples. Genetic analysis highlighted that Italian swine IDVs are closely related to the D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 cluster. Sera collected in 2015 showed a high prevalence of IDV antibody titers (11.7%), while archive sera from 2009 showed statistically significant lower positivity rates (0.6%). Our results indicate an increasing epidemiological relevance of the pathogen and the need for in-depth investigations towards understanding its pathogenesis, epidemiology and possible zoonotic potential of this emerging virus.</jats:p>",0
Genetic diversity among pandemic 2009 influenza viruses isolated from a transmission chain,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Influenza viruses such as swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) generate genetic diversity due to the high error rate of their RNA polymerase, often resulting in mixed genotype populations (intra-host variants) within a single infection. This variation helps influenza to rapidly respond to selection pressures, such as those imposed by the immunological host response and antiviral therapy. We have applied deep sequencing to characterize influenza intra-host variation in a transmission chain consisting of three cases due to oseltamivir-sensitive viruses, and one derived oseltamivir-resistant case.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Following detection of the A(H1N1)pdm09 infections, we deep-sequenced the complete <jats:italic>NA</jats:italic> gene from two of the oseltamivir-sensitive virus-infected cases, and all eight gene segments of the viruses causing the remaining two cases.</jats:p>

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>No evidence for the resistance-causing mutation (resulting in <jats:italic>NA</jats:italic> H275Y substitution) was observed in the oseltamivir-sensitive cases. Furthermore, deep sequencing revealed a subpopulation of oseltamivir-sensitive viruses in the case carrying resistant viruses. We detected higher levels of intra-host variation in the case carrying oseltamivir-resistant viruses than in those infected with oseltamivir-sensitive viruses.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Oseltamivir-resistance was only detected after prophylaxis with oseltamivir, suggesting that the mutation was selected for as a result of antiviral intervention. The persisting oseltamivir-sensitive virus population in the case carrying resistant viruses suggests either that a small proportion survive the treatment, or that the oseltamivir-sensitive virus rapidly re-establishes itself in the virus population after the bottleneck. Moreover, the increased intra-host variation in the oseltamivir-resistant case is consistent with the hypothesis that the population diversity of a RNA virus can increase rapidly following a population bottleneck.</jats:p>

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enterically transmitted human pathogen. HEV 
infections are mainly associated with acute, self-limited, icteric hepatitis 
with an average mortality rate of 1%. Animal reservoirs are considered to play 
an important role in the maintenance of the virus and in the spread of HEV to 
humans. HEV-induced seroconversion was described in several species, however 
clinical hepatitis in animals has not been observed to date. HEV strains from 
animals are genetically closely related to human HEV isolates, which supports 
the opinions on the zoonotic transmission of the virus. In this expansive study 
the occurrence of HEV was investigated in Hungarian wild and domesticated animal 
samples. HEV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
in liver samples of wild boars, roe deer, and deer. The investigations of 
domestic swine samples detected HEV in 39% of the investigated Hungarian pig 
farms. Simultaneous investigation revealed no definite difference between liver 
and faeces samples of domestic pigs in the frequency of HEV positivity. The 
highest (36%) incidence of HEV infection was found among the 11-16-week-old 
pigs. Samples from domestic cattle and rodents collected in pig farms, forests 
and meadows were tested negative for HEV RNA. Phylogenetic analysis of partial 
sequences amplified within the ORF1 and ORF2 regions of selected strains 
revealed that the detected viruses belong to three subgroups of the third 
genogroup of HEV, and are closely related to human and swine HEV strains 
detected in different countries. The investigations revealed widespread 
distribution of HEV in Hungarian wild ungulate and domesticated swine 
populations, with considerable genetic diversity among the strains.

The avian infectious bronchitis virus is classified into serotypes or genotypes 
(or both) in different poultry-producing countries of the world. In Brazil, 
Massachusetts type (Mass), used as a live vaccine, and local field Brazilian 
variants (genotypes; BR) predominate in the commercial poultry flocks. This 
study describes the development and validation of two real-time 
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) for the specific 
detection of Mass and BR genotypes in allantoic fluids and clinical samples. 
Genotype-specific primers, combined with a generic probe targeted to the S1 
gene, originated Mass RT-qPCR and BR RT-qPCR-specific assays. Analytical 
sensitivity and linearity of these assays were determined in comparison with an 
IBV generic real-time RT-PCR based on the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR 
RT-qPCR). Mass RT-qPCR detected five Mass field isolates, three vaccine samples, 
and one coinfected sample (BR and Mass) while BR RT-qPCR detected 16 BR field 
isolates. Both assays were linear (R(2) > 0.98), reproducible, and as sensitive 
as the classical 5'UTR RT-qPCR used to detect IBV. In the analysis of 141 IBV 
clinical samples, 8 were positive for Mass RT-qPCR, 76 for BR RT-qPCR, and 2 for 
both assays. In the remaining 55 samples, 25 were positive only for 5'UTR 
RT-qPCR and 30 were negative for the three assays. In conclusion, both assays 
were able to detect Mass and BR genotypes, allowing rapid and easy IBV molecular 
typing from allantoic fluids and clinical samples.

Discovery of parvovirus-related sequences in an unexpected broad range of animals,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Our knowledge of the genetic diversity and host ranges of viruses is fragmentary. This is particularly true for the <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic> family. Genetic diversity studies of single stranded DNA viruses within this family have been largely focused on arthropod- and vertebrate-infecting species that cause diseases of humans and our domesticated animals: a focus that has biased our perception of parvovirus diversity. While metagenomics approaches could help rectify this bias, so too could transcriptomics studies. Large amounts of transcriptomic data are available for a diverse array of animal species and whenever this data has inadvertently been gathered from virus-infected individuals, it could contain detectable viral transcripts. We therefore performed a systematic search for parvovirus-related sequences (PRSs) within publicly available transcript, genome and protein databases and eleven new transcriptome datasets. This revealed 463 PRSs in the transcript databases of 118 animals. At least 41 of these PRSs are likely integrated within animal genomes in that they were also found within genomic sequence databases. Besides illuminating the ubiquity of parvoviruses, the number of parvoviral sequences discovered within public databases revealed numerous previously unknown parvovirus-host combinations; particularly in invertebrates. Our findings suggest that the host-ranges of extant parvoviruses might span the entire animal kingdom.</jats:p>",0
Classification of Cowpox Viruses into Several Distinct Clades and Identification of a Novel Lineage,"<jats:p>Cowpox virus (CPXV) was considered as uniform species within the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV). Previous phylogenetic analysis indicated that CPXV is polyphyletic and isolates may cluster into different clades with two of these clades showing genetic similarities to either variola (VARV) or vaccinia viruses (VACV). Further analyses were initiated to assess both the genetic diversity and the evolutionary background of circulating CPXVs. Here we report the full-length sequences of 20 CPXV strains isolated from different animal species and humans in Germany. A phylogenetic analysis of altogether 83 full-length OPV genomes confirmed the polyphyletic character of the species CPXV and suggested at least four different clades. The German isolates from this study mainly clustered into two CPXV-like clades, and VARV- and VACV-like strains were not observed. A single strain, isolated from a cotton-top tamarin, clustered distantly from all other CPXVs and might represent a novel and unique evolutionary lineage. The classification of CPXV strains into clades roughly followed their geographic origin, with the highest clade diversity so far observed for Germany. Furthermore, we found evidence for recombination between OPV clades without significant disruption of the observed clustering. In conclusion, this analysis markedly expands the number of available CPXV full-length sequences and confirms the co-circulation of several CPXV clades in Germany, and provides the first data about a new evolutionary CPXV lineage.</jats:p>",0
Exploratory metagenomic analyses of periweaning failure‐to‐thrive syndrome‐affected pigs,"<jats:p>Modern pig farming is characterised by the emergence of several syndromes whose aetiology is unclear or has a multifactorial origin, including periweaning failure‐to‐thrive syndrome (PFTS). In fact, its specific aetiology remains elusive, although several causes have been investigated over time. The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of viral agents in PFTS‐affected and healthy animals by evaluating the virome composition of different organs using a metagenomic approach. This analysis allowed demonstrating a higher abundance of <jats:italic>Porcine parvovirus 6</jats:italic> (PPV6) in healthy subjects while <jats:italic>Ungulate bocaparvovirus 2</jats:italic> (BoPV2), <jats:italic>Ungulate protoparvovirus 1</jats:italic> (PPV) and <jats:italic>Porcine circovirus 3</jats:italic> (PCV‐3) were increased in pigs with PFTS. No differential abundance of RNA viruses was found between PFTS‐affected and control pigs. Remarkably, this is the first molecular characterisation of PPV6 and BoPV2 in Spain and one of the few all around the world, supporting their apparent widespread circulation. Interestingly, PCV‐3 has been recently identified in several clinical‐pathological conditions as well as in healthy pigs, while BoPV2 pathogenic potential is unknown. Although obtained results must be taken as preliminary, they open the door for further studies on the potential role of these viruses or their combination as predisposing factor/s for PFTS occurrence.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: A LEP transcript up-regulated in lungs of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) 
infected by avian influenza A virus was recently described in the Nature 
Genetics manuscript that reported the duck genome. In vertebrates, LEP gene 
symbol is reserved for leptin, the key regulator of energy balance in mammals.
RESULTS: Launching an extensive search for this gene in the genome data that was 
submitted to the public databases along with duck genome manuscript and 
extending this search to all avian genomes in the whole-genome 
shotgun-sequencing database, we were able to report the first identification of 
coding sequences capable of encoding the full leptin protein precursor in wild 
birds. Gene structure, synteny and sequence-similarity (up to 54% identity and 
68% similarity) to reptilian leptin evident in falcons (Falco peregrinus and 
cherrug), tits (Pseudopodoces humilis), finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and doves 
(Columba livia) confirmed that the bird leptin was a true ortholog of its 
mammalian form. Nevertheless, in duck, like other domestic fowls the LEP gene 
was not identifiable.
CONCLUSION: Lack of the LEP gene in poultry suggests that birds that have lost 
it are particularly suited to domestication. Identification of an intact avian 
gene for leptin in wild birds might explain in part the evolutionary 
conservation of its receptor in leptin-less fowls.

Crystal Structure of Swine Vesicular Disease Virus and Implications for Host Adaptation,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Swine vesicular disease virus</jats:italic>
            (SVDV) is an

            of the family
            <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>
            that causes symptoms indistinguishable from those of foot-and-mouth disease virus. Phylogenetic studies suggest that it is a recently evolved genetic sublineage of the important human pathogen coxsackievirus B5 (CBV5), and in agreement with this, it has been shown to utilize the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) for cell entry. The 3.0-Å crystal structure of strain UK/27/72 SVDV (highly virulent) reveals the expected similarity in core structure to those of other picornaviruses, showing most similarity to the closest available structure to CBV5, that of coxsackievirus B3 (CBV3). Features that help to cement together and rigidify the protein subunits are extended in this virus, perhaps explaining its extreme tolerance of environmental factors. Using the large number of capsid sequences available for both SVDV and CBV5, we have mapped the amino acid substitutions that may have occurred during the supposed adaptation of SVDV to a new host onto the structure of SVDV and a model of the SVDV/CAR complex generated by reference to the cryo-electron microscopy-visualized complex of CBV3 and CAR. The changes fall into three clusters as follows: one lines the fivefold pore, a second maps to the CAR-binding site and partially overlaps the site for decay accelerating factor (DAF) to bind to echovirus 7 (ECHO7), and the third lies close to the fivefold axis, where the low-density lipoprotein receptor binds to the minor group of rhinoviruses. Later changes in SVDV (post-1971) map to the first two clusters and may, by optimizing recognition of a pig CAR and/or DAF homologue, have improved the adaptation of the virus to pigs.

To develop a new approach for the detection and typing of duck hepatitis A virus 
(DHAV), a pair of non-degenerate primers was designed to amplify a approximately 
250-bp genomic region in the 5'UTR. 3 reference strains and 6 duck 
embryo-derived isolates from various regions in China, involving 2 serotypes, 
were successfully amplified with the primer set. By determining the nucleotide 
sequence of the amplicon, a molecular typing method was developed. If isolate 
sequences were compared to DHAV 5'UTR sequences available in public databases, 
nucleotide identity was > or =94% with homologous serotype and < or =73% with 
heterologous serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed monophyletic clustering 
of 5'UTR sequences of a homologous serotype, confirming the new classification 
of DHAV (serotype 1 and the two new serotypes recently described in Taiwan and 
South Korea, respectively) into three genotypes (A, B and C) defined by the 
capsid coding region. Analysis of the results showed that the primer pair should 
aid in the detection of DHAV, and that the amplicon sequence contains 
type-specific information and can be used for effective and rapid molecular 
typing. The molecular methods proved their utility through the detection and 
typing of DHAV directly from 28 liver specimens collected from dead ducklings 
during duck viral hepatitis outbreaks in different regions of China between 2001 
and 2007. The results confirmed the presence of DHAV in all of the 28 samples 
and demonstrated that genotypes A (13/28) and C (15/28) of DHAV are 
co-circulating in China.

Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) can induce a host antiviral response to foot and mouth 
disease virus (FMDV) in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the mechanism of IFN-γ 
anti FMDV infection in host cells, high-throughput RNA sequencing was analyzed 
for systemic changes in gene expression profiles in PK15 cells infected by FMDV 
with or without IFN-γ pretreatment. More than 25 million reads, covering 1.2-1.5 
Gb, were analyzed from each experiment panel. FMDV challenge altered the 
transcription of genes involved in positively and negatively regulating cell 
death or apoptosis; however, the expected immune suppression response was not 
obvious. IFN-γ pretreatment combined with FMDV infection normalized the increase 
in apoptosis. Furthermore, the transcription factors required for IFN-γ 
functioning, STAT1 and IRF1 were up-regulated by IFN-γ pretreatment and 
stimulated downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These induced ISGs are mainly 
responsible for antigen processing, antigen presentation or antiviral defense. 
Interestingly, a synergistic effect on some ISGs, including OAS1, OAS2, MX1, 
MX2, RIG-I and IFIT1, was observed in the combined treatment compared to the 
IFN-γ treatment alone. The suggested effects identified by RNA sequencing were 
consistent with cellular morphology changes and confirmed by related protein 
markers. This is the first report exploring transcriptome alterations introduced 
by FMDV infection with or without IFN-γ pretreatment. The identified key host 
genes that control cell survival in vitro broaden our comprehensive 
understanding of how IFN-γ inhibits FMDV infection and may shed light on 
developing improved FMD control approaches.

In this study, a novel bovine group A rotavirus (RV-A), Sun9, isolated from calf 
diarrhea in the Tochigi Prefecture, Japan, was characterized genetically by the 
sequence analysis of the genome segments encoding VP4 and VP7. The nucleotide 
and deduced amino acid sequences of the genome segments encoding VP4 and VP7 of 
Sun9 revealed high homology with P[14] human and lapine RV-As (80.2-88.7% and 
90.9-94.8%) and G8 bovine and human RV-As (83.1-95.5% and 92.3-98.2%). Sun9 was 
also classified into P[14] and G8 in the phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide 
sequences of the genome segments encoding VP4 and VP7. Although previous reports 
have suggested that P[14],G8 human RV-As isolated until now were obtained from 
the reassortment between human and bovine RV-As, or the interspecies 
transmission of bovine RV-A to human, no P[14],G8 bovine RV-A has yet been 
reported. Sun9 may be initial direct evidence of the above hypothesis.

Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) causes significant disease in cattle including 
respiratory, fetal diseases, and reproductive tract infections. Control programs 
usually include vaccination with a modified live viral (MLV) vaccine. On 
occasion BoHV-1 strains are isolated from diseased animals or fetuses 
postvaccination. Currently there are no markers for differentiating MLV strains 
from field strains of BoHV-1. In this study several BoHV-1 strains were 
sequenced using whole-genome sequencing technologies and the data analyzed to 
identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Strains sequenced included the 
reference BoHV-1 Cooper strain (GenBank Accession JX898220), eight commercial 
MLV vaccine strains, and 14 field strains from cases presented for diagnosis. 
Based on SNP analyses, the viruses could be classified into groups having 
similar SNP patterns. The eight MLV strains could be differentiated from one 
another although some were closely related to each other. A number of field 
strains isolated from animals with a history of prior vaccination had SNP 
patterns similar to specific MLV viruses, while other field isolates were very 
distinct from all vaccine strains. The results indicate that some BoHV-1 
isolates from clinically ill cattle/fetuses can be associated with a prior MLV 
vaccination history, but more information is needed on the rate of BoHV-1 genome 
sequence change before irrefutable associations can be drawn.

All genes of avian influenza A viruses are phylogenetically distinguished into 
two large clades, namely the American and Eurasian clade. Reassortments among 
the gene segments of influenza viruses belonging to the two distinct clades are 
rare events and have never been described in poultry in Europe and Asia before. 
This study presents the genetic characterization of two influenza viruses 
isolated from domestic mallards in Italy in 2004 and 2005. Phylogenetic analysis 
of the entire genome showed that these viruses contain mixed gene segments 
belonging to the American and Eurasian clades.

Unexpected Interfarm Transmission Dynamics during a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Epidemic,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Next-generation sequencing technology is now being increasingly applied to study the within- and between-host population dynamics of viruses. However, information on avian influenza virus evolution and transmission during a naturally occurring epidemic is still limited. Here, we use deep-sequencing data obtained from clinical samples collected from five industrial holdings and a backyard farm infected during the 2013 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 epidemic in Italy to unravel (i) the epidemic virus population diversity, (ii) the evolution of virus pathogenicity, and (iii) the pathways of viral transmission between different holdings and sheds. We show a high level of genetic diversity of the HPAI H7N7 viruses within a single farm as a consequence of separate bottlenecks and founder effects. In particular, we identified the cocirculation in the index case of two viral strains showing a different insertion at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, as well as nine nucleotide differences at the consensus level and 92 minority variants. To assess interfarm transmission, we combined epidemiological and genetic data and identified the index case as the major source of the virus, suggesting the spread of different viral haplotypes from the index farm to the other industrial holdings, probably at different time points. Our results revealed interfarm transmission dynamics that the epidemiological data alone could not unravel and demonstrated that delay in the disease detection and stamping out was the major cause of the emergence and the spread of the HPAI strain.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            The within- and between-host evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain during a naturally occurring epidemic is currently poorly understood. Here, we perform for the first time an in-depth sequence analysis of all the samples collected during a HPAI epidemic and demonstrate the importance to complement outbreak investigations with genetic data to reconstruct the transmission dynamics of the viruses and to evaluate the within- and between-farm genetic diversity of the viral population. We show that the evolutionary transition from the low pathogenic form to the highly pathogenic form occurred within the first infected flock, where we identified haplotypes with hemagglutinin cleavage site of different lengths. We also identify the index case as the major source of virus, indicating that prompt application of depopulation measures is essential to limit virus spread to other farms.

Identification of herpesvirus in biological material is usually carried out by 
real-time PCR. With the aim to classify the strain of virus identified, 
real-time PCR must be often supported by time-consuming capillary 
electrophoresis sequencing analysis. Here we provide a protocol for the rapid 
and reliable identification of 5 closely related herpesviruses by PyroMark Q24 
sequencing system. PyroMark performs DNA sequencing analysis using 
pyrosequencing, a technology based on the detection of released pyrophosphate 
during DNA elongation [1]. PyroMark is designed to detect changes in specified 
variable positions of the DNA. It can efficiently detect single nucleotide 
differences in sequences [2]. In the present paper we describe a protocol to 
pyrosequence a small polymorphic segment of the US8 gene. On the basis of the 
differences identified in the nucleotide sequence we could readily classify the 
herpesvirus as Bovine herpesvirus 1.1, Bovine herpesvirus 1.2, Bovine 
herpesvirus 5, Bubaline herpesvirus 1 or Caprine herpesvirus. The protocol set 
up offers several advantages with respect to the techniques commonly used: •it 
requires less than one working day to be carried;•it gives the possibility to 
analyze, at reasonable costs, up to 24 samples at a time; and•it allows to 
detect with great reliability and specificity strongly genetically correlated 
organisms like the herpesviruses named above. The procedure can be easily 
applied to other families of viruses, with opportune modifications.

Temperature-sensitive mutants of Chandipura virus. II. Phenotypic characteristics of the six complementation  groups,"<jats:p>Fifty temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of the rhabdovirus Chandipura virus have been classified into six complementation groups designated ChI to ChVI. Group ChI contains 44 mutants, group ChII contains 2 mutants, and the remaining groups have 1 mutant each. Mutants in groups ChI, ChIII, ChIV, and ChVI had RNA-negative phenotypes in experiments measuring amplification of RNA synthesis at restrictive temperature. The two mutants in group ChII had RNA-positive phenotypes, and the virions were thermolabile. Mutant ts Ch851 of group ChV was also RNA positive, and the M polypeptide of this mutant appeared to be unstable in cells incubated at restrictive temperature. It is likely, therefore, that complementation groups ChII and ChV represent the genes coding for the two viral proteins of the virion envelope. No precise assignment can be made in the case of the four RNA-negative groups, since all the mutants examined showed some polymerase activity in vitro at restrictive temperature. An attempt to obtain polymerase mutants by screening for sensitivity to rifampin was not successful. Six temperature-dependent host range mutants (the tdCE phenotype) of Chandipura virus failed to multiply in chicken embryo cells at restrictive temperature, but otherwise they differed in their host range properties from similar mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus.</jats:p>",0

Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and trypsin are reagents used in cell culture and have 
been the source of viral contamination of pharmaceutical products. We performed 
high throughput sequencing (HTS) of two pools of commercial batches of FBS and 
three commercial batches of trypsin. Taxonomies were assigned by comparing 
sequences of contigs and singletons to the entire NCBI nucleic acid and protein 
databases. The same major viral species were evidenced between batches of a 
given reagent but the proportion of viral reads among total reads varied 
markedly between samples (from 0.002% to 22.7%). In FBS, the sequences found 
were mainly from bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) 1 to 3 and bovine parvovirus 
3 (BPV3). The BVDV sequences derived from FBS showed only minor discrepancies 
with primers generally used for the screening of BVDV. Viral sequences in 
trypsin were mainly from porcine circovirus type 2. Other known viral sequences 
at lower read counts and potential new viral species (bovine parvovirus and 
bovine pegivirus) were evidenced. The load of some known and new viruses 
detected by HTS could be quantified by qPCR. Results of HTS provide a framework 
for evaluating the pertinence of control measures including the design of PCRs, 
bioassays and inactivation procedures.

Domestic ducks are considered a potential reservoir of Newcastle disease virus. 
In the study, a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolated from a domestic duck 
during surveillance in South Korea was characterized. The complete genome of the 
NDV isolate was sequenced, and the phylogenetic relationship to reference 
strains was studied. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain clustered in 
genotype I of Class II ND viruses, has highly phylogenetic similarity to NDV 
strains isolated from waterfowl in China, but was distant from the viruses 
isolated in chickens and vaccine strains used in South Korea. Pathogenicity 
experiment in chickens revealed it to be a lentogenic virus. The deduced amino 
acid sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein confirmed that the 
isolate contained the avirulent motif (112)GKQGRL(117) at the cleavage site and 
caused no apparent disease in chickens and ducks. With phylogeographic analysis 
based on fusion gene, we estimate the origin of an ancestral virus of the 
isolate and its sister strain located in China around 1998. It highlights the 
need of continuous surveillance to enhance current understanding of the 
molecular epidemiology and evolution of the pathogenic strains.

Alternative splicing (AS) plays a significant role in regulation of genomic 
expression at the transcriptional level and is involved in many important 
biological functions of cells, thus a gene can be spliced into distinct 
transcript variants then translated to many different kinds of protein. 
Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is a kind of retrovirus that can infect 
multiple avian species, leading to runting syndrome, immunosuppression and 
oncogenesis. In this present study, we analyzed AS in REV-infected chicken 
embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) which were inoculated with the second generation of 
REV (group VB) and compared with normal CEFs (group C) by high-throughput RNA 
sequencing technology. A total of 6,939 genes which were alternatively spliced 
were detected, among them, skipped exon (SE) was the most common pattern. 
Moreover, 5,607 AS genes were detected as differentially expressed; compared 
with group C, group VB has 2,825 genes upregulated significantly and 2,782 genes 
downregulated significantly. These 5,607 differentially expressed AS genes are 
involved in many important biological processes. Many of them are involved in 
apoptosis and tumourigenesis. We also proved, by agarose gel electrophoresis, 
that AS events predicted by our study are authentic and AS is closely related 
with apoptosis and tumourigenesis in REV-infected CEFs. Our study provides the 
best analysis to date of the potential link between AS and CEFs in response to 
REV infection. Research highlights Transcriptomics analysis of REV-infected CEFs 
using high-throughput sequencing. Potential link between alternative splicing 
and CEFs in response to REV infection. Skipped exon is the most common spliced 
pattern in REV-infected CEFs. Differentially expressed genes mainly involved in 
apoptosis and tumourigenesis.

The antigenic, pathogenic and molecular characteristics of Turkish sheep 
encephalitis (TSE) virus, strain TTE80, were compared with other members of the 
tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus complex. Monoclonal antibodies with defined 
specificity for the flavivirus envelope glycoprotein distinguished TSE virus 
from louping ill (LI), western or far eastern TBE, Langat and Powassan virus in 
indirect immunofluorescence, haemagglutination-inhibition and neutralization 
tests. On the other hand, TSE virus, which produces an LI-like disease in sheep, 
resembled LI virus in mouse neurovirulence tests. Molecular homology data of all 
the structural genes of TSE virus compared with other tick-borne flaviviruses 
demonstrated that TSE virus is a distinct member in the TBE virus subgroup. The 
data are consistent with the conclusion that TSE virus has evolved by a separate 
evolutionary pathway as compared with the close antigenic relatives, western 
European, far eastern TBE viruses and LI virus. By aligning the encoded amino 
acids in the viral envelope glycoprotein of mosquito- and tick-borne 
flaviviruses, we have also identified subgroup-specific pentapeptide motifs for 
the tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis and dengue subgroup viruses 
of the genus Flavivirus. These pentapeptides have important implications for the 
evolution, classification and diagnosis of flaviviruses.

OBJECTIVES: In the winter of 2013, people were facing the risk of human-to-human 
transmission of the re-emerging influenza A(H7N9) virus. We report herein 
information on the clinical features of two patients from the same family 
infected with this virus, the genomic sequences of the viruses harbored, and 
antiviral drug sensitivity.
METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological data of two patients from the same family 
were collected and analyzed. Sequencing was done for the viruses isolated from 
these two patients and one epidemiologically related chicken, and the sequences 
of the eight gene segments of the viruses were analyzed phylogenetically. The 
sensitivity of the viruses to antiviral drug treatment was determined by 
neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility test.
RESULTS: The two patients from one family cluster shared the same symptoms but 
had different outcomes, and had a strong epidemiological link. Three strains, 
two from these two patients and one from the chicken, were isolated. Genome 
sequencing and analyses of phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the two viruses 
were almost identical. We noted the presence of the PB2 E627K amino acid 
substitution that was not present in isolates from the first wave, as well as 
two new mutations in the NA gene and six in the PB2 gene. Drug sensitivity 
testing showed that the new isolates were resistant to oseltamivir but sensitive 
to peramivir.
CONCLUSIONS: The two patients from one family cluster were probable 
human-to-human transmission cases. The new isolates were sensitive to peramivir 
but showed reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir.

Although several miRNAs have been demonstrated to be involved in the influenza 
virus replication cycle, the identification of miRNAs and mRNAs that are 
expressed in A549 cells infected with influenza A viruses (IAVs) from different 
host species has remained poorly studied. To investigate the molecular 
mechanisms associated with the differential expression of miRNAs during 
influenza A virus infection, we performed global miRNA and mRNA expression 
profiling in A549 cells infected with human-origin seasonal influenza A virus 
H3N2 (Human_Br07), swine-origin influenza A virus H1N1 (SW_3861) or avian-origin 
influenza A virus H3N2 (AVI_9990). The miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were 
obtained by microarray and high-throughput sequencing analyses, respectively. 
The integrated analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed using bioinformatics tools, 
and the expression of miRNAs and mRNAs was validated by real-time quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We identified 20 miRNAs (6 upregulated and 
14 downregulated) and 1286 mRNAs (935 upregulated and 351 downregulated) 
exhibiting the same differential expression trends in three infected groups of 
cells compared with an uninfected control. An integrated analysis of these 
expression profiles identified 79 miRNA-mRNA pairs associated with the influenza 
A reference pathway, and 107 miRNA-mRNA interactions were correlated with the 
defense of the virus. Additionally, the obtained results were supported by an 
RT-qPCR analysis of 8 differentially expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-210-3p, 
hsa-miR-296-5p, hsa-miR-371a-5p, hsa-miR-762, hsa-miR-937-5p, hsa-miR-1915-3p, 
hsa-miR-3665, and hsa-miR-1290) and 13 differentially expressed mRNAs (IFNL1, 
CXCL10, RSAD2, MX1, OAS2, IFIT2, IFI44 L, MX2, XAF1, NDRG1, FGA, EGLN3, and 
TFRC). Our findings indicate that dysregulated miRNA expression plays a crucial 
role in infection caused by IAVs originating from different species and provide 
a foundation for further investigations of the molecular regulatory mechanisms 
of miRNAs involved in influenza A virus infection.

"Biological Heterogeneity, Including Systemic Replication in Mice, of H5N1 Influenza A Virus Isolates from Humans in Hong Kong","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            An H5N1 avian influenza A virus was transmitted to humans in Hong Kong in 1997. Although the virus causes systemic infection and is highly lethal in chickens because of the susceptibility of the hemagglutinin to furin and PC6 proteases, it is not known whether it also causes systemic infection in humans. The clinical outcomes of infection in Hong Kong residents ranged widely, from mild respiratory disease to multiple organ failure leading to death. Therefore, to understand the pathogenesis of influenza due to these H5N1 isolates, we investigated their virulence in mice. The results identified two distinct groups of viruses: group 1, for which the dose lethal for 50% of mice (MLD
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            ) was between 0.3 and 11 PFU, and group 2, for which the MLD
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            was more than 10
            <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>
            PFU. One day after intranasal inoculation of mice with 100 PFU of group 1 viruses, the virus titer in lungs was 10
            <jats:sup>7</jats:sup>
            PFU/g or 3 log units higher than that for group 2 viruses. Both types of viruses had replicated to high titers (&gt;10
            <jats:sup>6</jats:sup>
            PFU/g) in the lungs by day 3 and maintained these titers through day 6. More importantly, only the group 1 viruses caused systemic infection, replicating in nonrespiratory organs, including the brain. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the replication of a group 1 virus in brain neurons and glial cells and in cardiac myofibers. Phylogenetic analysis of all viral genes showed that both groups of Hong Kong H5N1 viruses had formed a lineage distinct from those of other viruses and that genetic reassortment between H5N1 and H1 or H3 human viruses had not occurred. Since mice and humans harbor both the furin and the PC6 proteases, we suggest that the virulence mechanism responsible for the lethality of influenza viruses in birds also operates in mammalian hosts. The failure of some H5N1 viruses to produce systemic infection in our model indicates that multiple, still-to-be-identified, factors contribute to the severity of H5N1 infection in mammals. In addition, the ability of these viruses to produce systemic infection in mice and the clear differences in pathogenicity among the isolates studied here indicate that this system provides a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of avian influenza virus infection in mammals.

Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 continues to pose a serious health threat to 
human beings. Cattle, a major reservoir of the pathogen, harbor E. coli O157:H7 
in their gastrointestinal tract and shed variable concentrations of E. coli 
O157:H7 into the environment. Genetic characterization of cattle-shed E. coli 
O157 strains is of interest to the livestock industry, food business, and public 
health community. The present study applied whole genome shotgun sequencing 
(WGS) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling to characterize 279 
cattle-shed E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from a single feedlot located in 
southwestern region of the US. More than 4,000 SNVs were identified among the 
strains and the resultant phylogenomic tree revealed three major groups. Using 
the Sakai strain genome as reference, more than 2,000 SNVs were annotated and a 
detailed SNV map generated. Results clearly revealed highly polymorphic loci 
along the E. coli O157:H7 genome that aligned with the prophage regions and 
highly variant genes involved in processing bacterial genetic information. The 
WGS data were further profiled against a comprehensive virulence factor database 
(VFDB) for virulence gene identification. Among the total 285 virulence genes 
identified, only 132 were present in all the strains. There were six virulence 
genes unique to single isolates. Our findings suggested that the genome 
variations of the E. coli O157:H7 were mainly attributable to dynamics of 
certain phages, and the bacterial strains have variable virulence gene profiles, 
even though they came from a single cattle population, which may explain the 
differences in pathogenicity, host prevalence, and transmissibility by E. coli 
O157:H7.

"Genomic Characterisation of Vinegar Hill Virus, An Australian Nairovirus Isolated in 1983 from Argas Robertsi Ticks Collected from Cattle Egrets","<jats:p>This report describes the near complete genomic sequence and subsequent analysis of Vinegar Hill virus (VINHV; tentative member of the genus Orthonairovirus, family Nairoviridae, order Bunyavirales). VINHV is the second nairovirus reported to be isolated on mainland Australia and the first to be sequenced and analysed. Our genetic analysis shows that VINHV belongs to the Dera Ghazi Khan genogroup, a group of viruses previously isolated in other parts of the world including Asia, South Africa, and the USA. We discuss possible routes of entry for nairoviruses into Australia and the need to understand the virome of Australian ticks in the context of new and emerging disease.</jats:p>",0
Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of <i>Bluetongue virus</i> serotype 2 strains isolated in the Americas including a novel strain from the western United States,"<jats:p> Bluetongue is a potentially fatal arboviral disease of domestic and wild ruminants that is characterized by widespread edema and tissue necrosis. Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes 10, 11, 13, and 17 occur throughout much of the United States, whereas serotype 2 (BTV-2) was previously only detected in the southeastern United States. Since 1998, 10 other BTV serotypes have also been isolated from ruminants in the southeastern United States. In 2010, BTV-2 was identified in California for the first time, and preliminary sequence analysis indicated that the virus isolate was closely related to BTV strains circulating in the southeastern United States. In the current study, the whole genome sequence of the California strain of BTV-2 was compared with those of other BTV-2 strains in the Americas. The results of the analysis suggest co-circulation of genetically distinct viruses in the southeastern United States, and further suggest that the 2010 western isolate is closely related to southeastern strains of BTV. Although it remains uncertain as to how this novel virus was translocated to California, the findings of the current study underscore the need for ongoing surveillance of this economically important livestock disease. </jats:p>",0
Antigenic relationships among some animal rotaviruses: virus neutralization in vitro and cross-protection in piglets,"<jats:p>The serotype, RNA electropherotype, and cross-protection properties of rotaviruses isolated from canine, simian, porcine, and human species were compared. The bovine strain B:USA:78:1A and the canine strain C:USA:81:2 were adapted to cell culture and cloned in this study. The other viruses, i.e., simian strain S:USA:79:2, porcine Ohio State University strain P:USA:77:1, and human strain WA, were already cell culture adapted, although they were further cloned for this work. The serum neutralization test was used to classify the viruses into serotype groups. Viruses which exhibited a difference of 20-fold or greater in neutralization titer were separated into different serotype groups. In this study, four major serotype groups were found, and these groups were represented by bovine, human, porcine, and canine-simian strains. From cross-protection studies, these serotype groups were found to be significantly different. With the exception of the porcine strain, none of the viruses used as vaccines protected gnotobiotic piglets from challenge with the virulent porcine Ohio State University strain of rotavirus. Furthermore, the canine virus protected piglets from challenge with the simian virus. The RNA electropherotype confirmed that the canine and simian strains were different in eight RNA segments and eliminated the possibility that they were the same virus. From these findings, it was concluded that only viruses belonging to the same serotype group can be expected to confer cross-protection, and thus, vaccines should be made with the serotypes to which the animal is likely to be exposed.</jats:p>",0

Influenza A viruses are spherical particles that attach to cells through bonds 
between hemagglutinin and specific cellular receptors. Numerous studies 
performed have recently revealed that Sialic acid (SA) is a crucial component of 
influenza A virus receptors. This brief review summarizes recent advances in our 
understanding of influenza A virus receptors. The introduction describes the 
classification of influenza A virus receptors and the review continues with a 
survey of the distribution of SA in different tissue and host. This is followed 
by research applications of influenza A virus receptors, and explanation of why 
receptor studies are so important on a world-wide scale.

Genetic diversity of novel circular ssDNA viruses in bats in China,"<jats:p>Novel circular ssDNA genomes have recently been detected in animals and in the environment using metagenomic and high-throughput sequencing approaches. In this study, five full-length circular ssDNA genomes were recovered from bat faecal samples using inverse PCR with sequences designed based on circovirus-related sequences obtained from Solexa sequencing data derived from a random amplification method. These five sequences shared a similar genomic organization to circovirus or the recently proposed cyclovirus of the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>. The newly obtained circovirus/cyclovirus-like genomes ranged from 1741 to 2177 bp, and each consisted of two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encoding putative replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively. The potential stem–loop region was predicted in all five genomes, and three of them had the typical conserved nonanucleotide motif of cycloviruses. A set of primers targeting the conserved Rep region was designed and used to detect the prevalence of circovirus/cyclovirus sequences in individual bats. Among 199 samples tested, 47 were positive (23.6 %) for the circovirus genome and two (1.0 %) were positive for the cyclovirus genome. In total, 48 partial Rep sequences plus the five full-length genomes were obtained in this study. Detailed analysis indicated that these sequences are distantly related to known circovirus/cyclovirus genomes and may represent 22 novel species that belong to the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: As the natural hosts of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), aquatic and 
migratory birds provide a gene pool for genetic transfer among species and 
across species, forming transient ""genome constellations."" This work describes 
the phylogenetic dynamics of H1NX based on the complete molecular 
characterization of eight genes of viruses that were collected from 2014 to 2015 
in Anhui Province, China.
METHODS: Hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition tests were used to 
determine the hemagglutination (HA) activity of the HA subtypes. The entire 
genomes of the viruses were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3500xl DNA Analyzer. The 
sequences were genetically analysed to study their genetic evolution using 
DNASTAR and MEGA 6. The pathogenic effects of the viruses were evaluated using 
mouse infection models.
RESULTS: Seven strains of the H1 subtype avian influenza virus were isolated. 
Phylogenetic analysis indicated natural recombination of the H1 influenza 
viruses between the Eurasian lineage and the North American lineage. Some genes 
had high sequence identity with A/bean goose/Korea/220/2011(H9N2), which is a 
typical case involving viral reassortment between the Eurasian lineage and the 
North American lineage. The results of infection experiments in mice showed that 
the viruses could acquire the ability to multiply in mouse respiratory organs 
without adaptation.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that continued surveillance of wild birds, 
particularly migratory birds, is important to provide early warning of possible 
H1 influenza epidemics and to understand the ecology of the virus.

Influenza virus surveillance, poultry outbreak investigations and genomic 
sequencing were assessed to understand the ecology and evolution of low 
pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2013. 
We analyzed 506 avian specimens collected from poultry in live bird markets and 
backyard flocks to identify influenza A viruses. Virus isolation-positive 
specimens (n = 50) were subtyped and their coding-complete genomes were 
sequenced. The most frequently identified subtypes among LPAI isolates were 
H9N2, H11N3, H4N6, and H1N1. Less frequently detected subtypes included H1N3, 
H2N4, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N2, H5N2, H6N1, H6N7, and H7N9. Gene sequences were 
compared to publicly available sequences using phylogenetic inference 
approaches. Among the 14 subtypes identified, the majority of viral gene 
segments were most closely related to poultry or wild bird viruses commonly 
found in Southeast Asia, Europe, and/or northern Africa. LPAI subtypes were 
distributed over several geographic locations in Bangladesh, and surface and 
internal protein gene segments clustered phylogenetically with a diverse number 
of viral subtypes suggesting extensive reassortment among these LPAI viruses. 
H9N2 subtype viruses differed from other LPAI subtypes because genes from these 
viruses consistently clustered together, indicating this subtype is enzootic in 
Bangladesh. The H9N2 strains identified in Bangladesh were phylogenetically and 
antigenically related to previous human-derived H9N2 viruses detected in 
Bangladesh representing a potential source for human infection. In contrast, the 
circulating LPAI H5N2 and H7N9 viruses were both phylogenetically and 
antigenically unrelated to H5 viruses identified previously in humans in 
Bangladesh and H7N9 strains isolated from humans in China. In Bangladesh, 
domestic poultry sold in live bird markets carried a wide range of LPAI virus 
subtypes and a high diversity of genotypes. These findings, combined with the 
seven year timeframe of sampling, indicate a continuous circulation of these 
viruses in the country.

Microarray resources for genetic and genomic studies in chicken: A review,"<jats:p>Advent of microarray technologies revolutionized the nature and scope of genetic and genomic research in human and other species by allowing massively parallel analysis of thousands of genomic sites. They have been used for diverse purposes such as for transcriptome analysis, CNV detection, SNP and CNV genotyping, studying DNA‐protein interaction, and detection of genome methylation. Microarrays have also made invaluable contributions to research in chicken which is an important model organism for studying embryology, immunology, oncology, virology, evolution, genetics, and genomics and also for other avian species. Despite their huge contributions in life science research, the future of microarrays is now being questioned with the advent of massively parallel next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which promise to overcome some of the limitations of microarray platforms. In this article we review the various microarray resources developed for chicken and their past and potential future applications. We also discuss about the future of microarrays in the NGS era particularly in the context of livestock genetics. We argue that even though NGS promises some major advantages—in particular, offers the opportunity to discover novel elements in the genome—microarrays will continue to be major tools for research and practice in the field of livestock genetics/genomics due to their affordability, high throughput nature, mature established technologies and ease of application. Moreover, with advent of new microarray technologies like capture arrays, the NGS and microarrays are expected to complement each other in future research in life science. genesis 51:337–356. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",0

For more than a quarter of a century, sequencing technologies from Sanger's 
method to next-generation high-throughput techniques have provided fascinating 
opportunities in the life sciences. The continuing upward trajectory of 
sequencing technologies will improve livestock research and expedite the 
development of various new genomic and technological studies with farm animals. 
The use of high-throughput technologies in livestock research has increased 
interest in metagenomics, epigenetics, genome-wide association studies, and 
identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations. 
Such studies are beginning to provide revolutionary insights into biological and 
evolutionary processes. Farm animals, such as cattle, swine, and horses, have 
played a dual role as economically and agriculturally important animals as well 
as biomedical research models. The first part of this study explores the current 
state of sequencing methods, many of which are already used in animal genomic 
studies, and the second part summarizes the state of cattle, swine, horse, and 
chicken genome sequencing and illustrates its achievements during the last few 
years. Finally, we describe several high-throughput sequencing approaches for 
the improved detection of known, unknown, and emerging infectious agents, 
leading to better diagnosis of infectious diseases. The insights from viral 
metagenomics and the advancement of next-generation sequencing will strongly 
support specific and efficient vaccine development and provide strategies for 
controlling infectious disease transmission among animal populations and/or 
between animals and humans. However, prospective sequencing technologies will 
require further research and in-field testing before reaching the marketplace.

Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) are members of the Pestivirus genus within 
the family Flaviviridae. Based on antigenic and nucleotide differences, BVDV are 
classified into two recognized species, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. More recently, a new 
putative pestivirus species, tentatively called ""HoBi-like"", has been associated 
with bovine viral diarrhea. HoBi-like viruses were first identified in fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) imported from Brazil. Subsequently, a number of HoBi-like 
viruses have been detected as contaminants in FBS or cell culture and in live 
ruminants. To further investigate the possible pestivirus contamination in 
commercially available FBS batches, 26 batches of FBS with various countries of 
origin, were tested in this study for the presence of bovine pestiviruses. All 
the 26 batches were positive by RT-PCR for at least one species of bovine 
pestiviruses. HoBi-like viruses were detected in 15 batches. Analysis of the 
5'UTR and N(pro) sequences of 15 newly identified HoBi-like viruses combined 
with analysis of additional sequences from GenBank, identified 4 genetic groups 
tentatively named 3a-3d. The current study confirmed the presence of the 
emerging HoBi-like viruses in FBS products labeled with different geographic 
origins. This finding has obvious implications for the safety of biological 
products, such cell lines and vaccines.

Pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 species is responsible for 
cosmopolitan diseases affecting cattle and other ruminants, presenting a wide 
range of clinical manifestations, with relevant impact on zootechnic production. 
Understanding genomic characteristic and virus taxonomy is fundamental in order 
to sustain control and prophylactic programs. Given the recent various studies 
reporting a relatively high number of new strains, in particular from Asian 
countries, in the present study, four hundred-eighty-two genomic sequences have 
been evaluated applying the palindromic nucleotide substitutions method for 
genotyping. Based on the secondary structure alignment and computing genetic 
distance among strains in the 5' untranslated region of Pestivirus RNA, the 
current taxonomy of the species was reviewed. Twenty-two genotypes have been 
identified, applying a nomenclature based on divergence in the genus.

Phage therapy in livestock methane amelioration.,"<title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Viruses of prokaryotes (phages) are obligate microbial pathogens that can, in the lytic phase of development, infect and lyse their respective bacterial or archaeal hosts. As such, these viruses can reduce the population density of their hosts rapidly, and have been viewed as possible agents of biological control (phage therapy). Phage therapy is becoming increasingly important as a means of eradicating or controlling microbial populations as the use of antibiotics and chemical treatments becomes both less effective and less publicly acceptable. Phage therapy has therefore been raised as a potential strategy to reduce methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from ruminants, providing an innovative biological approach, harnessing the potent, yet targeted, biocidal attributes of these naturally occurring microbial predators.</p>",0
Whole-Genome Sequencing in Outbreak Analysis,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>In addition to the ever-present concern of medical professionals about epidemics of infectious diseases, the relative ease of access and low cost of obtaining, producing, and disseminating pathogenic organisms or biological toxins mean that bioterrorism activity should also be considered when facing a disease outbreak. Utilization of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in outbreak analysis facilitates the rapid and accurate identification of virulence factors of the pathogen and can be used to identify the path of disease transmission within a population and provide information on the probable source. Molecular tools such as WGS are being refined and advanced at a rapid pace to provide robust and higher-resolution methods for identifying, comparing, and classifying pathogenic organisms. If these methods of pathogen characterization are properly applied, they will enable an improved public health response whether a disease outbreak was initiated by natural events or by accidental or deliberate human activity. The current application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to microbial WGS and microbial forensics is reviewed.</jats:p>",0

Deltaretroviruses such as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and bovine 
leukemia virus (BLV) induce a persistent infection that remains generally 
asymptomatic but can also lead to leukemia or lymphoma. These viruses replicate 
by infecting new lymphocytes (i.e. the infectious cycle) or via clonal expansion 
of the infected cells (mitotic cycle). The relative importance of these two 
cycles in viral replication varies during infection. The majority of infected 
clones are created early before the onset of an efficient immune response. Later 
on, the main replication route is mitotic expansion of pre-existing infected 
clones. Due to the paucity of available samples and for ethical reasons, only 
scarce data is available on early infection by HTLV-1. Therefore, we addressed 
this question in a comparative BLV model. We used high-throughput sequencing to 
map and quantify the insertion sites of the provirus in order to monitor the 
clonality of the BLV-infected cells population (i.e. the number of distinct 
clones and abundance of each clone). We found that BLV propagation shifts from 
cell neoinfection to clonal proliferation in about 2 months from inoculation. 
Initially, BLV proviral integration significantly favors transcribed regions of 
the genome. Negative selection then eliminates 97% of the clones detected at 
seroconversion and disfavors BLV-infected cells carrying a provirus located 
close to a promoter or a gene. Nevertheless, among the surviving proviruses, 
clone abundance positively correlates with proximity of the provirus to a 
transcribed region. Two opposite forces thus operate during primary infection 
and dictate the fate of long term clonal composition: (1) initial integration 
inside genes or promoters and (2) host negative selection disfavoring proviruses 
located next to transcribed regions. The result of this initial response will 
contribute to the proviral load set point value as clonal abundance will benefit 
from carrying a provirus in transcribed regions.

Bovine herpesvirus (BHV), a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, is 
classified into neurovirulent and non-neurovirulent subtypes on a basis of 
differential neuropathogenicities. Transcription of viral immediate early (IE) 
genes during alphaherpesvirus gene expression, is mediated by a multi-component 
immediate early complex (IEC) integrated by the viral tegument protein alpha 
trans-inducing factor (alpha-tif), a host cell protein (HCF), and a host Octamer 
protein (Oct). In this paper, we present a sequence analysis of the alpha-tif of 
the encephalitic BHV subtype, bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BHV-5). Bovine 
herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) and BHV-5 alpha-tifs share 98% amino acid sequence 
homology. However, BHV-5 alpha-tif is 23 residues shorter at the amino terminus 
than BHV-1 alpha-tif. Amino acid alignment of the alpha-tifs of BHV-1 and BHV-5 
with other alphaherpesviruses indicates areas of conserved motifs but also 
important differences located mainly at the amino and carboxyl termini.

Serological surveys for small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infections have 
revealed seropositive sheep in several mixed herds, where sheep are kept 
together with seropositive goats. Here we have examined the genetic 
relationships in LTR, pol and env surface unit (SU) and the growth patterns in 
goat (GSM) and sheep (FOS) synovial membrane cell cultures of SRLV isolates 
obtained from both mixed and single species herds. Phylogenetic analyses of pol 
and env SU revealed that Norwegian SRLVs derived from both goat and sheep in 
mixed herds are distributed into group C, while isolates obtained from unmixed 
sheep flocks cluster in group A, together with maedi-visna-like representatives 
of the A1 subtype. In this study, the direction of group C virus transmission is 
proposed to be from goat to sheep. The replication efficiency in GSM and FOS 
cultures and the cytopathic phenotype induced by the SRLV isolates gave no 
indication of any species-specific characteristics. No particular nucleotide 
sequences of the LTR-U3 region or env SU were identified that could be related 
to cytopathic phenotype. This study shows that sheep in Norway harbour SRLVs 
belonging to phylogenetic groups A and C, and this provides further evidence for 
cross-species infection being a regular characteristic of SRLVs, which may 
represent an important source for viral persistence.

Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is a ubiquitous and important pathogen of cattle 
worldwide. This study reports the identification of 10 microRNA (miRNA) genes, 
Bhv1-mir-B1-Bhv1-mir-B10, encoded by the BoHV-1 genome that were processed into 
12 detectable mature miRNAs as determined by ultra-high throughput sequencing 
bioinformatics analyses of small RNA libraries and expression studies. We found 
that four of the miRNA genes were present as two copies in the BoHV-1 genome, 
resulting in a total of 14 miRNA encoding loci. Unique features of the BoHV-1 
miRNAs include evidence of bidirectional transcription and a close association 
of two miRNA genes with the origin of replication, including one miRNA that is 
encoded within the origin of replication. The miRNA gene Bhv1-mir-B5 was encoded 
on the opposite DNA strand to the latency associated transcript, potentially 
giving rise to antisense transcripts originating from this locus. The 
association of herpesvirus miRNAs with latency appears to be a common feature in 
the alphaherpesviruses. Analyses of the BoHV-5 genome for putative miRNA gene 
orthologues identified a high degree of evolutionary conservation for nine of 
the BoHV-1 miRNA genes. The possible roles for BoHV-1 miRNAs in the regulation 
of known BoHV-1 transcription units and the genetics of the BoHV-1 genotypes are 
also discussed.

Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N8, 
clade 2.3.4.4, were first reported in January 2014 from South Korea. These 
viruses spread rapidly to Europe and the North American continent during autumn 
2014 and caused, in Germany, five outbreaks in poultry holdings until February 
2015. In addition, birds kept in a zoo in north-eastern Germany were affected. 
Only a few individual white storks (Ciconia ciconia) showed clinical symptoms 
and eventually died in the course of the infection, although subsequent in-depth 
diagnostic investigations showed that other birds kept in the same compound of 
the white storks were acutely positive for or had undergone asymptomatic 
infection with HPAIV H5N8. An exception from culling all of the 500 remaining 
zoo birds was granted by the competent authority. Restriction measures included 
grouping the zoo birds into eight epidemiological units in which 60 birds of 
each unit tested repeatedly negative for H5N8. Epidemiological and 
phylogenetical investigations revealed that the most likely source of 
introduction was direct or indirect contact with infected wild birds as the 
white storks had access to a small pond frequented by wild mallards and other 
aquatic wild birds during a period of 10 days in December 2014. Median network 
analysis showed that the zoo bird viruses segregated into a distinct cluster of 
clade 2.3.4.4 with closest ties to H5N8 isolates obtained from mute swans 
(Cygnus olor) in Sweden in April 2015. This case demonstrates that alternatives 
to culling exist to rescue valuable avifaunistic collections after incursions of 
HPAIV.

Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important human and animal pathogens with high 
impact on human and animal health. In Denmark, a passive surveillance program 
for IAV in pigs has been performed since 2011, where screening tests and 
subsequent subtyping are performed by reverse transcription quantitative 
real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). A disadvantage of the current subtyping system is that 
several assays are needed to cover the wide range of circulating subtypes, which 
makes the system expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, the aim of the present 
study was to develop a high-throughput method, which could improve surveillance 
of swine influenza viruses (swIAVs) and lower the costs of virus subtyping. 
Twelve qPCR assays specific for various hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene 
lineages relevant for swIAV and six assays specific for the internal genes of 
IAV were developed and optimized for the high-throughput qPCR platform BioMark 
(Fluidigm). The qPCR assays were validated and optimized to run under the same 
reaction conditions using a 48.48 dynamic array (48.48DA). The sensitivity and 
specificity was assessed by testing virus isolates and field samples with known 
subtypes. The results revealed a performance of the swIAV 48.48DA similar to 
conventional real-time analysis, and furthermore, the specificity of swIAV 
48.48DA was very high and without cross reactions between the assays. This 
high-throughput system provides a cost-effective alternative for subtyping of 
swIAVs.

"Potential for Co-Infection of a Mosquito-Specific Flavivirus, Nhumirim Virus, to Block West Nile Virus Transmission in Mosquitoes","<jats:p>Nhumirim virus (NHUV) is an insect-specific virus that phylogenetically affiliates with dual-host mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Previous in vitro co-infection experiments demonstrated prior or concurrent infection of Aedes albopictus C6/36 mosquito cells with NHUV resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in viral production of West Nile virus (WNV). This interference between WNV and NHUV was observed herein in an additional Ae. albopictus mosquito cell line, C7-10. A WNV 2K peptide (V9M) mutant capable of superinfection with a pre-established WNV infection demonstrated a comparable level of interference from NHUV as the parental WNV strain in C6/36 and C7-10 cells. Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex pipiens mosquitoes intrathoracically inoculated with NHUVandWNV, or solely withWNVas a control, were allowed to extrinsically incubate the viruses up to nine and 14 days, respectively, and transmissibility and replication of WNV was determined. The proportion of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes capable of transmitting WNV was significantly lower for the WNV/NHUV group than the WNV control at seven and nine days post inoculation (dpi), while no differences were observed in the Cx. pipiens inoculation group. By dpi nine, a 40% reduction in transmissibility in mosquitoes from the dual inoculation group was observed compared to the WNV-only control. These data indicate the potential that infection of some Culex spp. vectors with NHUV could serve as a barrier for efficient transmissibility of flaviviruses associated with human disease.</jats:p>",0
The Interplay Between MDV and HVT Affects Viral miRNA Expression,"1. Avian Dis. 2013 Jun;57(2 Suppl):372-9. doi: 10.1637/10440-110112-Reg.1.

It is well established that herpesviruses encode numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) and 
that these virally encoded small RNAs play multiple roles in infection. The 
present study was undertaken to determine how co-infection of a pathogenic MDV 
serotype one (MDV1) strain (MD5) and a vaccine strain (herpesvirus of turkeys 
[HVT]) alters viral miRNA expression in vivo. We first used small RNA deep 
sequencing to identify MDV1-encoded miRNAs that are expressed in tumorigenic 
spleens of MDV1-infected birds. The expression patterns of these miRNAs were 
then further assessed at an early time point (7 days postinfection [dpi]) and a 
late time point (42 dpi) in birds with and without HVT vaccination using 
real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Additionally, the effect of MDV1 co-infection on 
HVT-encoded miRNAs was determined using RT-PCR. A diverse population of miRNAs 
was expressed in MDV-induced tumorigenic spleens at 42 dpi, with 18 of the 26 
known mature miRNAs represented. Of these, both mdv1-miR-M4-5p and 
mdv1-miR-M2-3p were the most highly expressed miRNAs. RT-PCR analysis further 
revealed that nine MDV miRNAs were differentially expressed between 7 dpi and 42 
dpi infected spleens. At 7 dpi, three miRNAs were differentially expressed 
between the spleens of birds co-infected with HVT and MD5 compared with birds 
singly infected with MD5, whereas at 42 dpi, nine miRNAs were differentially 
expressed. At 7 dpi, the expression of seven HVT-encoded miRNAs was affected in 
the spleens of co-infected birds compared with birds only receiving the HVT 
vaccine. At 42 dpi, six HVT-encoded miRNAs were differentially expressed between 
the two groups. Target prediction analysis suggests that these differentially 
expressed viral miRNAs are involved in regulating several cellular processes, 
including cell proliferation and the adaptive immune response.

I used phylogenetic analyses to reconstruct patterns of directional 
interspecific transmission during a pseudorabies virus outbreak in Illinois, 
USA, in 1989. Isolates were recovered from five species: cattle, sheep, goats, 
pigs, and raccoons (Procyon lotor). I generated DNA sequences for 16 isolates of 
pseudorabies virus at the glycoprotein C gene, from which I constructed 
phylogenetic trees. I then used these trees, in combination with parsimony-based 
analyses of character evolution, to infer the frequency and direction of 
interspecific transmission events. Comparing inferred frequencies and directions 
of transmission to null expectations based on 10,000 random trees indicated a 
significant excess of transmission events from pigs to pigs and a corresponding 
lack of transmission events from non-porcine species. These results are 
concordant with the know biology and natural history of pseudorabies virus, and 
they demonstrate that retrospective phylogeny reconstruction and analyses of 
character evolution can be used to investigate the transmission ecology of 
pathogens.

Bluetongue (BT), an arthropod-borne viral disease of ruminants, a ects sheep 
most severely than other domestic animals. Bluetongue virus serotype 24 (BTV-24) 
is one of 26 known Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes. In this article, we present 
data of phylogenetic analysis of 9 viral genes (Seg1, Seg2, Seg3, Seg4, Seg5, 
Seg6, Seg8, Seg9, and Seg10) from 8 Israeli BTV-24 isolates and relate the 
genotype of the BTV-24 isolates to their phenotype with regard to clinical 
manifestations. The high level of genetic identity (> 99.6%) between Seg2, Seg4 
and Seg5 in all 8 BTV-24 isolates indicated that these segments shared the same 
viral ancestor. Phylogenetic analysis of Seg1, Seg3, Seg5, Seg8, Seg9, and Seg10 
revealed that the Israeli BTV-24 strains comprised 4 variants. Five of the 
viruses revealed high identity among all 9 segments, and represented variant 1. 
A second variant (BTV24/3027/6/10), isolated in 2010, showed signi cant 
variation from variant 1 in 3 gene segments (VP-1, VP-3, and NS-3 genes). A 
third variant (BTV24/3027/1/10) showed signi cant variation from variant 1 in 6 
segments (VP-1, VP-3, VP-6 and NS-1, NS-2 and NS-3 genes), while a fourth 
variant (BTV24/2214/1/10) showed signi cant variation from variant 1 in 4 
segments (VP-1, NS-1, NS-2 and NS-3 genes). These marked di erences in sequence 
identity indicate that a high level of genetic reassortment is occurring between 
co-circulating BTV strains in Israel.

This review summarizes most recent information on the bovine cytomegalovirus 
BHV-4. The virus is not associated with clearly defined clinical entities in 
cattle. It can easily be isolated in tissue culture and has a broad host range. 
BHV-4 strains are rather similar in restriction enzyme analysis of their DNAs, 
the size of the pr DNAs, however, differs. The genome represents a 
gamma-herpesvirus. Because of its uniqueness BHV-4 is discussed as an 
appropriate vector.

Genetic diversity of bovine viral diarrhea virus in cattle from Mexico,"<jats:p> Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infects cattle populations worldwide, causing significant economic losses though its impact on animal health. Previous studies have reported the prevalence of BVDV species and subgenotypes in cattle from the United States and Canada. We investigated the genetic diversity of BVDV strains detected in bovine serum samples from 6 different Mexican regions. Sixty-two BVDV isolates from Mexico were genetically typed based on comparison of sequences from the 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the viral genome. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that 60 of the samples belonged to the BVDV-1 genotype and 2 to the BVDV-2 genotype. Comparison of partial 5′-UTR sequences clustered 49 samples within BVDV-1c, 8 samples within BVDV-1a, 3 samples within BVDV-1b, and 2 samples clustered with the BVDV-2a subgenotypes. Our study, combined with information previously published on BVDV field strain diversity in the United States and Canada, benefits the development of effective detection assays, vaccines, and control programs for North America. </jats:p>",0

The genus Pestivirus within Flaviviridae is comprised of four recognized 
species, namely, bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1), bovine viral diarrhoea 
virus 2 (BVDV-2), border disease virus (BDV) and classical swine fever virus 
(CSFV). BDV, while primarily infecting sheep and goats, has also been reported 
in cattle and wild animals. Infections of sheep and goats result in economic 
loss due to abortions and the birth of persistently infected animals that have 
poor production and reduced life expectancy. In this study, we report the 
detection of BDV in cattle serum collected as part of pestivirus surveillance 
programme from six regions of Mexico, where a 67.1% of BVDV seroprevalence was 
calculated previously. Phylogenetic analyses based on comparison of the 5'UTR 
region typed the Mexican strains as BDV-1. Border disease (BD) is listed as an 
exotic disease in Mexico, and the origin of BDV found in these cattle is 
unclear. This is the first identification of BDV in Mexican cattle.

BACKGROUND: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pestivirus which infects 
both domestic animals and wildlife species worldwide. In China, cattle are often 
infected with BVDV of different genotypes, but there is very limited knowledge 
regarding BVDV infection in Chinese yaks and the genetic diversity of the virus. 
The objectives of this study were to detect viral infection in yaks in Qinghai, 
China and to determine the genotypes of BVDV based on analysis of the 
5'untranslated region (5'UTR) and N-terminal protease (N(pro)) region.
RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2012, 407 blood samples were collected from yaks with 
or without clinical signs in six counties of Qinghai Province. Ninety-eight 
samples (24%) were found to be positive by reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting a conserved region of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. The 
nucleotide sequences of the 5'UTR and complete N(pro) region were determined for 
16 positive samples. Phylogenetic reconstructions demonstrated that all 16 
samples belong to subgenotypes BVDV-1b, BVDV-1d and BVDV-1q.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides, for the first time, molecular evidence for 
BVDV infection in yaks in Qinghai involving multiple subgenotypes of BVDV-1. 
This may have occurred under three possible scenarios: interspecies 
transmission, natural infection, and the use of vaccines contaminated with BVDV. 
The results have important implications for yak production and management in 
China, and specifically indicate that unscientific vaccination practices should 
be stopped and bio-security increased.

The origin of hepadnaviruses (Hepadnaviridae), a group of reverse-transcribing 
DNA viruses that infect vertebrates, remains mysterious. All the known 
retrotransposons are only distantly related to hepadnaviruses. Here, we report 
the discovery of two novel lineages of retroelements, which we designate 
hepadnavirus-like retroelement (HEART1 and HEART2), within the insect genomes 
through screening 1, 095 eukaryotic genomes. Both phylogenetic and similarity 
analyses suggest that the HEART retroelements represent the closest nonviral 
relatives of hepadnaviruses so far. The discovery of HEART retroelements narrows 
down the evolutionary gap between hepadnaviruses and retrotransposons and might 
thus provide unique insights into the origin and evolution of hepadnaviruses.

As successive epidemics have swept the world, the scientific community has 
quickly learned from them about the emergence and transmission of communicable 
diseases. Epidemics usually occur when health systems are unprepared. During an 
unexpected epidemic, health authorities engage in damage control, fear drives 
action, and the desire to understand the threat is greatest. As humanity 
recovers, policy-makers seek scientific expertise to improve their 
""preparedness"" to face future events.Global spread of disease is exemplified by 
the spread of yellow fever from Africa to the Americas, by the spread of dengue 
fever through transcontinental migration of mosquitos, by the relentless 
influenza virus pandemics, and, most recently, by the unexpected emergence of 
Ebola virus, spread by motorbike and long haul carriers. Other pathogens that 
are remarkable for their epidemic expansions include the arenavirus hemorrhagic 
fevers and hantavirus diseases carried by rodents over great geographic 
distances and the arthropod-borne viruses (West Nile, chikungunya and Zika) 
enabled by ecology and vector adaptations. Did we learn from the past epidemics? 
Are we prepared for the worst?The ultimate goal is to develop a resilient global 
health infrastructure. Besides acquiring treatments, vaccines, and other 
preventive medicine, bio-surveillance is critical to preventing disease 
emergence and to counteracting its spread. So far, only the western hemisphere 
has a large and established monitoring system; however, diseases continue to 
emerge sporadically, in particular in Southeast Asia and South America, 
illuminating the imperfections of our surveillance. Epidemics destabilize 
fragile governments, ravage the most vulnerable populations, and threaten the 
global community.Pandemic risk calculations employ new technologies like 
computerized maintenance of geographical and historical datasets, Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS), Next Generation sequencing, and Metagenomics to trace 
the molecular changes in pathogens during their emergence, and mathematical 
models to assess risk. Predictions help to pinpoint the hot spots of emergence, 
the populations at risk, and the pathogens under genetic evolution. Preparedness 
anticipates the risks, the needs of the population, the capacities of 
infrastructure, the sources of emergency funding, and finally, the international 
partnerships needed to manage a disaster before it occurs. At present, the world 
is in an intermediate phase of trying to reduce health disparities despite 
exponential population growth, political conflicts, migration, global trade, 
urbanization, and major environmental changes due to global warming. For the 
sake of humanity, we must focus on developing the necessary capacities for 
health surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and pandemic response.

Similarity of the outer capsid protein VP4 of the Gottfried strain of porcine rotavirus to that of asymptomatic human rotavirus strains,"<jats:p>Genomic segment 4 of the porcine Gottfried strain (serotype 4) of porcine rotavirus, which encodes the outer capsid protein VP4, was sequences, and its deduced amino acid sequence was analyzed. Amino acid homology of the porcine rotavirus VP4 to the corresponding protein of asymptomatic or symptomatic human rotaviruses representing serotypes 1 to 4 ranged from 87.1 to 88.1% for asymptomatic strains and from 77.5 to 77.8% for symptomatic strains. Amino acid homology of the Gottfried strain to simian rhesus rotavirus, simian SA11 virus, bovine Nebraska calf diarrhea virus, and porcine OSU strains ranged from 71.5 to 74.3%. Antigenic similarities of VP4 epitopes between the Gottfried strain and human rotaviruses were detected by a plaque reduction neutralization test with hyperimmune antisera produced against the Gottfried strain or a Gottfried (10 genes) x human DS-1 rotavirus (VP7 gene) reassortant which exhibited serotype 2 neutralization specificity. In addition, a panel of six anti-VP4 monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing human rotaviruses belonging to serotype 1, 3, or 4 was able to neutralize the Gottfried strain. These observations suggest that the VP4 outer capsid protein of the Gottfried rotavirus is more closely related to human rotaviruses than to animal rotaviruses.</jats:p>",0

Newcastle disease (ND) is an economically important, contagious poultry viral 
disease reported across the globe. In India, ND is endemic and episodes of ND 
outbreaks despite strict vaccinations are not uncommon. We isolated and 
characterized seven ND viruses from vaccinated commercial poultry farms during 
severe disease outbreaks in Tamil Nadu, in Southern India, between April 2015 
and June 2016. All the seven isolates were categorized as virulent by mean death 
time (48-54 hr) in embryonated chicken eggs. Also, their sequences carried the 
virulence signature of multi-basic amino acid residues in their fusion protein 
cleavage site (RRQ/RR/KRF). Phylogenetic and evolutionary distance analyses 
revealed circulation of a novel sub-genotype of genotype XIII, class II ND 
viruses, herein proposed as sub-genotype XIIIe. The genetic divergence between 
the circulating virulent strains and the vaccine strains could possibly explain 
the disease outbreak in the vaccinated flocks. Further, our study signifies the 
need to implement routine epidemiological surveillance and to revisit the 
current vaccination program.

Advances in antiviral vaccine development,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Antiviral vaccines have been the most successful biomedical intervention for preventing epidemic viral disease. Vaccination for smallpox in humans and rinderpest in cattle was the basis for disease eradication, and recent progress in polio eradication is promising. Although early vaccines were developed empirically by passage in live animals or eggs, more recent vaccines have been developed because of the advent of new technologies, particularly cell culture and molecular biology. Recent technological advances in gene delivery and expression, nanoparticles, protein manufacturing, and adjuvants have created the potential for new vaccine platforms that may provide solutions for vaccines against viral pathogens for which no interventions currently exist. In addition, the technological convergence of human monoclonal antibody isolation, structural biology, and high‐throughput sequencing is providing new opportunities for atomic‐level immunogen design. Selection of human monoclonal antibodies can identify immunodominant antigenic sites associated with neutralization and provide reagents for stabilizing and solving the structure of viral surface proteins. Understanding the structural basis for neutralization can guide selection of vaccine targets. Deep sequencing of the antibody repertoire and defining the ontogeny of the desired antibody responses can reveal the junctional recombination and somatic mutation requirements for B‐cell recognition and affinity maturation. Collectively, this information will provide new strategic approaches for selecting vaccine antigens, formulations, and regimens. Moreover, it creates the potential for rational vaccine design and establishing a catalogue of vaccine technology platforms that would be effective against any given family or class of viral pathogens and improve our readiness to address new emerging viral threats.</jats:p>",0

The situation in Europe concerning honeybees has in recent years become 
increasingly aggravated with steady decline in populations and/or catastrophic 
winter losses. This has largely been attributed to the occurrence of a variety 
of known and ""unknown"", emerging novel diseases. Previous studies have 
demonstrated that colonies often can harbour more than one pathogen, making 
identification of etiological agents with classical methods difficult. By 
employing an unbiased metagenomic approach, which allows the detection of both 
unexpected and previously unknown infectious agents, the detection of three 
viruses, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus (ALPV), Israel Acute Paralysis Virus 
(IAPV), and Lake Sinai Virus (LSV), in honeybees from Spain is reported in this 
article. The existence of a subgroup of ALPV with the ability to infect bees was 
only recently reported and this is the first identification of such a strain in 
Europe. Similarly, LSV appear to be a still unclassified group of viruses with 
unclear impact on colony health and these viruses have not previously been 
identified outside of the United States. Furthermore, our study also reveals 
that these bees carried a plant virus, Turnip Ringspot Virus (TuRSV), 
potentially serving as important vector organisms. Taken together, these results 
demonstrate the new possibilities opened up by high-throughput sequencing and 
metagenomic analysis to study emerging new diseases in domestic and wild animal 
populations, including honeybees.

Here, we analyze the complete coding sequences of all recognized tick-borne 
flavivirus species, including Gadgets Gully, Royal Farm and Karshi virus, 
seabird-associated flaviviruses, Kadam virus and previously uncharacterized 
isolates of Kyasanur Forest disease virus and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. 
Significant taxonomic improvements are proposed, e.g. the identification of 
three major groups (mammalian, seabird and Kadam tick-borne flavivirus groups), 
the creation of a new species (Karshi virus) and the assignment of Tick-borne 
encephalitis and Louping ill viruses to a unique species (Tick-borne 
encephalitis virus) including four viral types (i.e. Western Tick-borne 
encephalitis virus, Eastern Tick-borne encephalitis virus, Turkish sheep 
Tick-borne encephalitis virus and Louping ill Tick-borne encephalitis virus). 
The analyses also suggest a complex relationship between viruses infecting birds 
and those infecting mammals. Ticks that feed on both categories of vertebrates 
may constitute the evolutionary bridge between the three distinct identified 
lineages.

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has recently approved 
several proposals submitted by the present Caliciviridae Study Group. These 
proposals include the division of the family into 4 new genera designated 
Lagovirus, Vesivirus, ""Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs), and ""Sapporo-like viruses 
(SLVs); the latter 2 genera were assigned temporary names until acceptable names 
can be determined by the scientific community. The genera have been further 
divided into the following species: Feline calicivirus and Vesicular exanthema 
of swine virus (genus Vesivirus), Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and European 
brown hare syndrome virus (genus Lagovirus), Norwalk virus (genus NLV), and 
Sapporo virus (genus SLV). In addition, the ICTV approved a proposal to remove 
the hepatitis E virus from the Caliciviridae into an ""unassigned classification 
status.

"Next-Generation Sequence Analysis of the Genome of RFHVMn, the Macaque Homolog of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS)-Associated Herpesvirus, from a KS-Like Tumor of a Pig-Tailed Macaque","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Macaca nemestrina</jats:named-content>
            (RFHVMn), the pig-tailed macaque homolog of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), was determined by next-generation sequence analysis of a Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-like macaque tumor. Colinearity of genes was observed with the KSHV genome, and the core herpesvirus genes had strong sequence homology to the corresponding KSHV genes. RFHVMn lacked homologs of open reading frame 11 (ORF11) and KSHV ORFs K5 and K6, which appear to have been generated by duplication of ORFs K3 and K4 after the divergence of KSHV and RFHV. RFHVMn contained positional homologs of all other unique KSHV genes, although some showed limited sequence similarity. RFHVMn contained a number of candidate microRNA genes. Although there was little sequence similarity with KSHV microRNAs, one candidate contained the same seed sequence as the positional homolog, kshv-miR-K12-10a, suggesting functional overlap. RNA transcript splicing was highly conserved between RFHVMn and KSHV, and strong sequence conservation was noted in specific promoters and putative origins of replication, predicting important functional similarities. Sequence comparisons indicated that RFHVMn and KSHV developed in long-term synchrony with the evolution of their hosts, and both viruses phylogenetically group within the RV1 lineage of Old World primate rhadinoviruses. RFHVMn is the closest homolog of KSHV to be completely sequenced and the first sequenced RV1 rhadinovirus homolog of KSHV from a nonhuman Old World primate. The strong genetic and sequence similarity between RFHVMn and KSHV, coupled with similarities in biology and pathology, demonstrate that RFHVMn infection in macaques offers an important and relevant model for the study of KSHV in humans.

Although metagenomics has been previously employed for pathogen discovery, its 
cost and complexity have prevented its use as a practical front-line diagnostic 
for unknown infectious diseases. Here we demonstrate the utility of two 
metagenomics-based strategies, a pan-viral microarray (Virochip) and deep 
sequencing, for the identification and characterization of 2009 pandemic H1N1 
influenza A virus. Using nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the earliest 
stages of the pandemic in Mexico, Canada, and the United States (n = 17), the 
Virochip was able to detect a novel virus most closely related to swine 
influenza viruses without a priori information. Deep sequencing yielded reads 
corresponding to 2009 H1N1 influenza in each sample (percentage of aligned 
sequences corresponding to 2009 H1N1 ranging from 0.0011% to 10.9%), with up to 
97% coverage of the influenza genome in one sample. Detection of 2009 H1N1 by 
deep sequencing was possible even at titers near the limits of detection for 
specific RT-PCR, and the percentage of sequence reads was linearly correlated 
with virus titer. Deep sequencing also provided insights into the upper 
respiratory microbiota and host gene expression in response to 2009 H1N1 
infection. An unbiased analysis combining sequence data from all 17 outbreak 
samples revealed that 90% of the 2009 H1N1 genome could be assembled de novo 
without the use of any reference sequence, including assembly of several near 
full-length genomic segments. These results indicate that a streamlined 
metagenomics detection strategy can potentially replace the multiple 
conventional diagnostic tests required to investigate an outbreak of a novel 
pathogen, and provide a blueprint for comprehensive diagnosis of unexplained 
acute illnesses or outbreaks in clinical and public health settings.

BACKGROUND: Data about molecular diversity of commonly circulating type A 
influenza viruses in Ontario swine are scarce. Yet, this information is 
essential for surveillance of animal and public health, vaccine updates, and for 
understanding virus evolution and its large-scale spread.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 21 swine herds with clinical problems 
due to respiratory disease. Nasal swabs from individual pigs were collected and 
tested by virus isolation in MDCK cells and by rtRT-PCR. All eight segments of 
10 H3N2 viruses were sequenced using high-throughput sequencing and molecularly 
characterized.
RESULTS: Within-herd prevalence ranged between 2 and 100%. Structurally, Ontario 
H3N2 viruses could be classified into three different groups. Group 1 was the 
most similar to the original trH3N2 virus from 2005. Group 2 was the most 
similar to the Ontario turkey H3N2 isolates with PB1 and NS genes originating 
from trH3N2 virus and M, PB2, PA and NP genes originating from the A(H1N1)pdm09 
virus. All Group 3 internal genes were genetically related to A(H1N1)pdm09. 
Analysis of antigenic sites of HA1 showed that Group 1 had 8 aa changes within 4 
antigenic sites, A(1), B(3), C(2) and E(2). The Group 2 viruses had 8 aa changes 
within 3 antigenic sites A(3), B(3) and C(2), while Group 3 viruses had 4 aa 
changes within 3 antigenic sites, B(1), D(1) and E(2), when compared to the 
cluster IV H3N2 virus [A/swine/Ontario/33853/2005/(H3N2)].
CONCLUSIONS: The characterization of the Ontario H3N2 viruses clearly indicates 
reassortment of gene segments between the North American swine trH3N2 from 
cluster IV and the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is widespread in the global pig population. 
Although clinically inapparent in pigs, HEV infection is the cause of Hepatitis 
E in humans and transmission via the food chain has been established. Following 
a 2013 study that investigated prevalence of HEV infection in UK slaughter-age 
pigs samples indicating highest viral load were selected for further 
characterisation. High throughput sequencing was used to obtain the complete 
coding sequence from five samples. An in-frame insertion was observed within the 
HEV hypervariable region in two samples. To interrogate whether this mutation 
may be the cause of high-level viraemia and faecal shedding as observed in the 
sampled pigs virus isolation and culture was conducted. Based on viral growth 
kinetics there was no evidence that these insertions affected replication 
efficiency in vitro, suggesting as yet undetermined host factors may affect the 
course of infection and consequently the risk of foodborne transmission.

In late 2011, a variant pseudorabies virus (vPRV) emerged in 
Bartha-K61-vaccinated pig herds, resulting in high morbidity and mortality of 
piglets in China. Since 2013, the autopsy lesions, histological examinations, 
virus isolation, phylogenetic analysis and selection pressure analysis of the gE 
gene of vPRV were recorded for 395 clinical cases, and 5,033 pig serum samples 
were detected by PRV gE-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The major 
clinical symptoms were abortion in pregnant sows, fatal neurological signs in 
piglets and respiratory disease in growing pigs. Necrotic splenitis, hepatitis 
and lymphadenitis, haemorrhagic nephritis and non-suppurative encephalitis were 
observed by histopathological examination. Typical eosinophilic inclusion bodies 
were found in the nuclei of liver cells. Using PCR, 110 samples among 395 
clinical cases tested positive for the gE gene. Fifteen vPRV strains were 
isolated and confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the gE gene. 
The strains shared 97.1%-99.9% nucleotide (nt) and 96.6%-99.5% amino acid (aa) 
homology with PRV reference strains. Selection pressure analysis showed that one 
site in the codons of glycoprotein E was under positive selection. Of the 5,033 
serum samples, 2,909 were positive by ELISA for a positive rate of 57.8%. These 
results showed that vPRV was still prevalent in Shandong Province, indicating 
severe PRV infectious pressure. The preparation of new vaccines against PRV is 
extremely urgent.

The Sichuan takin inhabits the bamboo forests in the Eastern Himalayas and is 
considered as a national treasure of China with the highest legal protection and 
conservation status considered as vulnerable according to The IUCN Red List of 
Threatened Species. In this study, fecal samples of 71 Sichuan takins were 
pooled and deep sequenced. Among the 103,553 viral sequences, 21,961 were 
assigned to mammalian viruses. De novo assembly revealed genomes of an 
enterovirus and an astrovirus and contigs of circoviruses and genogroup I 
picobirnaviruses. Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed 
that Sichuan takin enterovirus is a novel serotype/genotype of the species 
Enterovirus G, with evidence of recombination. Sichuan takin astrovirus is a new 
subtype of bovine astrovirus, probably belonging to a new genogroup in the genus 
Mamastrovirus. Further studies will reveal whether these viruses can also be 
found in Mishmi takin and Shaanxi takin and their pathogenic potentials.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in regulating eukaryotic 
genome replication and gene expression in diverse biological systems. Here, we 
identified lncRNAs transcribed from pseudorabies virus (PRV)-infected PK-15 
cells. Based on high-throughput sequencing data, we obtained 87,263,926 and 
93,947,628 clean reads from mock-infected and PRV-infected PK-15 cells, 
respectively. Through a normalized analytic protocol, we identified three novel 
viral lncRNAs. According to an analysis of differential expression between the 
mock-infected and PRV-infected cells, 4151 host lncRNAs were significantly 
upregulated and 2327 host lncRNAs were significantly downregulated in the latter 
group. Viral lncRNAs and several host lncRNAs were verified by northern blotting 
and real-time PCR. The findings showed that the viral lncRNA LDI might regulate 
the expression of IE180, a potent transcriptional activator of viral genes. 
Furthermore, we characterized the expression of viral lncRNAs in a culture of 
infected primary chicken dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Collectively, the obtained 
data suggest that PRV generates lncRNAs in both epithelial cells and chick DRG 
neurons.

Thirty-two muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) were captured for surveillance of avian 
influenza virus in wild waterfowl and mammals near Lake Chany, Western Siberia, 
Russia. A/muskrat/Russia/63/2014 (H2N2) was isolated from an apparently healthy 
muskrat using chicken embryos. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the hemagglutinin 
and neuraminidase genes of this isolate were classified into the Eurasian 
avian-like influenza virus clade and closely related to low pathogenic avian 
influenza viruses (LPAIVs) isolated from wild water birds in Italy and Sweden, 
respectively. Other internal genes were also closely related to LPAIVs isolated 
from Eurasian wild water birds. Results suggest that interspecies transmission 
of LPAIVs from wild water birds to semiaquatic mammals occurs, facilitating the 
spread and evolution of LPAIVs in wetland areas of Western Siberia.

Over the past few years, programmable RNA-guided nucleases such as the 
CRISPR/Cas9 system have ushered in a new era of precision genome editing in 
diverse model systems and in human cells. Functional screens using large 
libraries of RNA guides can interrogate a large hypothesis space to pinpoint 
particular genes and genetic elements involved in fundamental biological 
processes and disease-relevant phenotypes. Here, we review recent 
high-throughput CRISPR screens (e.g. loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and 
targeting noncoding elements) and highlight their potential for uncovering novel 
therapeutic targets, such as those involved in cancer resistance to small 
molecular drugs and immunotherapies, tumor evolution, infectious disease, inborn 
genetic disorders, and other therapeutic challenges.

In this study, a novel circular replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding 
single stranded (CRESS) DNA virus was discovered in diarrheic sample of a calf 
with severe hemorrhagic enteritis. The virus, named Bo-Circo-like virus CH, has 
a circular genome with 3909 nucleotides (nt). Six putative open reading frames 
(ORFs) were identified, including Rep, capsid (Cap) and four proteins of unknown 
function. Both the genome size and the number as well as the organization of 
encoded ORFs, Bo-Circo-like virus CH is most closely related to Po-Circo-like 
virus 21 detected in pig faeces. A preliminary survey using specific primers for 
the Rep region showed that 5.3% (4/75) of diarrheic samples were positive for 
Bo-Circo-like virus, and all 42 healthy samples were negative. In conclusion, 
our results indicate that Bo-Circo-like virus CH may represent a new virus in 
bovine. Further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between 
the virus infection and diarrhea.

Marek's disease (MD), caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV), is a highly 
contagious neoplastic disease of chicken that can be prevented by vaccination. 
However, in recent years many cases of vaccine failure have been reported 
worldwide as chickens develop symptoms of MD in spite of proper vaccination. 
Distinct polymorphism and point mutations in Meq gene of MDV have been reported 
to be associated with virulence and oncogenicity. The present study was carried 
out with the objective to isolate and characterize field isolates of MDV on the 
basis of Meq gene. Twenty five samples of suspected cases of MD were collected 
and processed for virus isolation in duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) primary 
culture where 28% (7 of 25) samples showed characteristic cytopathic effects of 
MDV in the form of plaques and syncytia. Additional evidence of presence of MDV 
in these samples was confirmed by PCR. To analyze diversity in all seven 
isolates of MDV, a polymorphism study was carried out by cloning and sequencing 
of full length of Meq gene (1020 bp). Sequence homology of 7 isolates with 23 
reference strains showed 98.10-99.40% similarity in nucleotide and 95.90-98.50% 
similarity in amino acid sequences. Six isolates revealed 5 repeat sequences of 
4 prolines (PPPP) whereas, one isolate revealed only 4 repeats. In phylogenetic 
analysis, these isolates formed a separate cluster showing close relatedness to 
the Chinese isolates. The study indicates a high mutation rate in field isolates 
of MDV that may be probable cause of vaccination failure.

There are 15 subtypes of influenza A virus (H1-H15), all of which are found in 
avian species. Three caused pandemics in the last century: H1 in 1918 (and 
1977), H2 in 1957 and H3 in 1968. In 1997, an H5 avian virus and in 1999 an H9 
virus caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in Hong Kong. We have determined 
the three-dimensional structures of the haemagglutinins (HAs) from H5 avian and 
H9 swine viruses closely related to the viruses isolated from humans in Hong 
Kong. We have compared them with known structures of the H3 HA from the virus 
that caused the 1968 H3 pandemic and of the HA--esterase--fusion (HEF) 
glycoprotein from an influenza C virus. Structure and sequence comparisons 
suggest that HA subtypes may have originated by diversification of properties 
that affected the metastability of HAs required for their membrane fusion 
activities in viral infection.

Interspecies transmission of pathogens may result in the emergence of new 
infectious diseases in humans as well as in domestic and wild animals. Genomics 
tools such as high-throughput sequencing, mRNA expression profiling, and 
microarray-based analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms are providing 
unprecedented ways to analyze the diversity of the genomes of emerging pathogens 
as well as the molecular basis of the host response to them. By comparing and 
contrasting the outcomes of an emerging infection with those of closely related 
pathogens in different but related host species, we can further delineate the 
various host pathways determining the outcome of zoonotic transmission and 
adaptation to the newly invaded species. The ultimate challenge is to link 
pathogen and host genomics data with biological outcomes of zoonotic 
transmission and to translate the integrated data into novel intervention 
strategies that eventually will allow the effective control of newly emerging 
infectious diseases.

Recurrent outbreaks of H5N1 HPAIV occurred in several Central European countries 
in 2007. In-depth phylogenetic analyses which included full-length genomic 
sequences of the viruses involved were performed to elucidate possible origins 
of incursions and transmission pathways. Tree reconstructions as well as 
host-shift and ancestral area inferences were conducted in a maximum likelihood 
framework. All viruses belonged to a separate subgroup (termed ""EMA-3"") within 
clade 2.2, and, thus, were distinct from two lineages of HPAIV H5N1 viruses 
(termed ""EMA-1"" and ""EMA-2"") present in the same geographic area in 2006. 
Analysis of concatenated coding regions of all eight genome segments 
significantly improved resolution and robustness of the reconstructed 
phylogenies as compared to single gene analyses. At the same time, the 
methodological limits to establish retrospectively transmission networks in a 
comparatively small geographic region and spanning a short period of time became 
evident when only few corroborating field-epidemiological data are available. 
Ambiguities remained concerning the origin of the EMA-3 viruses from a region 
covering Southeast Germany and the Czech Republic as well as routes of spread to 
other European countries. AIV monitoring programmes in place for wild birds and 
poultry in these countries did not reveal presence of these viruses in either 
population. Host switches between domestic poultry and wild bird populations 
occurred several times. Analysis of outbreaks in Northeast Germany and nearby 
Northern Poland in December 2007 demonstrated that geographic and even temporal 
vicinity of outbreaks does not necessarily indicate a common source of 
incursion.

Newly discovered mosquito viruses help control vector-borne viral diseases,"<jats:p>Many well-known mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, Zika, West Nile, chikungunya and Ross River viruses can be transmitted to vertebrates and are associated with disease in man or animals. However, the use of deep sequencing and other open-minded approaches to detect viruses in mosquitoes have uncovered many new RNA viruses, most of which do not infect vertebrates. The discovery of these ‘insect-specific' viruses (ISVs) has redefined the mosquito virome and prompted the lines of viral taxonomic classification to be redrawn1,2. Despite their benign phenotype, ISVs have become a hot topic of research, with recent studies indicating they have significant application for biotechnology.</jats:p>",0

Published studies have shown that workers in animal slaughterhouses are at a 
higher risk of lung cancers as compared to the general population. No specific 
causal agents have been identified, and exposures to several chemicals have been 
examined and found to be unrelated. Evidence suggests a biological aetiology as 
the risk is highest for workers who are exposed to live animals or to biological 
material containing animal faeces, urine or blood. To investigate possible 
biological exposures in animal slaughterhouses, we used a metagenomic approach 
to characterise the profile of organisms present within an aerosol sample. An 
assessment of aerosol exposures for individual workers was achieved by the 
collection of personal samples that represent the inhalable fraction of 
dust/bioaerosol in workplace air in both cattle and sheep slaughterhouses. Two 
sets of nine personal aerosol samples were pooled for the cattle processing and 
sheep processing areas respectively, with a total of 332,677,346 sequence reads 
and 250,144,492 sequence reads of 85 bp in length produced for each. Eukaryotic 
genome sequence was found in both sampling locations, and bovine, ovine and 
human sequences were common. Sequences from WU polyomavirus and human 
papillomavirus 120 were detected in the metagenomic dataset from the cattle 
processing area, and these sequences were confirmed as being present in the 
original personal aerosol samples. This study presents the first metagenomic 
description of personal aerosol exposure and this methodology could be applied 
to a variety of environments. Also, the detection of two candidate viruses 
warrants further investigation in the setting of occupational exposures in 
animal slaughterhouses.

Understanding risk factors for bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) transmission is 
important for planning national disease control programmes. However, traditional 
statistical approaches may miss important features of BVD epidemiology due to 
the highly correlated nature of many farm-level risk factors. In this 
cross-sectional study, we used data collected from 304 cattle herds in New 
Zealand during 2015/2016 to compare the results from multivariable logistic 
regression with Bayesian network (BN) analysis. Blood samples from 15 heifers 
from each farm were pooled and analysed with an antibody ELISA test to classify 
BVD virus exposure status. Farmers were surveyed about their general management 
practices, knowledge about BVD, and risk factors for disease transmission, 
including onto- and off-farm movements, within- and between-farm contacts, and 
whether they implemented BVD control measures for their service bulls. Multiple 
imputation was used to infer missing values in the dataset prior to statistical 
analysis. The results showed that 57/116 (49.1%) beef farms and 95/188 (50.5%) 
dairy farms were likely to be actively infected with BVD virus. Almost 60% of 
farms had movements of heifers/cows onto the premises and 13.8% of farmers 
reported contact with cattle from other farms. The results of the multivariable 
logistic regression showed that farms where heifers/cows had been moved onto the 
premises during all or most of the past five years were at higher risk of being 
BVD seropositive than farms without those movements (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.29-4.24). 
Farms where cattle had occasional or rare contacts with cattle on other farms 
were also at increased risk compared with farms without any animal contacts 
between farms (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.33-5.41) although this association was not 
frequency-dependent. Only close animal contacts between farms was directly 
associated with BVD status in the BN model, however, this approach further 
untangled other complex associations between correlated management factors, and 
provided additional important insights into BVD epidemiology. Compared to other 
countries with intensive production systems, over the fence contact appeared to 
play a more important role in New Zealand pastoral-based production systems and 
should be considered when developing strategies for a national BVD control 
programme.

            <jats:italic>Norovirus</jats:italic>
            genogroup III and genotype 2 (GIII/2) and were genetically distinct from human
            <jats:italic>Norovirus</jats:italic>
            GI and GII. Six BECVs had capsid gene sequences similar to that of the unclassified Nebraska (NB)-like BECV. The 15 bovine noroviruses (BoNVs) were more closely related to Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (GIII/2) and other known genotype 2 BoNVs than to genotype 1 Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE. The BoNV Bo/CV521-OH/02/US showed high nucleotide and amino acid identities (84 and 94%, respectively) with the capsid gene of Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK, whereas the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the RNA polymerase gene were more closely related to those of Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE (77 and 87% identities, respectively) than to those of Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (69 and 69% identities, respectively), suggesting that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US is a genotype 1-2 recombinant. Gene conversion analysis by the recombinant identification program and SimPlot also predicted that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US was a recombinant. Six NB-like BECVs shared 88 to 92% nucleotide and 94 to 99.5% amino acid identities with the NB BECV in the capsid gene. The results of this study demonstrate genetic diversity in the capsid genes of BECVs circulating in Ohio veal calves, provide new data for coinfections with distinct BECV genotypes or genogroups, and describe the first natural BoNV genotype 1-2 recombinant, analogous to the previously reported human norovirus recombinants.

The Norwegian muskox (Ovibos moschatus) population lives on the high mountain 
plateau of Dovre and originates from animals introduced from Greenland. In the 
late summers of 2006 and 2012, severe outbreaks of pneumonia with mortality 
rates of 25-30% occurred. During the 2012 epidemic high quality samples from 
culled sick animals were obtained for microbiological and pathological 
examinations. High throughput sequencing (pyrosequencing) of pneumonic lung 
tissue revealed high concentrations of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae in all six 
animals examined by this method and Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida in 
four animals, whereas no virus sequences could be identified. Mycoplasma 
ovipneumoniae and P. multocida multocida were also isolated by culture. Using 
real time PCR on lung swabs, M. ovipneumoniae was detected in all of the 19 
pneumonic lungs examined. Gross pathological examination revealed heavy 
consolidations primarily in the cranial parts of the lungs and it also 
identified one case of otitis media. Histologically, lung lesions were 
characterized as acute to subacute mixed exudative and moderately proliferative 
bronchoalveolar pneumonia. Immunohistochemical (IHC) examination revealed high 
load of M. ovipneumoniae antigens within lung lesions, with particularly 
intensive staining in the neutrophils. Similar IHC finding were observed in 
archived lung tissue blocks from animals examined during the 2006 epidemic. An 
M. ovipneumoniae specific ELISA was applied on bio-banked muskox sera from stray 
muskoxen killed in the period 2004-2013 and sick muskoxen culled, as well as 
sera from wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) on Dovre and muskoxen from 
Greenland. Serology and mycoplasma culturing was also carried out on sheep that 
had been on pasture in the muskox area during the outbreak in 2012. Our findings 
indicated separate introductions of M. ovipneumoniae infection in 2006 and 2012 
from infected co-grazing sheep. Salt licks shared by the two species were a 
possible route of transmitting infection.

Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea in Europe: In-Detail Analyses of Disease Dynamics and Molecular Epidemiology,"<jats:p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease of swine caused by the eponymous virus (PEDV) which belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae virus family. Following the disastrous outbreaks in Asia and the United States, PEDV has been detected also in Europe. In order to better understand the overall situation, the molecular epidemiology, and factors that might influence the most variable disease impact; 40 samples from swine feces were collected from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries and sequenced by shot-gun next-generation sequencing. A total of 38 new PEDV complete coding sequences were generated. When compared on a global scale, all investigated sequences from Central and South-Eastern Europe formed a rather homogeneous PEDV S INDEL cluster, suggesting a recent re-introduction. However, in-detail analyses revealed two new clusters and putative ancestor strains. Based on the available background data, correlations between clusters and location, farm type or clinical presentation could not be established. Additionally, the impact of secondary infections was explored using the metagenomic data sets. While several coinfections were observed, no correlation was found with disease courses. However, in addition to the PEDV genomes, ten complete viral coding sequences from nine different data sets were reconstructed each representing new virus strains. In detail, three pasivirus A strains, two astroviruses, a porcine sapelovirus, a kobuvirus, a porcine torovirus, a posavirus, and an enterobacteria phage were almost fully sequenced.</jats:p>",0

Outbreaks of zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock are not uncommon, and an 
important component in containment of such emerging viral diseases is rapid and 
reliable diagnostics. Such methods are often PCR-based and hence require the 
availability of sequence data from the pathogen. Rattus norvegicus (R. 
norvegicus) is a known reservoir for important zoonotic pathogens. Transmission 
may be direct via contact with the animal, for example, through exposure to its 
faecal matter, or indirectly mediated by arthropod vectors. Here we investigated 
the viral content in rat faecal matter (n=29) collected from two continents by 
analyzing 2.2 billion next-generation sequencing reads derived from both DNA and 
RNA. Among other virus families, we found sequences from members of the 
Picornaviridae to be abundant in the microbiome of all the samples. Here we 
describe the diversity of the picornavirus-like contigs including 
near-full-length genomes closely related to the Boone cardiovirus and Theiler's 
encephalomyelitis virus. From this study, we conclude that picornaviruses within 
R. norvegicus are more diverse than previously recognized. The virome of R. 
norvegicus should be investigated further to assess the full potential for 
zoonotic virus transmission.

SaV is a causative agent of gastroenteritis in children and adults. SaV can be divided into five genogroups (GI–GV), among which GI, GII, GIV and GV are known to infect humans, whereas SaV GIII infects porcine species. Detection methods include ELISA, RT‐PCR and real‐time RT‐PCR. Since few SaV studies have been conducted, it is difficult to draw correlations between or conclusions about rates of incidence, detection and overall prevalence. Nevertheless, most studies agree that SaV infection is more frequent in young children than adults and that infection in children almost always occurs by 5 years of age. In addition, children at day‐care centres and institutions are at greatest risk of SaV‐associated infection and transmission. Recently, a number of important findings concerning human SaV were discovered. SaV strains were detected in water samples, which included untreated wastewater specimens, treated wastewater samples and river samples. SaV strains were also detected in shellfish samples destined for human consumption, and recombinant SaV strains were identified in a number of different countries. The purpose of this review was to highlight the current knowledge of human SaV, which appears to be an increasingly important virus causing gastroenteritis in humans.

In this study, a novel parvovirus (strain swine/Zsana3/2013/HUN, KT965075) was 
detected in domestic pigs and genetically characterized by viral metagenomics 
and PCR methods. The novel parvovirus was distantly related to the human 
bufaviruses and was detected in 19 (90.5 %) of the 21 and five (33.3 %) of the 
15 faecal samples collected from animals with and without cases of posterior 
paraplegia of unknown etiology from five affected farms and one control farm in 
Hungary, respectively. Swine/Zsana3/2013/HUN is highly prevalent in domestic 
pigs and potentially represents a novel parvovirus species in the subfamily 
Parvovirinae.

A cloned egg drop syndrome (EDS) virus genomic DNA fragment containing the 
protease gene has been identified and the complete nucleotide sequence of the 
protease and partial nucleotide sequence of the hexon genes has been determined. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the protease gene has revealed EDS virus to be 
genetically more closely related to bovine adenovirus type 7 (BAV-7) and ovine 
adenovirus isolate 287 (OAV287) than either of these two viruses are to other 
members of the genus Mastadenovirus or EDS virus is to an other member of the 
Aviadenovirus genus. The three viruses share further similarities in that they 
have a high percentage AT content in their genome and are characterized by 
having more compact genomes than other adenoviruses. The protease gene from all 
three viruses contained the active site residues (H55-D72-C122 triad) and C104 
(providing a disulfide bond to cofactor pVIc). However, P137, found in all other 
members of the Mastadenovirus genus, and thought to be involved in trafficking, 
was missing from the protease of the EDS virus, BAV-7, and OAV287. These results 
suggest that EDS virus should be classified along with BAV-7 and OAV287 in a 
separate taxon.

"The Strange, Expanding World of Animal Hepaciviruses","<jats:p> Hepaciviruses and pegiviruses constitute two closely related sister genera of the family Flaviviridae. In the past five years, the known phylogenetic diversity of the hepacivirus genera has absolutely exploded. What was once an isolated infection in humans (and possibly other primates) has now expanded to include horses, rodents, bats, colobus monkeys, cows, and, most recently, catsharks, shedding new light on the genetic diversity and host range of hepaciviruses. Interestingly, despite the identification of these many animal and primate hepaciviruses, the equine hepaciviruses remain the closest genetic relatives of the human hepaciviruses, providing an intriguing clue to the zoonotic source of hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes the significance of these studies and discusses current thinking about the origin and evolution of the animal hepaciviruses as well as their potential usage as surrogate models for the study of hepatitis C virus. </jats:p>",0

The Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV) is the first symbiotic 
EPV described from a parasitic wasp. The DlEPV is introduced into the tephritid 
fruit fly larval host along with the wasp egg at oviposition. We sequenced a 
shotgun genomic library of the DlEPV DNA and analyzed and compared the predicted 
protein sequences of eight ORFs with those of selected poxviruses and other 
organisms. BlastP searches showed that five of these are homologous to poxvirus 
putative proteins such as metalloprotease, a putative membrane protein, late 
transcription factor-3, virion surface protein, and poly (A) polymerase (PAP) 
regulatory small subunit. Three of these are similar to those of other organisms 
such as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) of Arabidopsis thaliana, eukaryotic 
initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) of Caenorhabditis briggsae and lambda phage 
integrase (lambda-Int) of Enterococcus faecium. Transcription motifs for early 
(TGA,A/T,XXXXA) or late (TAAATG, TAAT, or TAAAT) gene expression conserved in 
poxviruses were identified with those ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple 
alignments of five ORFs and 20 poxvirus homologous sequences and of a 
concatenate of multiple alignments suggested that DlEPV probably diverged from 
the ancestral node between the fowlpox virus and the genus B, lepidopteran and 
orthopteran EPVs, to which Amsacta moorei and Melanoplus sanguinipes EPV, 
respectively, belong. The DlEPV putative GGT, eIF4A, and lambda-Int contained 
many conserved domains that typified these proteins. These homologues may be 
involved in either viral pathogenicity or enhancing parasitism via the 
gamma-glutamyl cycle and compensation of eIF4A levels in the parasitized fly, or 
via the integration of a portion of the viral genome into the wasp and/or 
parasitized fly.

Newcastle disease (ND) is a serious neurological and respiratory disease of 
poultry that affects all types of birds but has traditionally not caused 
symptoms in wild aquatic birds, the natural hosts. In the late 1990s, a new 
genotype, viz. 5d that is pathogenic to all types of birds, including waterfowl, 
arose in China and has since spread from East Asia into parts of Europe, the 
Middle East and Africa. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the fusion 
protein gene of isolates obtained from outbreaks of ND in Sudan and found that 
all contemporary strains isolated between 2003 and 2006 were of genotype 5d, 
containing the virulent fusion protein cleavage site (F0) motif 
(112)RRQKRF(117). Introduction via a Middle Eastern trade partner is likely to 
be the source of infection since phylogenetic analysis excluded the possibility 
of introduction from western and southern Africa.

"Transmission patterns of human enterovirus 71 to, from and among European countries, 2003 to 2013","<jats:p>Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is involved in epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and has been reported to occur with severe neurological complications in eastern and south-east Asia. In other geographical areas, the transmission of this virus is poorly understood. We used large sequence datasets (of the gene encoding the viral protein 1, VP1) and a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to compare the molecular epidemiology and geographical spread patterns of EV-71 subgenogroups B4, B5, C1, C2, and C4 in Europe relative to other parts of the world. For the study, European countries considered were European Union (EU) Member States and Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  Viruses of the B4, B5, and C4 subgenogroups circulate mainly in eastern and south-east Asia. In Europe sporadic introductions of these subgenogroups are observed, however C1 and C2 viruses predominate. The phylogenies showed evidence of multiple events of spread involving C1 and C2 viruses within Europe since the mid-1990s. Two waves of sporadic C2 infections also occurred in 2010 and 2013. The 2007 Dutch outbreak caused by C2 and the occurrence of B5 and C4 infections in the EU between 2004 and 2013 arose while the circulation of C1 viruses was low. A transmission chain involving a C4 virus was traced from Japan to the EU and then further to Canada between 2001 and 2006. Recent events whereby spread of viruses have occurred from, to, and within Europe appear to be involved in the long term survival of EV-71, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance of this virus.</jats:p>",0

A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for avian leukosis 
virus (ALV) was developed for the detection of contamination of vaccines 
produced in embryonated eggs and cell cultures derived from chicken. ALV is 
highly pathogenic and induces a wide spectrum of disease in infected animals. 
ALV can be divided into five subgroups (A-E). The envelope glycoprotein (env 
gp85) is the main antigen determinant and responsible for subgroup 
classification. Viral RNA of all subgroups (A-E) was isolated and amplified 
using three sets of primers. Subsequently, restriction endonuclease analysis 
confirmed the product identity and discriminated between subgroups. In specific 
pathogen free (SPF) eggs experimentally inoculated with ALV, viral RNA was found 
in allantoic fluids, as well as in vaccines spiked with different subgroups of 
ALV. No adventitious virus was detected in commercially available preparations. 
This system provides a rapid and specific in vitro method for the detection of 
ALV RNA as an extraneous agent and may be applied for quality control of avian 
vaccines.

Bovine rhinitis viruses (BRV) are established etiological agents of bovine 
respiratory disease complex however little research into their epidemiology and 
ecology has been published for several decades. In the U.S., only bovine 
rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) has been identified while bovine rhinitis A virus 2 
(BRAV2) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) were previously only identified in 
England and Japan, respectively. Metagenomic sequencing of a nasal swab from a 
bovine respiratory disease (BRD) diagnostic submission from Kansas identified 
contigs with approximately 90% nucleotide similarity to BRAV2 and BRBV. A 
combination of de novo and templated assemblies using reference genomes yielded 
near complete BRAV2 and BRBV genomes. The near complete genome of bovine 
rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) was also determined from a historical isolate to 
enable further molecular epidemiological studies. A 5'-nuclease reverse 
transcription PCR assay targeting the 3D polymerase gene was designed and used 
to screen 204 archived BRD clinical specimens. Thirteen (6.4%) were positive. 
Metagenomic sequencing of six positive samples identified mixed BRAV1/BRAV2, 
BRAV1/BRBV and BRAV2/BRBV infections for five samples. One sample showed 
infection only with BRAV1. Seroprevalence studies using a cell culture adapted 
BRBV found immunofluorescence assay-reactive antibodies were common in the herds 
analyzed. Altogether, these results demonstrate that BRV infections are common 
in cattle with respiratory disease and that BRAV1, BRAV2 and BRBV co-circulate 
in U.S. cattle and have high similarity to viruses isolated more than 30 years 
ago from diverse locations.

          <jats:p>
            We have recently reported the isolation of a novel virus, provisionally designated C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK), with 50% overall homology to human influenza C viruses (ICV), from a pig in Oklahoma. Deep RNA sequencing of C/OK virus found a matrix 1 (M1) protein expression strategy that differed from that of ICV. The novelty of C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether C/OK virus could exist in a nonswine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in U.S. bovine herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether swine/bovine C/OK viruses can undergo reassortment with human ICV, and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK,
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            reassortment and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were conducted.
            <jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic>
            reassortment using two human ICV and two swine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent split virions was observed in AGID between human and nonhuman viruses by using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive to cognate antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV. The classification of the new virus in a separate genus of the
            <jats:italic>Orthomyxoviridae</jats:italic>
            family is proposed. The finding of C/OK virus in swine and bovine indicates that this new virus may spread and establish infection in other mammals, including humans.

            Influenza C viruses (ICV) are common human pathogens, infecting most people during childhood and adolescence, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms. While ICV have been isolated from both pigs and dogs, humans are thought to be the natural viral reservoir. Previously, we characterized an ICV-like virus isolated from pigs exhibiting symptoms of influenza virus-like illness. Here, we show molecular and serological data demonstrating widespread circulation of similar viruses in bovines. Deep RNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            reassortment experiments demonstrate that animal ICV-like viruses are genetically distinct from human ICV. Antigenically, we show that ICV-like viruses are not recognized by ICV antibodies. En masse, these results suggest that bovine influenza virus warrants classification as a new genus of influenza virus. The finding of this novel virus that can infect multiple mammalian species warrants further research into its role in human health.

Pestiviruses are some of the most significant pathogens affecting ruminants and 
swine. Here, we assembled a 11 276 bp contig encoding a predicted 3635 aa 
polyprotein from porcine serum with 68 % pairwise identity to that of a recently 
partially characterized Rhinolophus affinis pestivirus (RaPV) and approximately 
25-28 % pairwise identity to those of other pestiviruses. The virus was 
provisionally named atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV). Metagenomic sequencing 
of 182 serum samples identified four additional APPV-positive samples. Positive 
samples originated from five states and ELISAs using recombinant APPV Erns found 
cross-reactive antibodies in 94 % of a collection of porcine serum samples, 
suggesting widespread distribution of APPV in the US swine herd. The molecular 
and serological results suggest that APPV is a novel, highly divergent porcine 
pestivirus widely distributed in US pigs.

De novo assembly of metagenomic sequencing reads from feces from a clinically 
normal pig identified two approximately 9 kb contigs which each consisted of a 
single large open reading frame. While one contig encoded a predicted 2990 amino 
acid protein with 83 % identity to the recently described posavirus 1, the other 
contig encoded a predicted 2942 amino acid protein with only 25 % identity 
limited to the genomic region encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 
of posavirus 2. Besides RdRp, search of the conserved domain database identified 
domains associated with picornavirus capsid proteins but failed to identify 
picornaviral helicase and proteinase domains. In addition, a domain representing 
a family of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma immunoglobulin-blocking virulence proteins 
was identified near the 5'-terminus. Phylogenetic analysis found a distant 
relationship between this novel virus, provisionally named posavirus 3, to the 
unclassified posaviruses and fisavirus which are proposed to represent different 
genera in a novel family of the Picornavirales.

Feral swine are known reservoirs for various pathogens that can adversely affect 
domestic animals. To assess the viral ecology of feral swine in the USA, 
metagenomic sequencing was performed on 100 pooled nasal swabs. The virome was 
dominated by small, ssDNA viruses belonging to the families Circoviridae, 
Anelloviridae and Parvovirinae. Only four RNA viruses were identified: porcine 
kobuvirus, porcine sapelovirus, atypical porcine pestivirus and a novel 
Orthopneumovirus, provisionally named swine orthopneumovirus (SOV). SOV shared 
~90 % nucleotide identity to murine pneumonia virus (MPV) and canine 
pneumovirus. A modified, commercially available ELISA for MPV found that 
approximately 30 % of both feral and domestic swine sera were positive for 
antibodies cross-reactive with MPV. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR 
identified two (2 %) and four (5.0 %) positive nasal swab pools from feral and 
domestic swine, respectively, confirming that SOV circulates in both herds.

Posaviruses are a group of highly divergent viruses identified in swine faeces 
that are distantly related to other members of the order Picornavirales. 
Eighteen posavirus genomes were assembled from 10 out of 25 (40 %) faecal-swab 
pools collected from healthy adult swine. Phylogenetic analysis of the conserved 
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) domain found that posaviruses form a large, 
highly diverse, monophyletic clade, which includes similar viruses identified in 
human (husavirus) and fish (fisavirus) faeces or intestinal contents, 
respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis of water samples 
collected from commercial swine barns identified four out of 19 (21 %) samples 
were positive using a 5'-nuclease assay targeting the Pol region of posavirus 1. 
ICPD (immunoprecipitation coupled to PCR detection) assays to explore 
serological evidence of posavirus infection found only a single positive sample, 
suggesting posaviruses do not commonly infect swine, and together these results 
suggests a likely aquatic host.

Parapoxviruses (PPV), of the family Poxviridae, cause a pustular cutaneous 
disease in sheep and goats (orf virus, ORFV) and cattle (pseudocowpoxvirus, PCPV 
and bovine papular stomatitis virus, BPSV). Here, we present the first genomic 
sequence of a reference strain of PCPV (VR634) along with the genomic sequence 
of a PPV (F00.120R) isolated in Finland from reindeer (Rangifer tarandus 
tarandus). The F00.120R and VR634 genomes are 135 and 145 kb in length and 
contain 131 and 134 putative genes, respectively, with their genome organization 
being similar to that of other PPVs. The predicted proteins of F00.120R and 
VR634 have an average amino acid sequence identity of over 95%, whereas they 
share only 88 and 73% amino acid identity with the ORFV and BPSV proteomes, 
respectively. The most notable differences were found near the genome termini. 
F00.120R lacks six and VR634 lacks three genes seen near the right terminus of 
other PPVs. Four genes at the left end of F00.120R and one in the middle of both 
genomes appear to be fragmented paralogues of other genes within the genome. 
VR634 has larger than expected inverted terminal repeats possibly as a result of 
genomic rearrangements. The high G+C content (64%) of these two viruses along 
with amino acid sequence comparisons and whole genome phylogenetic analyses 
confirm the classification of PCPV as a separate species within the genus 
Parapoxvirus and verify that the virus responsible for an outbreak of contagious 
stomatitis in reindeer over the winter of 1999-2000 can be classified as PCPV.

            <jats:p>The bacterium <jats:italic>Salmonella enterica</jats:italic> serovar Typhimurium (<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>. Typhimurium) is one of the most frequent causes of foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Between 2005–2008 a series of <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>. Typhimurium outbreaks occurred in Tasmania, Australia, that were all traced to eggs originating from a single chicken farm. We sequenced the genomes of 12 isolates linked to these outbreaks, in order to investigate the microevolution of a pathogenic <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>.

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The isolates, which shared a phage type similar to DT135 known locally as 135@ or 135a, formed a clade within the <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>.

Ten of the isolates belonged to a single clone (&lt;23 SNPs between isolate pairs) which likely represents the population of <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>. Typhimurium circulating at the chicken farm; the other two were from sporadic cases and were genetically distinct from this clone. Divergence dating indicated that all 12 isolates diverged from a common ancestor in the mid 1990s, and the clone began to diversify in 2003–2004. This clone spilled out into the human population several times between 2005–2008, during which time it continued to accumulate SNPs at a constant rate of 3–5 SNPs per year or 1x10<jats:sup>-6</jats:sup> substitutions site<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> year<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, faster than the longer-term (~50 year) rates estimated previously for <jats:italic>S.</jats:italic> Typhimurium. Our data suggest that roughly half of non-synonymous substitutions are rapidly removed from the <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>. Typhimurium population, after which purifying selection is no longer important and the remaining substitutions become fixed in the population. The <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>. Typhimurium 135@ isolates were nearly identical to SL1344 in terms of gene content and virulence plasmids. Their phage contents were close to SL1344, except that they carried a different variant of Gifsy-1, lacked the P2 remnant found in SL1344 and carried a novel P2 phage, P2-Hawk, in place SL1344’s P2 phage SopEϕ. DT135 lacks P2 prophage. Two additional plasmids were identified in the <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>. Typhimurium 135@ isolates, pSTM2 and pSTM7. Both plasmids were IncI1, but phylogenetic analysis of the plasmids and their bacterial hosts shows these plasmids are genetically distinct and result from independent plasmid acquisition events.</jats:p>

Bovine rotavirus B (RVB) is an etiological agent of diarrhea mostly in adult 
cattle. Currently, a few sequences of viral protein (VP)1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 and 
nonstructural protein (NSP)1, 2, and 5 of bovine RVB are available in the 
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases, and none have been reported for VP3, NSP3, and 
NSP4. In order to fill this gap in the genetic characterization of bovine RVB 
strains, we used a metagenomics approach and sequenced and analyzed the complete 
coding sequences (CDS) of VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 genes, as well as the partial or 
complete CDS of other genes of RVBs detected from Japanese cattle. VP3, NSP3, 
and NSP4 of bovine RVBs shared low nucleotide sequence identities (63.3-64.9% 
for VP3, 65.9-68.2% for NSP3, and 52.6-56.2% for NSP4) with those of murine, 
human, and porcine RVBs, suggesting that bovine RVBs belong to a novel genotype. 
Furthermore, significantly low amino acid sequence identities were observed for 
NSP4 (36.1-39.3%) between bovine RVBs and the RVBs of other species. In 
contrast, hydrophobic plot analysis of NSP4 revealed profiles similar to those 
of RVBs of other species and rotavirus A (RVA) strains. Phylogenetic analyses of 
all gene segments revealed that bovine RVB strains formed a cluster that 
branched distantly from other RVBs. These results suggest that bovine RVBs have 
evolved independently from other RVBs but in a similar manner to other 
rotaviruses. These findings provide insights into the evolution and diversity of 
RVB strains.

The HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies for T 
cell line adapted-HIV-1, but less so for primary isolates. We hypothesized that 
peptides representative of the diversity of natural HIV-1 V3 loop variants might 
capture elements of conserved higher order structures and so stimulate broadly 
reactive neutralizing antibodies. We designed a panel of 29 subtype B V3 
sequences postulated to reflect the range of V3 diversity. These peptides were 
used to immunize guinea pigs. The most effective peptide (62.19) clustered 
around the subtype B consensus sequence and induced antibodies that reproducibly 
neutralized 31% of the subtype B HIV-1 primary isolates evaluated, but exhibited 
limited cross-neutralization of non-subtype B HIV-1 strains. Taken together, 
these data demonstrated that the limited neutralization profile of antibodies 
induced by optimal subtype B V3 motifs likely represents the maximum breadth of 
neutralization of subtype B HIV-1 primary isolates attainable by anti-V3 peptide 
antibodies.

"Group A Rotaviruses in Chinese Bats: Genetic Composition, Serology, and Evidence for Bat-to-Human Transmission and Reassortment","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Bats are natural reservoirs for many pathogenic viruses, and increasing evidence supports the notion that bats can also harbor group A rotaviruses (RVAs), important causative agents of diarrhea in children and young animals. Currently, 8 RVA strains possessing completely novel genotype constellations or genotypes possibly originating from other mammals have been identified from African and Chinese bats. However, all the data were mainly based on detection of RVA RNA, present only during acute infections, which does not permit assessment of the true exposure of a bat population to RVA. To systematically investigate the genetic diversity of RVAs, 547 bat anal swabs or gut samples along with 448 bat sera were collected from five South Chinese provinces. Specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening found four RVA strains. Strain GLRL1 possessed a completely novel genotype constellation, whereas the other three possessed a constellation consistent with the MSLH14-like genotype, a newly characterized group of viruses widely prevalent in Chinese insectivorous bats. Among the latter, strain LZHP2 provided strong evidence of cross-species transmission of RVAs from bats to humans, whereas strains YSSK5 and BSTM70 were likely reassortants between typical MSLH14-like RVAs and human RVAs. RVA-specific antibodies were detected in 10.7% (48/448) of bat sera by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). Bats in Guangxi and Yunnan had a higher RVA-specific antibody prevalence than those from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. These observations provide evidence for cross-species transmission of MSLH14-like bat RVAs to humans, highlighting the impact of bats as reservoirs of RVAs on public health.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Bat viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses, are important pathogens causing outbreaks of severe emerging infectious diseases. However, little is known about bat viruses capable of causing gastroenteritis in humans, even though 8 group A viruses (RVAs) have been identified from bats so far. In this study, another 4 RVA strains were identified, with one providing strong evidence for zoonotic transmission from bats to humans. Serological investigation has also indicated that RVA infection in bats is far more prevalent than expected based on the detection of viral RNA.

Characterization of a Novel G3P[3] Rotavirus Isolated from a Lesser Horseshoe Bat: a Distant Relative of Feline/Canine Rotaviruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bats are considered important animal reservoirs for many viruses pathogenic to humans. An approach based on viral metagenomics was used to study gut specimens from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. Seventy-four reads were found to be related to group A rotavirus (RVA). Further reverse transcription-PCR screening and viral isolation on cell cultures confirmed the presence of a novel RVA strain, named RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3], in 1 (6%) of 16 lesser horseshoe bats. Full genomic sequencing analyses showed that MSLH14 possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which is akin to human and animal rotaviruses believed to be of feline/canine origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VP7 was most closely related to bovine RVA strains from India, whereas VP4 was most closely related to an unusual human RVA strain, CMH222, with animal characteristics isolated in Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a range of animal RVA strains, most of which are believed to be related to feline/canine RVAs. Experimental infection showed that bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic to suckling mice, causing 100% mortality when they were inoculated orally with a titer as low as 5 × 10
            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>
            50% tissue culture infective doses. As this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strain, it is tempting to speculate that it is a true bat RVA strain rather than a virus transmitted between species. However, further screening of bat populations, preferably juvenile animals, will be crucial in determining whether or not this virus is widely distributed in the bat population.

DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) mark diverse classes of cis-regulatory 
regions, such as promoters and enhancers. MSB-1 derived from chicken Marek's 
disease (MD) lymphomas is an MDV-transformed CD4+ T-cell line for MD study. 
Previously, DNase I HS sites were studied mainly in human cell types for 
mammalian. To capture the regulatory elements specific to MSB1 cells and explore 
the molecular mechanisms of T-cell transformation caused by MDV in MD, we 
generated high-quality of DHSs map and gene expression profile for functional 
analysis in MSB1 cell line. The total of 21,724 significant peaks of DHSs was 
identified from around 40 million short reads. DHSs distribution varied between 
chromosomes and they preferred to enrich in the gene-rich chromosomes. More 
interesting, DHSs enrichments appeared to be scarce on regions abundant in CpG 
islands. Besides, we integrated DHSs into the gene expression data and found 
that DHSs tended to enrich on high expressed genes throughout whole gene regions 
while DHSs did not show significant changes for low and silent expressed genes. 
Furthermore, the correlation of DHSs with lincRNAs expression was also 
calculated and it implied that enhancer-associated lincRNAs probably originated 
from enhancer-like regions of DHSs. Together, our results indicated that DNase I 
HS sites highly correlate with active genes expression in MSB1 cells, suggesting 
DHSs can be considered as markers to identify the cis-regulatory elements 
associated with chicken Marek's disease.

BACKGROUND: Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) are highly contagious and cause 
disease in both wild birds and poultry. A pigeon-adapted variant of genotype VI 
NDV, often termed pigeon paramyxovirus 1, is commonly isolated from columbids in 
the United States and worldwide. Complete genomic characterization of these 
genotype VI viruses circulating in wild columbids in the United States is 
limited, and due to the genetic variability of the virus, failure of rapid 
diagnostic detection has been reported. Therefore, in this study, formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were subjected to next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) to identify and characterize these circulating viruses, providing valuable 
genetic information. NGS enables multiple samples to be deep-sequenced in 
parallel. When used on FFPE samples, this methodology allows for retrospective 
studies of infectious organisms.
METHODS: FFPE wild pigeon tissue samples (kidney, liver and spleen) from 10 
mortality events in the U.S. between 2010 and 2016 were analyzed using NGS to 
detect and sequence NDV genomes from randomly amplified total RNA. Results were 
compared to the previously published immunohistochemistry (IHC) results 
conducted on the same samples. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses were 
conducted on the complete and partial fusion gene and complete genome coding 
sequences.
RESULTS: Twenty-three out of 29 IHC-positive FFPE pigeon samples were identified 
as positive for NDV by NGS. Positive samples produced an average genome coverage 
of 99.6% and an average median depth of 199. A previously described sub-genotype 
(VIa) and a novel sub-genotype (VIn) of NDV were identified as the causative 
agent of 10 pigeon mortality events in the U.S. from 2010 to 2016. The 
distribution of these viruses from the North American lineages match the 
distribution of the Eurasian collared-doves and rock pigeons in the U.S.
CONCLUSIONS: This work reports the first successful evolutionary study using 
deep sequencing of complete NDV genomes from FFPE samples of wild bird origin. 
There are at least two distinct U.S. lineages of genotype VI NDV maintained in 
wild pigeons that are continuously evolving independently from each other and 
have no evident epidemiological connections to viruses circulating abroad. These 
findings support the hypothesis that columbids are serving as reservoirs of 
virulent NDV in the U.S.

Electrostatic Variation of Haemagglutinin as a Hallmark of the Evolution of Avian Influenza Viruses,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Avian influenza virus is a zoonotic agent that significantly impacts public health and the poultry industry. Monitoring viral evolution and spread is crucial for surveillance and tracing programmes, which are currently based on serological or DNA sequencing-phylogenetics analysis. However, virus-host interactions, antigenic drift and spreading of viral clades strongly depend on variation in the surface features of capsid proteins. We report here that <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic> comparative structural analysis of haemagglutinin can reveal relevant evolutionary fingerprints, particularly when integrated with sequence-based analyses. Phylogenetic analyses of H9 viral strains from wild birds and poultry, performed with different methods, reliably led to clustering of viruses into five main groups. Subsequent comparison of structural features showed congruence between such clustering and surface electrostatic fingerprints. These latter fingerprints relate group-specific variations in electrostatic charges and isocontours to well-known haemagglutinin sites involved in the modulation of immune escape and host specificity. This work suggests that the integration of structural and sequence comparisons may enhance investigations of trends and relevant mechanisms in viral evolution.</jats:p>",0

Complete 1D gene sequences of 13 Indian foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type 
C field isolates and a vaccine strain (C-Bombay/64) were determined. All the 
field isolates showed a greater genetic homogeneity (95-100%) among themselves 
and were 19.7-21.2% divergent from the vaccine strain. In the phylogenetic 
analysis, the Indian field isolates formed a separate lineage (lineage VII) 
different from the previously identified six lineages (lineage I-VI) in type C 
FMDV [J. Virol. 66 (1992) 3557]. The vaccine strain was grouped with European 
lineage (lineage II). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of 
antigenic sites A and C of field isolates showed no significant variation from 
the vaccine strain. One-way serological relationship determined in ELISA showed 
antigenic closeness of the field isolates with C-Bombay/64.

In India, Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O has been associated 
with more than 75% of the outbreaks. Previous studies with this serotype have 
indicated that the viruses circulating in India belong to a single genotype. 
Recent (February 2001) FMD epidemics in Europe have focussed global attention on 
the source of the virus and have been traced to a strain, PanAsia (serotype O), 
which is present in India since 1990. In this study, to further characterize the 
isolates belonging to the PanAsian strain, we sequenced the complete 
VP1-encoding (1 D) gene for 71 FMDV serotype O isolates from India recovered 
from the field outbreaks during the last 4 decades (1962-2001). All the isolates 
in the tree were distributed in to three major branches (designated as A, B and 
C); the branch C is further divided into four groups (I-IV), of which the group 
IV belongs to the PanAsia strain. Furthermore, we show that the PanAsia strain 
has been circulating endemically since 1982 (not 1990 as reported earlier) and 
has been the most dominant outbreak strain in the recent years and distributed 
at least in 17 states of the country. During the year 2001, another new group 
(group III) of virus with genetic divergence of 5.4-11.1% at nucleotide level 
from the PanAsia strain is found to co-circulate endemically, and is slowly 
replacing it. At amino acid level this strain differed from PanAsia strain at 
five amino acid positions in the VP1. Although these strains are divergent at 
nucleotide level, they maintained a good antigenic relationship with one of the 
vaccine strains (IND R2/75) widely used in the country. Given the ability of the 
PanAsia virus to persist, spread and to outcompete other strains, the present 
trend could be of serious concern as the newly emerging virus is replacing it. 
If this is true, then there is another equally divergent strain as PanAsia that 
may pose a serious threat to the global dairy and meat industries.

Genetic analysis of foot-and-mouth disease virus type O isolates responsible for field outbreaks in India between 1993 and 1999,"<jats:p>Partial nucleotide sequence at the 3′ end of 1D (VP1-encoding) gene of 90 foot-and-mouth 
disease virus type O isolates recovered from field outbreaks in India between 1993–9 were 
determined. The sequences were compared with each other and reference viruses. The published 
sequences of 15 type O isolates recovered from different parts of Asia and one isolate (O1BFS) 
from Europe and one from Egypt (O1/Sharquia/Egypt/72) were also included in the analysis 
for comparison. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis the viruses could be grouped into four 
distinct genotypes (genotypes I–IV). All 90 isolates from India were genotype-I, as were the 
reference isolates from Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey. 
Genotype-I isolates were further subdivided into 16 sub-genotypes. The Indian isolates were 
found to be extremely heterogeneous in nature and clustered into 12 different genetic groups. 
In genotype-I, the nucleotide sequence difference seen between the isolates was 0–11·6%, while 
among the Indian isolates it is 0–8·8%. Viruses of similar genetic groups are circulating in 
India, Bangladesh and countries of the Middle East. Genotype-II and -III are represented by 
isolates from Lebanon (O1/South Lebanon) and Europe (O1-BFS), respectively. Genotype-IV 
is formed by isolates from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The present study reveals the 
occurrence of viruses belonging to multiple genetic groups over a short period of time and 
persistence of single genetic group in the same geographical area over several years. This is 
consistent with the endemic nature of the disease in the country.</jats:p>",0
"Metagenomic identification, seasonal dynamics, and potential transmission mechanisms of a <i>Daphnia</i>‐associated single‐stranded DNA virus in two temperate lakes","<jats:p>We used a metagenomic approach to identify viruses that may be involved in the ecology of <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> spp. in Oneida and Cayuga lakes (upstate New York). We identified several highly represented, putative eukaryotic, circular, single‐stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viral genomes. Among these, we discovered a genotype similar in both sequence and genomic architecture to a virus previously reported from a hyperthermal lake that shares characteristics of both single‐stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) and single‐stranded DNA viruses. We used quantitative polymerase chain reactions to study the prevalence and viral load of both positive‐sense and negative‐sense strands of the <jats:italic>Daphnia mendotae</jats:italic>‐associated (Cladocera) hybrid virus (DMClaHV) over a summer season in Oneida and Cayuga lakes. DMClaHV had high prevalence within <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> populations, where viral load and the proportion of virus‐positive individuals were higher preceding host population decline. DMClaHV viral load was different between two species of <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>D. mendotae</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>D. retrocurva</jats:italic>), and the dynamics between viruses and their hosts varied between the two lakes. We detected DMClaHV in eggs (ephippia) retrieved from Oneida Lake sediments with an estimated age of 30 yr. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed small (20 nm diameter) virus‐like particles in <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> that were well away from gut tissues and not associated with intracellular parasites. Because <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> plays a critical role in many lake ecosystems, DMClaHV may have important effects on herbivory and thus carbon flow through the lake ecosystem.</jats:p>",0

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFv) is a member of the genus 
Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. It possesses a tripartite, single 
stranded RNA genome of negative polarity consisting of large (L), medium (M) and 
small (S) segments. CCHF virus is enzootic in life stock and wild animals in 
many parts of the Middle East, Asia and Africa and is also recognised in 
Southeast Europe. Severe disease, manifest as haemorrhagic fever and high 
mortality rates (up to 50%), is only recognised in humans. We have determined 
the complete sequence of the small genomic RNA segment from several strains of 
CCHF virus from outbreaks in Pakistan 2000, Baghdad 1976 and Uzbekistan 1967. 
Phylogenetic analysis of three datasets of sequences from the small genomic RNA 
segment available from a range of strains indicates that they can be divided 
into seven subtypes. Superimposed on this pattern are links between distant 
geographic locations, pointing to the existence of a global reservoir of CCHFv. 
In some cases these links may originate from trade in livestock, and 
long-distance carriage of virus or infected ticks during bird migration.

The coat protein gene and part of the 3' non-coding region of five strains of 
peanut stripe virus (PStV) from Thailand have been cloned and sequenced. 
Phylogenetic comparisons of these strains, known as T1, T3, T5, T6 and T7, and 
related sequences showed that these strains are indeed strains of PStV. Further, 
PStV strains appear to be related to each other according to their geographic 
origin. That is, the Thai strains are more closely related to each other than 
they are to strains from the USA or Indonesia, despite the variety of symptoms 
caused by these strains and the overlap of symptom types between the strains 
from different locations. Like other PStV strains, PStV-Thai can be considered 
strains of bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) but can be distinguished from 
bean-infecting strains of BCMV and blackeye cowpea mosaic virus (B1CMV) through 
sequence and host range. No evidence was found that PStV-Thai strains, unlike 
PStV-Ib, are recombinants of PStV and B1CMV, although the T3 strain may be a 
recombinant of different PStV sequences. Phylogenetic analyses of viruses of the 
BCMV group suggest that acquisition of the ability to infect peanut may have 
occurred only once.

Transmission of influenza reflects seasonality of wild birds across the annual cycle,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Influenza A Viruses (IAV) in nature must overcome shifting transmission barriers caused by the mobility of their primary host, migratory wild birds, that change throughout the annual cycle. Using a phylogenetic network of viral sequences from North American wild birds (2008–2011) we demonstrate a shift from intraspecific to interspecific transmission that along with reassortment, allows IAV to achieve viral flow across successive seasons from summer to winter. Our study supports amplification of IAV during summer breeding seeded by overwintering virus persisting locally and virus introduced from a wide range of latitudes. As birds migrate from breeding sites to lower latitudes, they become involved in transmission networks with greater connectivity to other bird species, with interspecies transmission of reassortant viruses peaking during the winter. We propose that switching transmission dynamics may be a critical strategy for pathogens that infect mobile hosts inhabiting regions with strong seasonality.</jats:p>",0

The ecosystem of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract traverses a number of 
environmental, chemical, and physical conditions because it runs from the oral 
cavity to the anus. These differences in conditions along with food or other 
ingested substrates affect the composition and density of the microbiota as well 
as their functional roles by selecting those that are the most suitable for that 
environment. Previous studies have mostly focused on Bacteria, with the number 
of studies conducted on Archaea, Eukarya, and Viruses being limited despite 
their important roles in this ecosystem. Furthermore, due to the challenges 
associated with collecting samples directly from the inside of humans, many 
studies are still exploratory, with a primary focus on the composition of 
microbiomes. Thus, mechanistic studies to investigate functions are conducted 
using animal models. However, differences in physiology and microbiomes need to 
be clarified in order to aid in the translation of animal model findings into 
the context of humans. This review will highlight Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi, and 
Viruses, discuss differences along the GI tract of healthy humans, and perform 
comparisons with three common animal models: rats, mice, and pigs.

"TTV, a new human virus with single stranded circular DNA genome","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>TT virus (TTV) was found in 1997 from a hepatitis patient without virus markers. However, the real impact of TTV on liver diseases remains uncertain to date. Due to the lack of suitable cell systems to support the growth of TTV, the biology of TTV is still obscure. This review tries to summarise the current status of TTV on aspects other than the taxonomic diversity of TTV. TTV was the first human virus with a single stranded circular DNA genome. TTV was considered to be a member of <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, but others suggested it conformed to a new family. TTV is distinct from ambisense viruses in the genus <jats:italic>Circovirus</jats:italic>, since the former genome is negative stranded. The genome structure of TTV is more related to chicken anaemia virus in the genus <jats:italic>Gyrovirus</jats:italic>, however, the sequence similarity is minimal except for a short stretch at 3816–3851 of TA278. Currently the working group is proposing the full name for TTV as TorqueTenoVirus and the TTV‐like mini virus as TorqueTenoMiniVirus (TTMV) in a new genus <jats:italic>Anellovirus</jats:italic> (ring). TTVs are prevalent in non‐human primates and human TTV can cross‐infect chimpanzees. Furthermore, TTV sequences have been detected in chickens, pigs, cows and sheep. TTV can be transmitted by mother‐to‐child infection. However, within a year after birth, the prevalence reaches the same level for children born to both TTV‐positive and TTV‐negative mothers even without breast‐feeding. The non‐coding region surrounding a short 113 nt GC‐rich stretch and occupying approximately one‐third of the genome is considered to contain the putative replication origin. Three mRNAs are expressed by TTV, 3.0 and 1.2 and 1.0 kb species. A protein translated from the 3.0 kb mRNA is considered to be the major capsid protein as well as replicase. The nature of the proteins translated by the other two mRNAs are still putative. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",0
Torque teno virus (TTV): current status,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Torque teno virus (TTV), currently classified into the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, genus <jats:italic>Anellovirus,</jats:italic> was first found in a patient with non‐A‐E hepatitis. TTV has a single stranded circular DNA of ∼3.8 kb. TTVs are extraordinarily diverse, spanning five groups including SANBAN and SEN viruses. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) with ∼2.9 kb genome also has wide variants. Recently, two related 2.2‐ and 2.6‐kb species joined this community. Recombinations between variants are frequent. This extensive TTV diversity remains unexplained; it is unclear how TTVs could be viable, and why they require such genetic variation. An unequivocal culture system is still not available. TTVs are ubiquitous in &gt; 90% of adults worldwide but no human pathogenicity of TTV has been fully established. Epidemiological surveys need to specify the variants being studied and clinical targets, and must calibrate the sensitivity of the assay used. Potentially interesting observations include a higher viral load in patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, cancer and lupus. Active replication was also found in infants with acute respiratory diseases. TTV/TTMV‐related viruses were found in chimpanzees, apes, African monkeys and tupaias, and also in chickens, pigs, cows, sheep and dogs. Experimentally, rhesus monkeys were persistently infected by TTV, but only 1/53 chimpanzees. TTV transcribes three species of mRNAs, 3.0‐, 1.2‐ and 1.0‐kb in the ratio of 60:5:35. Recently, at least three mRNAs were shown in chicken anaemia virus. The genomic region −154/−76 contains a critical promoter. TTV seems to have at least three proteins; however, the definite functions of these proteins await further research work. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",0

This chapter examines the correlation between Torque teno virus (TTV) and 
chicken anemia virus (CAV). Each has a circular single-stranded (ss)DNA genome 
with every one of its known open reading frames (ORF) on its antigenomic strand. 
This structure is distinct from those of circoviruses. The genomic sizes of TTV 
and CAV are different, 3.8 kb and 2.3 kb, respectively. While the spectrum of 
the TTV genome is enormously diverse, that of the CAV genome is quite narrow. 
Although a 36-nt stretch near the replication origin of TA278 TTV possesses more 
than 80% similarity to that of CAV, the sequence of the other genomic regions 
does not exhibit a significant similarity. Nevertheless, the relative allocation 
of ORFs on each frame in these viruses mimics each other. Three or more 
messenger RNA (mRNAs) are generated by transcription in both of them. The 
structural protein with the replicase domain is coded for by frame 1 in each 
virus, and a nonstructural protein with a phosphatase domain is coded for by 
frame 2. A protein on frame 3 in each virus induces apoptosis in transformed 
cells. Recently, we confirmed that apoptin is necessary for the replication of 
CAV. TTV has been proposed to constitute a new family, Anelloviridae. 
Considering these similarities and dissimilarities between CAV and TTV, it seems 
more reasonable to place CAV, the only member of genus Gyrovirus, into 
Anelloviridae together with TTV, or into a new independent family.

Conservation of L and 3C proteinase activities across distantly related aphthoviruses,"<jats:p>The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader (L) proteinase is an important virulence determinant in FMDV infections. It possesses two distinct catalytic activities: (i) C-terminal processing at the L/VP4 junction; and (ii) induction of the cleavage of translation initiation factor eIF4G, an event that inhibits cap-dependent translation in infected cells. The only other member of the <jats:italic>Aphthovirus</jats:italic> genus, equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), also encodes an L protein, but this shares only 32% amino acid identity with its FMDV counterpart. Another more distantly related picornavirus, equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV), which is not classified as an aphthovirus, also encodes an L protein. Using <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> transcription and translation analysis, we have shown that both ERAV and ERBV L proteins have C-terminal processing activity. Furthermore, expression of ERAV L, but not ERBV L, in BHK-21 cells resulted in the efficient inhibition of cap-dependent translation in these cells. We have shown that the ERAV and FMDV L proteinases induce cleavage of eIF4GI at very similar or identical positions. Interestingly, ERAV 3C also induces eIF4GI cleavage and again produces distinct products that co-migrate with those induced by FMDV 3C. The ERBV L proteinase does not induce eIF4GI cleavage, consistent with its inability to shut down cap-dependent translation. We have also shown that another unique feature of FMDV L, the stimulation of enterovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity, is also shared by the ERAV L proteinase but not by ERBV L. The functional conservation of the divergent ERAV and FMDV proteinases indicates the likelihood of a similar and important role for these enzymes in the pathogenesis of infections caused by these distantly related aphthoviruses.</jats:p>",0

Studies of primate lentivirus phylogeny over the past decade have established a 
minimum of five related, but genetically distinct, groups of simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV), each originating from a different African primate 
species. The hypothesis that HIV-2 (and SIVmac) arose by cross-species 
transmission from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys has been strengthened by a 
more detailed characterization of the SIVsm/SIVmac/HIV-2 group of viruses. SIV 
from all four subspecies of African green monkeys (SIVagm) have been 
characterized with an apparent chimeric genome structure of SIVagm from West 
African green monkeys. Although these naturally infected primates remain 
healthy, cross-species transmission to other primate species may result in 
immunodeficiency, as caused by SIVsm infection of macaque monkeys (Macaca sp.) 
and recently, SIVagm infection of pig-tailed macaques (M. nemestrina). Studies 
of variation within infected individuals have been facilitated by adaptation of 
the techniques of heteroduplex analysis and single-stranded conformational 
polymorphism of PCR generated fragments.

THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE RECEPTORS OF A NEW STRAIN OF VIRUS TO THOSE OF THE MUMPS-NDV-INFLUENZA GROUP,"<jats:p>The interrelationships of the cellular receptors and the hemagglutinin inhibitors of a new strain of virus (1233) to members of the mumps-Newcastle disease-influenza group have been investigated. It was found that strain. 1233 does not destroy the receptors or inhibitors of the other group, nor does the latter destroy 1233 receptors or inhibitor. The sole exception to this statement was a moderate destruction of 1233 inhibitor in egg white by Newcastle disease virus. The classification of strain 1233 was discussed in the light of this evidence, evidence which tends to place strain 1233 in a different category from that of any other strain of the MNI group.</jats:p>",0

A neurological disease of young Pekin ducks characterized by ataxia, lameness, 
and paralysis was observed at several duck farms in Malaysia in 2012. Gross 
pathological lesions were absent or inconsistent in most of the cases, but 
severe and consistent microscopic lesions were found in the brain and spinal 
cord, characterized by non-purulent panencephalomyelitis. Several virus isolates 
were obtained in embryonated duck eggs and in cell cultures (Vero and DF-1) 
inoculated with the brain homogenates of affected ducks. After exclusion of 
other viruses, the isolates were identified as a flavivirus by 
flavivirus-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
assays. Inoculation of 2-week-old Pekin ducks with a flavivirus isolate by the 
subcutaneous or intramuscular route resulted in typical clinical signs and 
histological lesions in the brain and spinal cord. The inoculated virus was 
detected by RT-PCR from organ samples of ducks with clinical signs and 
histological lesions. With a few days delay, the disease was also observed among 
co-mingled contact control birds. Phylogenetic analysis of NS5 and E gene 
sequences proved that the isolates were representatives of a novel phylogenetic 
group within clade XI (Ntaya virus group) of the Flavivirus genus. This 
Malaysian Duck Tembusu Virus (DTMUV), named Perak virus, has moderate genomic 
RNA sequence similarity to a related DTMUV identified in China. In our 
experiment the Malaysian strain of DTMUV could be transmitted in the absence of 
mosquito vectors. These findings may have implications for the control and 
prevention of this emerging group of flaviviruses.

The high genetic variation of viruses of the genus Nairovirus reflects the diversity of their predominant tick hosts,"1. Virology. 2004 Jan 5;318(1):10-6. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2003.09.021.

for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.

The genus Nairovirus (family Bunyaviridae) contains seven serogroups consisting 
of 34 predominantly tick-borne viruses, including several associated with severe 
human and livestock diseases [e.g., Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and 
Nairobi sheep disease (NSD), respectively]. Before this report, no comparative 
genetic studies or molecular detection assays had been developed for this virus 
genus. To characterize at least one representative from each of the seven 
serogroups, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers 
targeting the L polymerase-encoding region of the RNA genome of these viruses 
were successfully designed based on conserved amino acid motifs present in the 
predicted catalytic core region. Sequence analysis showed the nairoviruses to be 
a highly diverse group, exhibiting up to 39.4% and 46.0% nucleotide and amino 
acid identity differences, respectively. Virus genetic relationships correlated 
well with serologic groupings and with tick host associations. Hosts of these 
viruses include both the hard (family Ixodidae) and soft (family Argasidae) 
ticks. Virus phylogenetic analysis reveals two major monophyletic groups: hard 
tick and soft tick-vectored viruses. In addition, viruses vectored by 
Ornithodoros, Carios, and Argas genera ticks also form three separate 
monophyletic lineages. The striking similarities between tick and nairovirus 
phylogenies are consistent with possible coevolution of the viruses and their 
tick hosts. Fossil and phylogenetic data placing the hard tick-soft tick 
divergence between 120 and 92 million years ago suggest an ancient origin for 
viruses of the genus Nairovirus.

"Rapid detection, characterization, and enumeration of foodborne pathogens","<jats:p>J. Hoorfar. Rapid detection, characterization, and enumeration of foodborne pathogens. APMIS 2011; 119 (Suppl. 133): 1–24.</jats:p><jats:p>As food safety management further develops, microbiological testing will continue to play an important role in assessing whether Food Safety Objectives are achieved. However, traditional microbiological culture‐based methods are limited, particularly in their ability to provide timely data. The present review discusses the reasons for the increasing interest in rapid methods, current developments in the field, the research needs, and the future trends. The advent of biotechnology has introduced new technologies that led to the emergence of rapid diagnostic methods and altered food testing practices. Rapid methods are comprised of many different detection technologies, including specialized enzyme substrates, antibodies and DNA, ranging from simple differential plating media to the use of sophisticated instruments. The use of non‐invasive sampling techniques for live animals especially came into focus with the 1990s outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy that was linked to the human outbreak of Creutzfeldt Jakob’s Disease. Serology is still an important tool in preventing foodborne pathogens to enter the human food supply through meat and milk from animals. One of the primary uses of rapid methods is for fast screening of large number of samples, where most of them are expected to be test‐negative, leading to faster product release for sale. This has been the main strength of rapid methods such as real‐time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Enrichment PCR, where a primary culture broth is tested in PCR, is the most common approach in rapid testing. Recent reports show that it is possible both to enrich a sample and enumerate by pathogen‐specific real‐time PCR, if the enrichment time is short. This can be especially useful in situations where food producers ask for the level of pathogen in a contaminated product. Another key issue is automation, where the key drivers are miniaturization and multiple testing, which mean that not only one instrument is flexible enough to test for many pathogens but also many pathogens can be detected with one test. The review is mainly based on the author’s scientific work that has contributed with the following new developments to this field: (i) serologic tests for large‐scale screening, surveillance, or eradication programs, (ii) same‐day detection of<jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>that otherwise was considered as difficult to achieve, (iii) pathogen enumeration following a short log‐phase enrichment, (iv) detection of foodborne pathogens in air samples, and finally (v) biotracing of pathogens based on mathematical modeling, even in the absence of isolate. Rapid methods are discussed in a broad global health perspective, international food supply, and for improvement of quantitative microbial risk assessments. The need for quantitative sample preparation techniques, culture‐independent, metagenomic‐based detection, online monitoring, a global validation infrastructure has been emphasized. The cost and ease of use of rapid assays remain challenging obstacles to surmount.</jats:p>",0
Biological and Biochemical Characterization of Sheep Scrapie in Japan,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Due to the apparent absence of an agent-specific nucleic acid genome, scrapie strains cannot be classified by genome characterization, which is commonly used for the classification of many viruses. However, scrapie strains can be distinguished to some extent by biological properties such as transmissibility to experimental animals and distribution of neuropathological lesions and by biochemical properties such as the molecular mass and relative protease-resistance of the disease-specific isoform of prion protein (PrP
            <jats:sup>Sc</jats:sup>
            ). In order to preliminarily characterize the scrapie strains that are prevalent in Japan, we analyzed the transmissibility of sheep scrapie isolates to mice and the relative proteinase K (PK) resistance of the corresponding PrP
            <jats:sup>Sc</jats:sup>
            . The results indicate that Japanese scrapie strains can be divided into at least three groups based on biological and biochemical properties. The first group includes isolates which cause disease in mice with an incubation period of ∼400 days and possess PrP
            <jats:sup>Sc</jats:sup>
            with relatively high PK resistance. Isolates of the second group contain PrP
            <jats:sup>Sc</jats:sup>
            that is highly resistant to PK digestion but transmit poorly to mice. The final group consists of isolates that cause disease in mice with an incubation period of less than 300 days and are associated with PrP
            <jats:sup>Sc</jats:sup>
            with reduced PK resistance. Sheep scrapie has occurred sporadically in Japan since1982, with only ∼60 officially reported cases so far. However, the diversity of scrapie strains in the field suggested by our data raises the concern that a scrapie strain similar to the parental agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy could exist or emerge in Japan. Thus, continuous surveillance for scrapie will be required to prevent the further spread of scrapie, not only among the sheep population but also to other species, and to eliminate any potential risk of sheep scrapie to public health.

Control of rabies requires a consistent supply of dependable resources, 
constructive cooperation between veterinary and public health authorities, and 
systematic surveillance. These are challenging in any circumstances, but 
particularly during conflict. Here we describe available human rabies 
surveillance data from Iraq, results of renewed sampling for rabies in animals, 
and the first genetic characterisation of circulating rabies strains from Iraq. 
Human rabies is notifiable, with reported cases increasing since 2003, and a 
marked increase in Baghdad between 2009 and 2010. These changes coincide with 
increasing numbers of reported dog bites. There is no laboratory confirmation of 
disease or virus characterisation and no systematic surveillance for rabies in 
animals. To address these issues, brain samples were collected from domestic 
animals in the greater Baghdad region and tested for rabies. Three of 40 brain 
samples were positive using the fluorescent antibody test and hemi-nested RT-PCR 
for rabies virus (RABV). Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using partial 
nucleoprotein gene sequences derived from the samples demonstrated the viruses 
belong to a single virus variant and share a common ancestor with viruses from 
neighbouring countries, 22 (95% HPD 14-32) years ago. These include countries 
lying to the west, north and east of Iraq, some of which also have other virus 
variants circulating concurrently. These results suggest possible multiple 
introductions of rabies into the Middle East, and regular trans-boundary 
movement of disease. Although 4000 years have passed since the original 
description of disease consistent with rabies, animals and humans are still 
dying of this preventable and neglected zoonosis.

Molecular and phylogenetic analyses of a new Amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV-1313),"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The amphotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLV-A's) are naturally occurring, exogenously acquired gammaretroviruses that are indigenous to the Southern California wild mice. These viruses replicate in a wide range of cell types including human cells <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> and they can cause both hematological and neurological disorders in feral as well as in the inbred laboratory mice. Since MuLV-A's also exhibit discrete interference and neutralization properties, the envelope proteins of these viruses have been extremely useful for studying virus-host cell interactions and as vehicles for transfer of foreign genes into a variety of hosts including human cells. However, the genomic structure of any of the several known MuLV-A's has not been established and the evolutionary relationship of amphotropic retroviruses to the numerous exogenous or endogenous MuLV strains remains elusive. Herein we present a complete genetic structure of a novel amphotropic virus designated MuLV-1313 and demonstrate that this retrovirus together with other MuLV-A's belongs to a distinct molecular, biological and phylogenetic class among the MuLV strains isolated from a large number of the laboratory inbred or feral mice.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The host range of MuLV-1313 is similar to the previously isolated MuLV-A's except that this virus replicates efficiently in mammalian as well as in chicken cells. Compared to ENV proteins of other MuLV-A's (4070A, 1504A and 10A-1), the gp70 protein of MuLV-1313 exhibits differences in its signal peptides and the proline-rich hinge regions. However, the MuLV-1313 envelope protein is totally unrelated to those present in a broad range of murine retroviruses that have been isolated from various inbred and feral mice globally. Genetic analysis of the entire MuLV-1313 genome by dot plot analyses, which compares each nucleotide of one genome with the corresponding nucleotide of another, revealed that the genome of this virus, with the exception of the <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> gene, is more closely related to the biologically distinct wild mouse ecotropic retrovirus (Cas-Br-E) isolated from another region of the Southern California, than to any of the 15 MuLV strains whose full-length sequences are present in the GenBank. This finding was corroborated by phylogenetic analyses and hierarchical clustering of the entire genomic sequence of MuLV-1313, which also placed all MULV-A's in a genetically distinct category among the large family of retroviruses isolated from numerous mouse strains globally. Likewise, construction of separate dendrograms for each of the Gag, Pol and Env proteins of MuLV-1313 demonstrated that the amphotropic retroviruses belong to a phylogenetically exclusive group of gammaretroviruses compared to all known MuLV strains.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The molecular, biological and phylogenetic properties of amphotropic retroviruses including MuLV-1313 are distinct compared to a large family of exogenously- or endogenously-transmitted ecotropic, polytropic and xenotropic MuLV strains of the laboratory and feral mice. Further, both the naturally occurring amphotropic and a biologically discrete ecotropic retrovirus of the Southern California wild mice are more closely related to each other on the evolutionary tree than any other mammalian gammaretrovirus indicating a common origin of these viruses. This is the first report of a complete genomic analysis of a unique group of phylogenetically distinct amphotropic virus.</jats:p>

Detection of diverse novel astroviruses from small mammals in China,"<jats:p>Astroviruses infect humans and many animal species and cause gastroenteritis. To extensively understand the distribution and genetic diversity of astrovirus in small mammals, we tested 968 anal swabs from 39 animal species, most of which were bats and rodents. We detected diverse astroviruses in 10 bat species, including known bat astroviruses and a large number of novel viruses. Meanwhile, novel groups of astroviruses were identified in three wild rodent species and a remarkably high genetic diversity of astrovirus was revealed in <jats:italic>Eothenomys cachinus</jats:italic>. We detected astroviruses in captive-bred porcupines and a nearly full-length genome sequence was determined for one strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete ORF2 sequence suggested that this strain may share a common ancestor with porcine astrovirus type 2. Moreover, to our knowledge, this study reports the first discovery of astroviruses in shrews and pikas. Our results provide new insights for understanding these small mammals as natural reservoirs of astroviruses.</jats:p>",0

In order to determine the actual prevalence of avian influenza virus (AIV) and 
Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in ducks in Shandong province of China, extensive 
surveillance studies were carried out in the breeding ducks of an intensive farm 
from July 2007 to September 2008. Each month cloacal and tracheal swabs were 
taken from 30 randomly selected birds that appeared healthy. All of the swabs 
were negative for influenza A virus recovery, whereas 87.5% of tracheal swabs 
and 100% cloacal swabs collected in September 2007, were positive for Newcastle 
disease virus isolation. Several NDV isolates were recovered from tracheal and 
cloacal swabs of apparently healthy ducks. All of the isolates were apathogenic 
as determined by the MDT and ICPI. The HN gene and the variable region of F gene 
(nt 47-420) of four isolates selected at random were sequenced. A 374 bp region 
of F gene and the full length of HN gene were used for phylogenetic analysis. 
Four isolates were identified as the same isolate based on nucleotide sequences 
identities of 99.2-100%, displaying a closer phylogenetic relationship to 
lentogenic Class I viruses. There were 1.9-9.9% nucleotide differences between 
the isolates and other Class I virus in the variable region of F gene (nt 
47-420), whereas there were 38.5-41.2% nucleotide difference between the 
isolates and Class II viruses. The amino acid sequences of the F protein 
cleavage sites in these isolates were 112-ERQERL-117. The full length of HN gene 
of these isolates was 1851 bp, coding 585 amino acids. The homology analysis of 
the nucleotide sequence of HN gene indicated that there were 2.0-4.2% nucleotide 
differences between the isolates and other Class I viruses, whereas there were 
29.5-40.9% differences between the isolates and Class II viruses. The results 
shows that these isolates are not phylogenetically related to the vaccine strain 
(LaSota). This study adds to the understanding of the ecology of influenza 
viruses and Newcastle disease viruses in ducks and emphasizes the need for 
constant surveillance in times of an ongoing and expanding epidemic of AIV and 
NDV.

Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causes an economically important and highly 
contagious disease of pigs worldwide. C-strain vaccination is one of the most 
effective ways to contain this disease. Since 2014, sporadic CSF outbreaks have 
been occurring in some C-strain vaccinated provinces of China. To decipher the 
disease etiology, 25 CSFV E2 genes from 169 clinical samples were cloned and 
sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all 25 isolates belonged to 
subgenotype 2.1. Twenty-three of the 25 isolates were clustered in a newly 
defined subgenotype, 2.1d, and shared some consistent molecular characteristics. 
To determine whether the complete E2 gene was under positive selection pressure, 
we used a site-by-site analysis to identify specific codons that underwent 
evolutionary selection, and seven positively selected codons were found. Three 
positively selected sites (amino acids 17, 34, and 72) were identified in 
antigenicity-relevant domains B/C of the amino-terminal half of the E2 protein. 
In addition, another positively selected site (amino acid 200) exhibited a 
polarity change from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, which may change the 
antigenicity and virulence of CSFV. The results indicate that the circulating 
CSFV strains in Shandong province were mostly clustered in subgenotype 2.1d. 
Moreover, the identification of these positively selected sites could help to 
reveal molecular determinants of virulence or pathogenesis, and to clarify the 
driving force of CSFV evolution in East China.

We obtained 5,990,261 high quality reads from intestine and lung tissue of 235 bats, including 2,975,371 assembled sequences. 631,490 reads predicted overlapping sequences for the open reading frame (ORF), which accounts for 2.37% of all the sequences (15,012/631,490). Further, the acquired virus sequences were classified into 25 viral families, including 16 vertebrate viruses, four plant viruses and five insect viruses. All bat samples were screened by specific PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Using these techniques, we discovered many novel bat viruses and some bat viruses closely-related to known human/animal pathogens, including coronavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, astrovirus, and circovirus. In summary, this study extended our understanding of bats as the viral reservoirs. Additionally, it also provides a basis for furher studying the transmission of viruses from bats to humans.</jats:p>",0
Computational Study of Interdependence Between Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase of Pandemic 2009 H1N1,"1. IEEE Trans Nanobioscience. 2015 Mar;14(2):157-66. doi:

Computational study of interdependence between hemagglutinin and neuraminidase 
of pandemic 2009 H1N1.

Hu W.

Influenza type A viruses are classified into subtypes based on their two surface 
proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA protein facilitates 
the viral binding and entering a host cell and the NA protein helps the release 
of viral progeny from the infected cell. The complementary roles of HA and NA 
entail their collaboration, which has important implications for viral 
replication and fitness. The HA protein from early strains of pandemic 2009 H1N1 
of swine origin preferentially binds to human type receptors with a weak binding 
to avian type receptors. This virus caused several human deaths in December 2013 
in Texas, USA, which motivated us to investigate the changes of genetic features 
that might contribute to the surged virulence of the virus. Our time series 
analysis on the strains of this virus collected from 2009 to 2013 implied that 
the HA binding preference of this virus in USA, Europe, and Asia has been the 
characteristic of swine H1N1 virus since 2009. However, its characteristic of 
seasonal human H1N1 and its binding avidity for avian type receptors both were 
on steady rise and had a clear increase in 2013 with American strains having the 
sharpest surge. The first change could enhance the viral transmission and 
replication in humans and the second could increase its ability to cause 
infection deep in lungs, which might account for the recent human deaths in 
Texas. In light of HA and NA coadaptation and evolutionary interactions, we also 
explored the NA activity of this virus to reveal the functional balance between 
HA and NA during the course of virus evolution. Finally we identified amino acid 
substitutions in HA and NA of the virus that were critical for the observed 
evolution.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the predominant 
pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Although these viruses 
exhibit genetic homology, the clinical manifestations caused by the two viruses 
have some discrepancies. In addition, the underlying mechanisms leading to these 
differences remain unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in numerous 
biological or pathological processes, including host responses to viral 
infections. Here, we focused on differences in miRNA expression patterns in 
rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with EV71 and 
CA16 at various time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results 
demonstrated that 106 known and 13 novel miRNAs exhibited significant 
differences, and 32 key miRNAs among them for target prediction presented 
opposite trends in the EV71- and CA16-infected samples. GO and pathway analysis 
of the predicted targets showed enrichment in 14 biological processes, 10 
molecular functions, 8 cellular components and 104 pathways. Subsequently, 
regulatory networks of miRNA-transcription factors, miRNA-predicted targets, 
miRNA-GOs and miRNA-pathways were constructed to reveal the complex regulatory 
mechanisms of miRNAs during the infection phase. Ultimately, we analysed 
hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets involved in immune system 
processes, which indicated that the innate and adaptive immunity following EV71 
and CA16 infections may be remarkably distinct. In conclusion, this report is 
the first describing miRNA expression profiles in PBMCs with EV71 and CA16 
infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our findings could provide a 
valuable basis for further studies on the regulatory roles of miRNAs related to 
the different immune responses caused by EV71 and CA16 infections.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) mainly caused by Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and 
coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) infections which presented significantly different 
clinical manifestations. Nevertheless, the factors underlying these differences 
remain unclear. Recently, the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host 
interactions have been highlighted. Here, we performed comprehensive miRNA 
profiling in EV71- and CA16-infected human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells at 
multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 
154 known and 47 novel miRNAs exhibited remarkable differences in expression. Of 
these, 65 miRNAs, including 58 known and 7 novel miRNAs, presented opposite 
trends in EV71- and CA16-infected samples. Subsequently, we mainly focused on 
the 56 known differentially expressed miRNAs by further screening for targets 
prediction. GO and pathway analysis of these targets demonstrated that 18 
biological processes, 7 molecular functions, 1 cellular component and 123 
pathways were enriched. Among these pathways, Cadherin signalling pathway, Wnt 
signalling pathway and angiogenesis showed significant alterations. The 
regulatory networks of these miRNAs with predicted targets, GOs, pathways and 
transcription factors were determined, which suggested that miRNAs displayed 
intricate regulatory mechanisms during the infection phase. Consequently, we 
specifically analysed the hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets 
involved in adhesion. The results indicated that the distinct changes induced by 
EV71 and CA16 infection may be partly linked to airway epithelial barrier 
function. Taken together, our data provide useful insights that help elucidate 
the different host-pathogen interactions following EV71 and CA16 infection and 
might offer novel therapeutic targets for these infections.

The pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a porcine virus classified as a member of the 
Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of Herpesviridae. Recent studies have confirmed 
that viruses regulate the gene expression in host cells. Commonly affected genes 
include oxidative-stress response genes, genes involved in the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway, and 
interferon- and interleukin-related genes. However, the post-transcriptional 
regulation of host genes following PRV infection is hitherto unclear. In this 
study, we used miRNA microarray approaches to assess miRNA expression in 
PRV-infected porcine kidney 15 cell line (PK-15), and observed that miR-21 was 
expressed at high level 12h after the cells were infected with PRV. Furthermore, 
we identified chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), also named 
interferon-γ inducible protein-10 (IP-10), as a novel target gene of miR-21. 
IP-10 was down-regulated at 4h after PRV infection. PRV replication was 
significantly inhibited by IP-10 overexpression.

"Detection of a novel porcine parvovirus, PPV4, in chinese swine herds","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:p>To determine whether the novel porcine parvovirus type 4 (PPV4) recently reported in America is prevalent in China, a set of specific primers was designed and used for molecular survey of PPV4 among the clinical samples collected from various provinces of China between 2006 and 2010. The results showed that PPV4 is present in Chinese swine herds at a rate of 2.09% (12/573) among the clinical samples examined and 0.76% (1/132) among the samples taken from healthy animals. We also noted that PPV4 was not detected in samples taken prior to 2009. Analysis of the coding sequences showed that the Chinese and American PPV4 genome sequences are closely related with greater than 99% nucleotide sequence identity. Similar to a previous study, viral genomes in head-to-tail configuration of various lengths of the non-coding region were detected. Our findings confirmed that PPV4 is a unique recently discovered virus in pigs. Phylogenetically, PPV4 is most closely related to bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2, which is not a <jats:italic>Bocavirus</jats:italic> and is not assigned to any <jats:italic>Parvovirinae</jats:italic> genus) and shares limited ORF1 (33.6%) and ORF2 (24.5%) amino acid identity. With respect to genome structure and organization, PPV4 encodes an ORF3 in the middle of the viral genome that resembles the <jats:italic>Bocavirus</jats:italic> genus. However, the PPV4 ORF3 encoded protein shares minimal amino acid identity with the ORF3 encoded proteins of the <jats:italic>Bocavirus</jats:italic> genus.</jats:p>",0

Porcine epidemic diarrhea, a disastrous gastrointestinal disease, causes great 
financial losses due to its high infectivity, morbidity and mortality in 
suckling piglets despite the development and application of various vaccines. In 
this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to explore differences in the 
intestinal microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with 
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The results revealed that the small 
intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets infected with PEDV showed low 
diversity and was dominated by Proteobacteria (49.1%). Additionally, the 
composition of the small intestinal microbiota of sucking piglets infected with 
PEDV showed marked differences from that of the uninfected piglets. Some of the 
taxa showing differences in abundance between uninfected piglets and piglets 
infected with PEDV were associated with cellular transport and catabolism, 
energy metabolism, the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and amino 
acid metabolism as determined through the prediction of microbial function based 
on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Therefore, adjusting the intestinal microbiota 
might be a promising method for the prevention or treatment of PEDV.

A Selective Bottleneck Shapes the Evolutionary Mutant Spectra of Enterovirus A71 during Viral Dissemination in Humans,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>RNA viruses accumulate mutations to rapidly adapt to environmental changes. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes various clinical manifestations with occasional severe neurological complications. However, the mechanism by which EV-A71 evolves within the human body is unclear. Utilizing deep sequencing and haplotype analyses of viruses from various tissues of an autopsy patient, we sought to define the evolutionary pathway by which enterovirus A71 evolves fitness for invading the central nervous system in humans. Broad mutant spectra with divergent mutations were observed at the initial infection sites in the respiratory and digestive systems. After viral invasion, we identified a haplotype switch and dominant haplotype, with glycine at VP1 residue 31 (VP1-31G) in viral particles disseminated into the integumentary and central nervous systems.<jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic>viral growth and fitness analyses indicated that VP1-31G conferred growth and a fitness advantage in human neuronal cells, whereas VP1-31D conferred enhanced replication in human colorectal cells. A higher proportion of VP1-31G was also found among fatal cases, suggesting that it may facilitate central nervous system infection in humans. Our data provide the first glimpse of EV-A71 quasispecies from oral tissues to the central nervous system within humans, showing broad implications for the surveillance and pathogenesis of this reemerging viral pathogen.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>EV-A71 continues to be a worldwide burden to public health. Although EV-A71 is the major etiological agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease, it can also cause neurological pulmonary edema, encephalitis, and even death, especially in children. Understanding selection processes enabling dissemination and accurately estimating EV-A71 diversity during invasion in humans are critical for applications in viral pathogenesis and vaccine studies. Here, we define a selection bottleneck appearing in respiratory and digestive tissues. Glycine substitution at VP1 residue 31 helps viruses break through the bottleneck and invade the central nervous system. This substitution is also advantageous for replication in neuronal cells<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. Considering that fatal cases contain enhanced glycine substitution at VP1-31, we suggest that the increased prevalence of VP1-31G may alter viral tropism and aid central nervous system invasion. Our findings provide new insights into a dynamic mutant spectral switch active during acute viral infection with emerging viral pathogens.</jats:p>",0

Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) infects cattle and, occupationally, 
humans. Prevalent subclinical infections, frequent reinfections, and virus 
persistence in healthy animals compound a poorly understood, but likely complex, 
scenario of BPSV perpetuation and transmission in nature. Here, we report the 
isolation of multiple BPSV strains coinfecting a single animal. Whole-genome 
analysis of isolated BPSV strains revealed genomic variability likely affecting 
virus virulence and infectivity. Further, incongruent phylogenetic relationships 
between viruses suggested genomic recombination. These results have significant 
implications for parapoxvirus infection biology and virus evolution in nature.

"A 4-year study of avian influenza virus prevalence and subtype diversity in ducks of Newfoundland, Canada","<jats:p>The island of Newfoundland, Canada, is at the eastern edge of North America and has migratory bird connections with the continental mainland as well as across the North Atlantic Ocean. Here, we report a 4-year avian influenza virus (AIV) epidemiological study in ducks in the St. John’s region of Newfoundland. The overall prevalence of AIV detection in ducks during this study was 7.2%, with American Black Ducks contributing the vast majority of the collected samples and the AIV positives. The juvenile ducks showed a significantly higher AIV detection rate (10.6%) compared with adults (3.4%). Seasonally, AIV prevalence rates were higher in the autumn (8.4%), but positives were still detected in the winter (4.6%). Preliminary serology tests showed a high incidence of previous AIV infection (20/38, 52.6%). A total of 43 viruses were characterized for their HA–NA or HA subtypes, which revealed a large diversity of AIV subtypes and little recurrence of subtypes from year to year. Investigation of the movement patterns of ducks in this region showed that it is a largely non-migratory duck population, which may contribute to the observed pattern of high AIV subtype turnover. Phylogenetic analysis of 4 H1N1 and one H5N4 AIVs showed these viruses were highly similar to other low pathogenic AIV sequences from waterfowl in North America and assigned all gene segments into American-avian clades. Notably, the H1N1 viruses, which were identified in consecutive years, possessed homologous genomes. Such detection of homologous AIV genomes across years is rare, but indicates the role of the environmental reservoir in viral perpetuation.</jats:p>",0

Thirty-one Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) isolated from domestic and wild 
birds in Shandong Province, China (2006-2014) were characterized genetically, 
pathogenically and antigenically. Phylogenetic analysis classified the viruses 
into a single genotype under Class I, and four genotypes under Class II. The 
nineteen viruses classified in genotype VII of Class II were velogenic, while 
the other viruses were either mesogenic or lentogenic to chickens. Some NDV 
isolates (17/23) showed no neutralizing reactivity with a monoclonal antibody 
developed against the HN protein of the LaSota strain, reflecting the mutation 
at the related antigenic epitope. When challenged with two genotype VII NDV 
isolates, LaSota-vaccinated SPF chickens were prevented from disease 
development, but virus shedding was detected for at least 5 days post challenge. 
Circulation of the same NDV isolate for up to 13 years suggested the role of an 
environmental reservoir in NDV perpetuation, and reinforced the importance of 
strict biosecurity measures in addition to vaccination for disease control.

Porcine Torque teno virus (PTTV) was recently shown to partially contribute to 
the experimental induction of porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome and 
postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in pigs in the United States. We 
report here the identification of four distinct full-length genomic sequences of 
PTTV strains from a single pig in Virginia. Detailed analyses of the genomic 
organization, the degree of variability and the characteristics of conserved 
nucleotide and amino acid motifs of PTTV were conducted. The results showed that 
these four prototype U.S. strains of PTTV identified from the same pig represent 
distinct genotypes or subtypes and a revised classification system for PPTV is 
subsequently proposed. This is the first study documenting multiple PTTV 
infections with distinct genotypes or subtypes in a single pig. The 
identification of novel PTTV strains from pigs in the United States also pave 
the way for future disease characterization and genotyping of PTTV.

The Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase Protein of Newcastle Disease Virus Determines Tropism and Virulence,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) plays a crucial role in the process of infection. However, the exact contribution of the HN gene to NDV pathogenesis is not known. In this study, the role of the HN gene in NDV virulence was examined. By use of reverse genetics procedures, the HN genes of a virulent recombinant NDV strain, rBeaudette C (rBC), and an avirulent recombinant NDV strain, rLaSota, were exchanged. The hemadsorption and neuraminidase activities of the chimeric viruses showed significant differences from those of their parental strains, but heterotypic F and HN pairs were equally effective in fusion promotion. The tissue tropism of the viruses was shown to be dependent on the origin of the HN protein. The chimeric virus with the HN protein derived from the virulent virus exhibited a tissue predilection similar to that of the virulent virus, and vice versa. The chimeric viruses with reciprocal HN proteins either gained or lost virulence, as determined by a standard intracerebral pathogenicity index test of chickens and by the mean death time in chicken embryos (a measure devised to classify these viruses), indicating that virulence is a function of the amino acid differences in the HN protein. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the virulence of NDV is multigenic and that the cleavability of F protein alone does not determine the virulence of a strain.</jats:p>",0

We have cultured Cowpox virus (CPXV) from skin lesion material of a human 
patient from Austria. Phylogenetic comparison of the HA-gene revealed a rather 
homogeneous cluster with other local isolates from recent years, the A36R-gene 
was mostly related to elephant derived strains from Germany. Despite causing 
disease in human, the isolate AT/Carinthia/788/07 surprisingly even at high 
titers showed a highly reduced virulence in BALB/c mice upon intranasal 
inoculation as compared to vaccinia virus. This contrasts earlier reports on 
other CPXV isolates. Using shotgun DNA sequencing several insertions and 
deletions were found in genes presumably involved in host range, immune 
regulation as well as established virulence factors. These preliminary data 
could be an indication that CPXV strains with proven pathogenicity for humans 
may have reduced virulence in mice and vice versa. Additionally strains with a 
reduced virulence may have an advantage in persisting in less dense rodent 
populations.

Oral Fluids as a Live-Animal Sample Source for Evaluating Cross-Reactivity and Cross-Protection following Intranasal Influenza A Virus Vaccination in Pigs,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>In North American swine, there are numerous antigenically distinct H1 influenza A virus (IAV) variants currently circulating, making vaccine development difficult due to the inability to formulate a vaccine that provides broad cross-protection. Experimentally, live-attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines demonstrate increased cross-protection compared to inactivated vaccines. However, there is no standardized assay to predict cross-protection following LAIV vaccination. Hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody in serum is the gold standard correlate of protection following IAV vaccination. LAIV vaccination does not induce a robust serum HI antibody titer; however, a local mucosal antibody response is elicited. Thus, a live-animal sample source that could be used to evaluate LAIV immunogenicity and cross-protection is needed. Here, we evaluated the use of oral fluids (OF) and nasal wash (NW) collected after IAV inoculation as a live-animal sample source in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to predict cross-protection in comparison to traditional serology. Both live-virus exposure and LAIV vaccination provided heterologous protection, though protection was greatest against more closely phylogenetically related viruses. IAV-specific IgA was detected in NW and OF samples and was cross-reactive to representative IAV from each H1 cluster. Endpoint titers of cross-reactive IgA in OF from pigs exposed to live virus was associated with heterologous protection. While LAIV vaccination provided significant protection, LAIV immunogenicity was reduced compared to live-virus exposure. These data suggest that OF from pigs inoculated with wild-type IAV, with surface genes that match the LAIV seed strain, could be used in an ELISA to assess cross-protection and the antigenic relatedness of circulating and emerging IAV in swine.</jats:p>",0

The rumen is a complex ecosystem composed of anaerobic bacteria, protozoa, 
fungi, methanogenic archaea and phages. These microbes interact closely to 
breakdown plant material that cannot be digested by humans, whilst providing 
metabolic energy to the host and, in the case of archaea, producing methane. 
Consequently, ruminants produce meat and milk, which are rich in high-quality 
protein, vitamins and minerals, and therefore contribute to food security. As 
the world population is predicted to reach approximately 9.7 billion by 2050, an 
increase in ruminant production to satisfy global protein demand is necessary, 
despite limited land availability, and whilst ensuring environmental impact is 
minimized. Although challenging, these goals can be met, but depend on our 
understanding of the rumen microbiome. Attempts to manipulate the rumen 
microbiome to benefit global agricultural challenges have been ongoing for 
decades with limited success, mostly due to the lack of a detailed understanding 
of this microbiome and our limited ability to culture most of these microbes 
outside the rumen. The potential to manipulate the rumen microbiome and meet 
global livestock challenges through animal breeding and introduction of dietary 
interventions during early life have recently emerged as promising new 
technologies. Our inability to phenotype ruminants in a high-throughput manner 
has also hampered progress, although the recent increase in ""omic"" data may 
allow further development of mathematical models and rumen microbial gene 
biomarkers as proxies. Advances in computational tools, high-throughput 
sequencing technologies and cultivation-independent ""omics"" approaches continue 
to revolutionize our understanding of the rumen microbiome. This will ultimately 
provide the knowledge framework needed to solve current and future ruminant 
livestock challenges.

We used a Bayesian classification approach to predict the bovine 
viral-diarrhoea-virus infection status of a herd when the prevalence of 
persistently infected animals in such herds is very small (e.g. <1%). An example 
of the approach is presented using data on beef herds in Wyoming, USA. The 
approach uses past covariate information (serum-neutralization titres collected 
on animals in 16 herds) within a predictive model for classification of a future 
observable herd. Simulations to estimate misclassification probabilities for 
different misclassification costs and prevalences of infected herds can be used 
as a guide to the sample size needed for classification of a future herd.

Ballast water is a common vector for the transport of invasive species to new 
marine and aquatic environments. We used a metagenomics approach to examine the 
composition and diversity of viral communities in ballast water from ships 
originating in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, New York, and Panama, and in water from the 
port of their destination in Busan, Korea. Myoviridae was the most abundant 
virus family in ballast water, followed Podoviridae and Siphoviridae. We also 
identified viruses that infect invertebrates, amoebas, and algae in ballast 
water and in the Busan port water. Interestingly, there were several viruses 
that infect humans or other animals (Swinepox virus, Raccoonpox virus, Suid 
herpesvirus, and Human endogenous retrovirus) in the samples from New York and 
Panama. In addition, there were giant viruses in all the ballast water samples, 
especially, identified Megavirus chilensis in New York and Panama, and 
Pandoravirus salinus in Mexico and Saudi Arabia. These results provide detailed 
descriptions of the characteristics of the viruses present in ballast water, 
document significant viral diversity, and indicate the potential translocation 
of viruses via ballast water.

Herd immunity and fatal cases of influenza among the population exposed to poultry and wild birds in Russian Asia in 2013–2014,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>In total 1,525 blood serum samples were collected in October, 2013 in Russian Asia from people who reside in territories that are at high risk for emergence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Presence of antibodies to influenza viruses in the sera was tested in hemagglutination inhibition test. None of the samples produced positive results with the antigens A/H5 and A/H7. Twelve strains of influenza A(H1N1pdm09) virus were isolated from people who died presumably from influenza during 2013–2014 epidemic season. All strains were similar to vaccine strain A/California/07/09 according to their antigenic properties and sensitivity to anti‐neuraminidase drugs (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Genetic analysis revealed that all strains belong to group 6, subgroup 6B of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Substitutions in HA1: S164F add E235K as well as E47G, A86V, K331R, N386K, N397K in NA, and K131E, N29S in NS1, and N29S, R34Q in NEP separate investigated strains into two groups: 1st group—A/Chita/1114/2014, A/Chita/1115/2014, A/Chita/853/2014, A/Barnaul/269/2014 and 2nd group—A/Chita/655/2014, A/Chita/656/2014, A/Chita/709/2014, A/Chita/873/2014. Mutation D222G in HA1, which is often associated with high morbidity of the illness, was present in strain A/Novosibirsk/114/2014. Substitution N386K in NA removes a potential N‐glycosylation site in neuraminidases of A/Chita/1114/2014, A/Chita/1115/2014, A/Chita/853/2014, A/Barnaul/269/2014, A/Novosibirsk/114/2014, and A/Blagoveshensk/252/2014. <jats:bold><jats:italic>J.

Molecular Identification of Enteroviruses from Cattle and Goat Feces and Environment in Thailand,"<jats:p>Possible new EV-E and EV-G genotypes were identified for EVs detected in this study. The EV-E viruses were also successfully isolated from MDBK cells. The goat EV sequence analysis suggested the presence of an ovine/caprine-specific EV group that is different from EV-G of porcine origin. The significance of our research is that it identifies and characterizes possible novel EVs, thereby indicating that enteroviruses in animals are continually evolving. The facts that enteroviruses can persist in the environment, contaminate it for long periods, and be transmitted between animals raise serious concerns regarding this group of viruses as emerging livestock pathogens.</jats:p>",0
Variations in the major envelope glycoprotein GP5 of Czech strains of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus,"<jats:p>The major envelope glycoprotein genes (ORF5) of seven Czech isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were amplified and their nucleotide sequences were determined. ORF5 displayed nucleotide and amino acid identities of 87·5–100% and 87·6–100%, respectively, among the isolates. In a phylogenetic tree, all European isolates were grouped in a genotype distinct from that of reference American strains (VR-2332, IAF-Klop). Among the European isolates, two different clades were identified. Two Czech isolates (V-501 and V-503) and Italian strain PRRSV 2156 fell into one clade. The remaining European strains comprised the second clade. Surprisingly, two separately clustered strains (V-501 and V-516) were isolated from the same herd. Additionally, the possible effect of <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> cultivation on the nucleotide sequence was analysed. Nine point mutations in the ORF5 region resulted from 152 <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> passages of the V-502 isolate in MARC-145 cells.</jats:p>",0

"Genetic heterogeneity among parapoxviruses isolated from sheep, cattle and Japanese serows (Capricornis crispus)","<jats:p>Standard strains of four parapoxviruses and seven unclassified Japanese strains isolated from sheep, cattle and wild Japanese serows (<jats:italic>Capricornis crispus</jats:italic>) were compared molecularly. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of viral DNA, indirect immunofluorescence assays using monoclonal antibodies, partial nucleotide sequencing of the envelope gene, phylogenetic analysis and PCR–RFLP were carried out. These analyses revealed that the parapoxviruses were divided into four groups and the region sequenced in this study was highly conserved within each group. Each of the Japanese isolates was classified into one of these groups. These findings also indicated that parapoxvirus infections among wild Japanese serows seem to be caused by at least two different parapoxviruses, bovine papular stomatitis virus and orf virus. The methods presented here are useful for genetic characterization and classification of parapoxviruses.</jats:p>",0
The intestinal microbiome of the pig,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The intestinal microbiome has been the subject of study for many decades because of its importance in the health and well being of animals. The bacterial components of the intestinal microbiome have closely evolved as animals have and in so doing contribute to the overall development and metabolic needs of the animal. The microbiome of the pig has been the subject of many investigations using culture-dependent methods and more recently using culture-independent techniques. A review of the literature is consistent with many of the ecologic principles put forth by Rene Dubos. Animals develop an intestinal microbiome over time and space. During the growth and development of the pig, the microbiome changes in composition in a process known as the microbial succession. There are clear and distinct differences in the composition of the pig intestinal microbiome moving from the proximal end of the intestinal tract to the distal end. The majority (&gt;90%) of the bacteria in the pig intestinal microbiome are from two Phyla: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. However, the ileum has a high percentage of bacteria in the phylum Proteobacterium (up to 40%). Perturbations to the microbiome occur in response to many factors including stresses, treatment with antibiotics, and diet.</jats:p>",0

In recent years, no reports regarding genetic information on porcine 
reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) with a focus on Japan have 
been published. To clarify the effect of time on PRRSV genomic evolution, we 
sequenced the open reading frame 5 (600 or 603 bases) obtained from Japanese 
PRRSV isolates for three periods (1992-1993, 2000-2001, and 2007-2008) and 
compared their phylogenetic relationships. Assessment of mean pairwise homology 
of nucleotide sequences of PRRSV isolates indicated a trend towards increasing 
heterogeneity over time. In addition, we newly detected a virus classified in 
cluster IV, indicative of the increasing genetic variation of PRRSV in Japan.

Porcine astroviruses (PoAstVs) are ubiquitous enteric virus of pigs that are 
distributed in several countries throughout the world. Since PoAstVs are 
detected in apparent healthy pigs, the clinical significance of infection is 
unknown. However, AstVs have recently been associated with a severe neurological 
disorder in animals, including humans, and zoonotic potential has been 
suggested. To date, little is known about the epidemiology of PoAstVs among the 
pig population in Japan. In this report, we present an analysis of nearly 
complete genomes of 36 PoAstVs detected by a metagenomics approach in the feces 
of Japanese pigs. Based on a phylogenetic analysis and pairwise sequence 
comparison, 10, 5, 15, and 6 sequences were classified as PoAstV2, PoAstV3, 
PoAstV4, and PoAstV5, respectively. Co-infection with two or three strains was 
found in individual fecal samples from eight pigs. The phylogenetic trees of 
ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 of PoAstV2 and PoAstV4 showed differences in their 
topologies. The PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains shared high sequence identities 
within each genotype in all ORFs; however, one PoAstV3 strain and one PoAstV5 
strain showed considerable sequence divergence from the other PoAstV3 and 
PoAstV5 strains, respectively, in ORF2. Recombination analysis using whole 
genomes revealed evidence of multiple possible intra-genotype recombination 
events in PoAstV2 and PoAstV4, suggesting that recombination might have 
contributed to the genetic diversity and played an important role in the 
evolution of Japanese PoAstVs.

A potyvirus (isolate IB) causing dappled or faded fruits and foliar mosaic 
symptoms of purple passionfruit, was found in the botanical garden of Kagoshima 
University, Japan. This isolate--differed in host range from isolates of Passion 
fruit woodiness virus (PWV)-AO, previously reported to cause ""woodiness"" in 
Japan. Isolates IB and AO had 83% amino acid identity in their coat proteins 
(CPs). In phylogenetic analysis, East Asian isolates IB, AO, and PWV-Taiwan 
clustered together, and were distinguishable from Australian PWV and Brazilian 
Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus isolates, which also cause ""woodiness"" in 
passionfruit. We propose the name ""East Asian Passiflora virus (EAPV)"" for the 
new potyvirus species.

            <jats:p>With the remarkable increase of microbial and viral sequence data obtained from high-throughput DNA sequencers, novel tools are needed for comprehensive analysis of the big sequence data. We have developed “Batch-Learning Self-Organizing Map (BLSOM)” which can characterize very many, even millions of, genomic sequences on one plane. Influenza virus is one of zoonotic viruses and shows clear host tropism. Important issues for bioinformatics studies of influenza viruses are prediction of genomic sequence changes in the near future and surveillance of potentially hazardous strains.</jats:p>

            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            <jats:p>To characterize sequence changes in influenza virus genomes after invasion into humans from other animal hosts, we applied BLSOMs to analyses of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide compositions in all genome sequences of influenza A and B viruses and found clear host-dependent clustering (self-organization) of the sequences.</jats:p>

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Viruses isolated from humans and birds differed in mononucleotide composition from each other. In addition, host-dependent oligonucleotide compositions that could not be explained with the host-dependent mononucleotide composition were revealed by oligonucleotide BLSOMs. Retrospective time-dependent directional changes of mono- and oligonucleotide compositions, which were visualized for human strains on BLSOMs, could provide predictive information about sequence changes in newly invaded viruses from other animal hosts (e.g. the swine-derived pandemic H1N1/09).</jats:p>

            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Basing on the host-dependent oligonucleotide composition, we proposed a strategy for prediction of directional changes of virus sequences and for surveillance of potentially hazardous strains when introduced into human populations from non-human sources. Millions of genomic sequences from infectious microbes and viruses have become available because of their medical and social importance, and BLSOM can characterize the big data and support efficient knowledge discovery.</jats:p>

Molecular Characteristics of Infectious Bursal Disease Viruses from Asymptomatic Broiler Flocks in Europe,"1. Avian Dis. 2006 Dec;50(4):532-6. doi: 10.1637/7528-032006R1.1.

Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) exists in several different antigenic and 
pathogenic forms. The immune suppression caused by this virus in young chickens 
is not always associated with clinical signs of disease. The antigenic variant 
viruses originally described in the United States typically do not cause 
clinical signs of disease but can cause a marked immune suppression via the 
destruction of B lymphocytes. Using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) assay we conducted a survey of asymptomatic broiler chicken 
flocks in Europe for IBDV. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the 
viral protein 2 (VP2) gene of four isolates from Spain and four isolates from 
France indicated they may be different from the classic and very virulent (vv) 
IBDV strains found throughout Europe. Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic 
analysis of the hypervariable region of the VP2 gene indicated that all eight 
viruses were more similar to U.S. variant viruses than classic viruses. In two 
viruses, one from France and one from Spain, threonine was observed at amino 
acid position 222 and serine was found at position 254. These two substitution 
mutations are characteristic of Delaware variant viruses. In addition, all eight 
viruses had mutated amino acid position 318 from glycine to aspartic acid, 
another substitution mutation commonly found in U.S. variant viruses. Although 
importation restrictions prevented us from directly testing the antigenicity of 
these viruses, their nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences suggest they 
could be antigenically distinctive compared to classic and vvIBDV commonly found 
in Europe. Confirmation of the presence of antigenic variant IBDV strains in 
Europe requires additional immunologic studies to elucidate the exact nature of 
the viral epitopes. Our data support the need for these immunologic studies.

Several phylogenetic lineages of the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) 
genome segment B have been identified. Although this genome segment has been 
shown to contribute to virulence, little is known about the genetic lineages 
that exist in the United States. The nucleotide genome segment B sequences of 67 
IBDV strains collected from 2002 to 2011 in the United States were examined. 
Although they were from nine different states, a majority (47) of these viruses 
were from California. A 722-base pair region near the 5' end of genome segment 
B, starting at nucleotide 168 and ending at 889, was examined and compared to 
sequences available in GenBank. The nucleotide sequence alignment revealed that 
mutations were frequently observed and that they were uniformly spaced 
throughout the region. When the predicted amino acids were aligned, amino acids 
at positions 145, 146, and 147 were found to change frequently. Six different 
amino acid triplets were observed and the very virulent (vv) IBDV strains (based 
on presence of vvIBDV genome segment A sequence) all had the triplet T145, D146, 
and N147. None of the non-vvIBDV strains had this TDN triplet. Phylogenetic 
analysis of the 67 nucleotide sequences revealed four significant genome segment 
B lineages among the U.S. viruses. One of these included the genome segment B 
typically found in vvIBDV and three contained non-vvIBDV genome segment B 
sequences. When the available sequences in GenBank were added to the analysis, 
two additional lineages were observed that did not contain U.S. viruses; one 
included viruses from China and the other contained viruses from the Ivory 
Coast. Although the samples tested do not represent all poultry producing 
regions in the United States, serotype 1 viruses from states outside California 
all belonged to one genome segment B lineage. The other three lineages observed 
in the United States were populated with viruses exclusively found in 
California, except the serotype 2 lineage, where the type strain was a serotype 
2 virus from Ohio. The data provide further evidence for the importance of 
genome segment B identification during routine molecular diagnosis of all IBDV 
strains.

To determine the genetic and epidemiological relationship of infectious 
bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates from commercial poultry to attenuated live IBV 
vaccines we conducted a phylogenetic network analysis on the full-length S1 
sequence for Arkansas (Ark), Massachusetts (Mass) and Delmarva/1639 (DMV/1639) 
type viruses isolated in 2015 from clinical cases by 3 different diagnostic 
laboratories. Phylogenetic network analysis of Ark isolates showed two 
predominant groups linked by 2 mutations, consistent with subpopulations found 
in commercial vaccines for this IBV type. In addition, a number of satellite 
groups surrounding the two predominant populations were observed for the Ark 
type virus, which is likely due to mutations associated with the nature of this 
vaccine to persist in flocks. The phylogenetic network analysis of Mass-type 
viruses shows two groupings corresponding to different manufacturers vaccine 
sequences. No satellite groups were observed for Mass-type viruses, which is 
consistent with no persistence of this vaccine type in the field. At the time of 
collection, no vaccine was being used for the DMV/1639 type viruses and 
phylogenetic network analysis showed a dispersed network suggesting no clear 
change in genetic distribution. Selection pressure analysis showed that the 
DMV/1639 and Mass-type strains were evolving under negative selection, whereas 
the Ark type viruses had evolved under positive selection. This data supports 
the hypothesis that live attenuated vaccine usage does play a role in the 
genetic profile of similar IB viruses in the field and phylogenetic network 
analysis can be used to identify vaccine and vaccine origin isolates, which is 
important for our understanding of the role live vaccines play in the 
evolutionary trajectory of those viruses.

The first known cases of human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza 
(HPAI) H5N1 viruses in Vietnam occurred in late 2003. However, HPAI H5N1 and 
low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 and H9N3 viruses were isolated from 
domestic waterfowl during live-bird market (LBM) surveillance in Vietnam in 2001 
and 2003. To understand the possible role of these early viruses in the genesis 
of H5N1 strains infecting people, we performed sequencing and molecular 
characterization. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin (HA) 
genes of two geese HPAI H5N1 strains belonged to clade 3, and their surface 
glycoprotein and replication complex genes were most closely related (98.5-99.7% 
homologous) to A/duck/Guangxi/22/01 (H5N1) virus, detected contemporarily in 
southern China, whilst the M and NS genes were derived from an A/duck/Hong 
Kong/2986.1/00 (H5N1)-like virus. The H5 HA gene of the duck HPAI H5N1 strain 
belonged to clade 5 and acquired a gene constellation from 
A/quail/Shantou/3846/02 (H5N1), A/teal/China/2978.1/02 (H5N1) and 
A/partridge/Shantou/2286/03 (H5N1)-like viruses. The phylogenetic analysis 
further indicated that all eight gene segments of goose and duck HPAI H5N1 and 
LPAI H5N2 viruses were distinct from those of H5N1 clade-1 viruses known to have 
caused fatal human infections in Vietnam since late 2003. The duck H9N3 isolates 
derived genes from aquatic-bird influenza viruses, and their H9 HA belonged to 
the Korean lineage. The PB2 gene of A/duck/Vietnam/340/01 (H9N3) virus had 
lysine at position 627. Based on the molecular characterization of specific 
amino acid residues in the surface and relevant internal protein-coding genes, 
the Vietnamese H5N1 and H9N3 virus isolates indicated specificity to avian cell 
surface receptor and susceptibility for currently licensed anti-influenza A 
virus chemotherapeutics. Our findings suggest that the H5N1 and H5N2 viruses 
that circulated among geese and ducks in LBMs in Hanoi, Vietnam, during 2001 and 
2003 were not the immediate ancestors of the clade-1 viruses associated with 
fatal human infections in Vietnam. The clade-1 HPAI H5N1 viruses were 
independently introduced into Vietnam.

Genetic Analysis of Avian Influenza Viruses: Cocirculation of Avian Influenza Viruses with Allele A and B Nonstructural Gene in Northern Pintail (<i>Anas acuta</i>) Ducks Wintering in Japan,"<jats:p>The pandemic influenza virus strains of 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2), and 2009 (H1N1) have genes related to avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The nonstructural (NS) gene of AIVs plays a significant role in host-viral interaction. However, little is known about the degree of diversity of this gene in Northern pintail (<jats:italic>Anas acuta</jats:italic>) ducks wintering in Japan. This study describes characteristics of pintail-originated H1N1, H1N2, H1N3, H5N2, H5N3, H5N9, and H7N7 viruses. Most of the viruses were revealed to be  avian strains and not related to pandemic and seasonal flu strains. Nevertheless, the NP genes of 62.5% (5/8) viruses were found closely related to a A/swine/Korea/C12/08, indicating exchange of genetic material and ongoing mammalian-linked evolution of AIVs. Besides, all the viruses, except Aomori/422/07 H1N1, contain PSIQSR*GLF motif usually found in avian, porcine, and human H1 strains. The Aomori/422/07 H1N1 has a PSVQSR*GLF motif identical to a North American strain. This findings linked to an important intercontinental, Asian-American biogeographical interface. Phylogenetically all the viruses were clustered in Eurasian lineage. Cocirculation of allele A and B (NS gene) viruses was evident in the study implying the existence of a wide reservoir of influenza A viruses in pintail wintering in Japan.</jats:p>",0

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes a highly contagious disease which 
continuously haunts the global poultry industry. The nature and molecular 
epidemiology of NDVs prevalent in recent outbreaks in India is poorly 
understood. This study aimed to characterize NDVs prevalent in vaccinated flocks 
in India using whole-genome sequencing and biological pathotyping. Twelve field 
isolates were collected from outbreaks which occurred in different parts of 
India and characterized as velogenic based on their intracerebral pathogenicity 
index (ICPI) and amino acid sequence at the F protein cleavage site. All 12 of 
the field isolates and five commonly used vaccine strains were selected for 
whole-genome sequencing using Ion Torrent PGM technology, yielding complete 
genome sequences for ten field isolates and all vaccine strains. The genome of 
all isolates was found to be 15 192 nt long with a high level of conservation 
across multiple genomic features with APMV-I viruses. Phylogenetic analysis and 
evolutionary distance calculations placed the isolates in genotypes II, IV and 
XIII. Revisiting other recently reported strains provided preliminary evidence 
of genotypes VI, VII and XVIII circulating in India. Comparison between the 
field and vaccine virus sequences revealed unique genomic and amino acid 
differences in important antigenic regions of the F and 
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes which can be targeted for site directed 
mutagenesis to evaluate the impact of these substitutions on virus 
pathogenicity. This study highlights the requirement to evaluate current 
vaccines through systematic protection assays to determine protection efficacy 
against field isolates.

Recent reports indicated presence of two antigenic and genetic groups (genotypes 
VI and VII) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type A in India and are 
divergent from the vaccine strains. In order to choose suitable field isolate as 
candidate vaccine strain, anti-sera against representative isolates from both 
the genotypes and two in-use vaccine strains are tested in neutralization assay. 
Two candidate vaccine strains from both the genotypes are selected with close 
antigenic match to the field isolates. From the result it is evident that IND 
81/00 (genotypes VII), gave a better antigenic coverage (antigenic relationship 
(r)-value>0.40 with 79% of isolates of 2002--2003) than IND 258/99 (genotype VI; 
r-value>0.40 with 42% of 2002--2003 isolates). Phylogenetic analysis based on P1 
genomic region placed all the recent isolates (2001--2003) into genotype VII, 
with emergence of a new variant virus (VIIb--VP3(59)del) having amino acid 
deletion at an antigenically critical residue (VP3(59)), indicating a major 
evolutionary jump probably due to immune selection. Though very limited in its 
extent, this data indicates an apparent dominance of genotype VII over genotype 
VI and underscores the need to continue further molecular epidemiological 
investigations to substantiate this finding.

Next-generation sequencing has expanded our understanding of the viral 
populations that constitute the mammalian virome. We describe a novel taxon of 
viruses named Statoviruses, for Stool associated Tombus-like viruses, present in 
multiple metagenomic datasets. These viruses define a novel clade that is 
phylogenetically related to the RNA virus families Tombusviridae and 
Flaviviridae. Five distinct statovirus types were identified in human, macaque, 
mouse, and cow gastrointestinal tract samples. The prototype genome, statovirus 
A, was frequently identified in macaque stool samples from multiple 
geographically distinct cohorts. Another genome, statovirus C1, was discovered 
in a stool sample from a human child with fever, cough, and rash. Further 
experimental data will clarify whether these viruses are infectious to mammals 
or if they originate from another source present in the mammalian 
gastrointestinal tract.

An outbreak of goose parvovirus (GPV) infection on a Swedish goose farm in the 
spring of 2004 increased the mortality rates from 2% in the early unaffected 
hatches to 90% and 99% respectively in the two hatches following virus 
introduction and 40% in goslings hatched later in the same breeding season. In 
this paper we describe the clinical observations, diagnostic procedures, and 
epidemiologic investigation carried out to elucidate the source of the 
infection. The diagnosis was confirmed by serology, virus isolation, and 
sequence analysis of a 493-bp-long fragment of the VP1 gene. Phylogenetically 
the causative virus was closely related to pathogenic GPV strains isolated in 
2003 and 2004 from Poland and the United Kingdom, respectively. The Swedish 
isolate exhibited less homology with pathogenic strains from Hungary and Asia 
and with attenuated vaccine strains. The epidemiologic investigation showed that 
the virus was first introduced to a contract farm (farm A) and then was 
transferred with newly hatched goslings to the farm that had submitted the birds 
for necropsy (index farm). The exact time and source of the virus introduction 
to farm A could not be determined with absolute certainty. Possible sources of 
the infection included backyard goose eggs that had been delivered to farm A for 
subcontract incubation and hatching, wild geese that frequented the flock of 
breeding geese on pasture on farm A, and a clutch of Canada goose eggs (Branta 
canadensis) that had been produced by wild geese and was hatched in the same 
machine as the eggs produced by farm A.

ViQuaS: an improved reconstruction pipeline for viral quasispecies spectra generated by next-generation sequencing,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Motivation: The combined effect of a high replication rate and the low fidelity of the viral polymerase in most RNA viruses and some DNA viruses results in the formation of a viral quasispecies. Uncovering information about quasispecies populations significantly benefits the study of disease progression, antiviral drug design, vaccine design and viral pathogenesis. We present a new analysis pipeline called ViQuaS for viral quasispecies spectrum reconstruction using short next-generation sequencing reads. ViQuaS is based on a novel reference-assisted de novo assembly algorithm for constructing local haplotypes. A significantly extended version of an existing global strain reconstruction algorithm is also used.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Results: Benchmarking results showed that ViQuaS outperformed three other previously published methods named ShoRAH, QuRe and PredictHaplo, with improvements of at least 3.1–53.9% in recall, 0–12.1% in precision and 0–38.2% in F-score in terms of strain sequence assembly and improvements of at least 0.006–0.143 in KL-divergence and 0.001–0.035 in root mean-squared error in terms of strain frequency estimation, over the next-best algorithm under various simulation settings. We also applied ViQuaS on a real read set derived from an in vitro human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 population, two independent datasets of foot-and-mouth-disease virus derived from the same biological sample and a real HIV-1 dataset and demonstrated better results than other methods available.</jats:p>

Mixed Triple: Allied Viruses in Unique Recent Isolates of Highly Virulent Type 2 Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Detected by Deep Sequencing,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            In February 2013, very severe acute clinical symptoms were observed in calves, heifers, and dairy cattle in several farms in North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony, Germany. Deep sequencing revealed the coexistence of three distinct genome variants within recent highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 (BVDV-2) isolates. While the major portion (ca. 95%) of the population harbored a duplication of a 222-nucleotide (nt) segment within the p7-NS2-encoding region, the minority reflected the standard structure of a BVDV-2 genome. Additionally, unusual mutations were found in both variants, within the highly conserved p7 protein and close to the p7-NS2 cleavage site. Using a reverse genetic system with a BVDV-2a strain harboring a similar duplication, it could be demonstrated that during replication, genomes without duplication are generated
            <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>
            from genomes with duplication. The major variant with duplication is compulsorily escorted by the minor variant without duplication. RNA secondary structure prediction allowed the analysis of the unique but stable mixture of three BVDV variants and also provided the explanation for their generation. Finally, our results suggest that the variant with duplication plays the major role in the highly virulent phenotype.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            This study emphasizes the importance of full-genome deep sequencing in combination with manual in-depth data analysis for the investigation of viruses in basic research and diagnostics. Here we investigated recent highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus isolates from a 2013 series of outbreaks. We discovered a unique special feature of the viral genome, an unstable duplication of 222 nucleotides which is eventually deleted by viral polymerase activity, leading to an unexpectedly mixed population of viral genomes for all investigated isolates. Our study is of high importance to the field because we demonstrate that these insertion/deletion events allow another level of genome plasticity of plus-strand RNA viruses, in addition to the well-known polymerase-induced single nucleotide variations which are generally considered the main basis for viral adaptation and evolution.

BACKGROUND: On November 20, 2016 two novel strains of H5N6 highly pathogenic 
avian influenza virus (HPAIVs) were isolated from three whooper swans (Cygnus 
cygnus) at Gangjin Bay in South Jeolla province, South Korea. Identification of 
HPAIVs in wild birds is significant as there is a potential risk of transmission 
of these viruses to poultry and humans.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Gangjin H5N6 viruses classified 
into Asian H5 clade 2.3.4.4 lineage and were distinguishable from H5N8 and H5N1 
HPAIVs previously isolated in Korea. With the exception of the polymerase acidic 
(PA) gene, the viruses were most closely related to 
A/duck/Guangdong/01.01SZSGXJK005-Y/2016 (H5N6) (98.90 ~ 99.74%). The PA genes of 
the two novel Gangjin H5N6 viruses were most closely related to AIV isolates 
previously characterized from Korea, A/hooded crane/Korea/1176/2016 (H1N1) 
(99.16%) and A/environment/Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7) (98.65%). The lack of more 
recent viruses to A/environment/Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7) indicates the need for 
analysis of recent wild bird AIVs isolated in Korea because they might provide 
further clues as to the origin of these novel reassortant H5N6 viruses.
CONCLUSIONS: Although research on the origins and epidemiology of these 
infections is ongoing, the most likely route of infection for the whooper swans 
was through direct or indirect contact with reassortant viruses shed by 
migratory wild birds in Korea. As H5N6 HPAIVs can potentially be transmitted to 
poultry and humans, continuous monitoring of AIVs among wild birds will help to 
mitigate this risk.

H1 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated from migratory birds and domestic 
ducks from 2003 to 2007 were analyzed to determine their genetic relationship. 
Phylogenic analysis with nucleotide sequences of all eight gene segments showed 
that 13 H1 AIVs from migratory birds and domestic ducks belonged to Eurasian 
avian lineages and were closely related to each other. Compared with H1 
influenza viruses of swine or human origin in Korea, there was no evidence of 
reassortment among the human, swine, and avian hosts. Our results show that H1 
AIVs isolated in Korea from 2003 to 2007 were genetically stable. However, 
continued surveillance is needed considering the role of migratory birds and 
domestic duck as a source of AIVs.

Detection of the Newcastle disease virus and its effect on development of post-vaccination immunity in a commercial flock of laying hens,"<jats:p>The aim of this study was to monitor the concentration of antibodies against Newcastle disease after vaccination of laying hens at the beginning and in the end of the laying period. The study was carried out in one commercial flock of laying hens in Opatovice in the Czech Republic in the years 2008-2010. A total of 280 samples of blood sera were taken from laying hens coming from four poultry houses. The sera were tested by the haemagglutination inhibition test according to the OIE Manual. Virological testing was conducted as a consequence of atypical results of serological testing. Newcastle disease virus RNA was proved by the RT-nested PCR method in the pooled tissue samples of 5 hens, in the samples of intestines with ileocaecal tonsila, in trachea and also in one swab sample from the environment of one house. Based on sequencing analysis and subsequent phylogenetic analysis, the virus was identified as a low pathogenic strain of paramyxovirus (PMV-1). This low pathogenic strain did not have any impact on the health of laying hens.</jats:p>",0

The Thermus sp. family of IIS/IIG/IIC enzymes includes the thermostable, 
bifunctional, fused restriction endonuclease (REase)-methyltransferases (MTase): 
TaqII, Tth111II/TthHB27I, TspGWI, TspDTI and TsoI. The enzymes are large 
proteins (approximately 120kDa), their enzymatic activities are affected by 
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), they recognise similar asymmetric cognate sites and 
cleave at a distance of 11/9 nucleotides (nt). The enzymes exhibit similarities 
of their amino acid (aa) sequences and DNA catalytic motifs. Thermus sp. enzymes 
are an example of functional aa sequence homologies among REases recognising 
different, yet related DNA sequences. The family consists of TspGWI- and 
TspDTI-subfamilies. TsoI appears to be a non-identical 'triplet', related to 
TspDTI and Tth111II/TthHB27I. The discovery of TsoI, purified from Thermus 
scotoductus, is described. This prototype, displaying a novel specificity, which 
was determined by: (i) cleavage of a reference plasmid and bacteriophage DNA, 
(ii) cleavage of custom PCR DNA substrates, (iii) run-off sequencing of cleavage 
products and (iv) shotgun cloning and sequencing of bacteriophage lambda (λ) DNA 
digested with TsoI. The enzyme recognises a degenerated 5'-TARCCA-3' sequence, 
whereas DNA strands are cut 11/9 nt downstream. The discovery of the TsoI 
prototype is of practical importance in biotechnology, as it extends the palette 
of cleavage specificities for gene cloning.

Subtype H9 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) circulating in China have aroused 
concerns for their impact on poultry and risk to public health. In this report, 
three surveys of the viruses were reported, and the hemagglutinin gene of 55 
strains of the viruses isolated in China in 2007-2009 was sequenced and 
analyzed. The results indicated that the prevalence of the viruses was rising in 
China, and most of the H9 AIVs circulating in the past decade in China belonged 
to sublineage h9.4.2. The viruses isolated in China in 2007-2009 were a little 
different from previous strains (genetic distances >7.1%). Meanwhile, a 
presumably predominant clade of the viruses circulating in China in 2007-2009 
was identified. Mutation analysis suggested that the viruses have become of 
greater risk to public health in recent years.

Contagious ecthyma is a highly contagious disease with worldwide distribution, 
which is caused by the Orf virus (ORFV) belonging to the Parapoxvirus. To study 
the alteration of host gene expression in response to ORFV infection at the 
transcriptional level, several young small-tailed Han sheep were inoculated with 
ORFV, and their oral mucosa tissue samples (T0, T3, T7 and T15) were collected 
on day 0, 3, 7 and 15 after ORFV infection respectively. RNA-seq transcriptome 
comparisons were performed, showing that 1928, 3219 and 2646 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among T3 vs. T0, T7 vs. T0, and T15 vs. 
T0 respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of the DEGs from these comparisons, 
revealed that ORFV might provoke vigorous immune response of the host cells 
during the early stage of infection. Moreover, GO and network analysis showed 
that positive and negative regulative mechanisms of apoptosis were integrated in 
the host cells through up or down-regulating the expression level of DEGs 
involved in apoptotic pathways, in order to reach a homeostasis of oral mucosa 
tissues during the exposure to ORFV infection. In conclusion, our study for the 
first time describes the direct effects of ORFV on the global host gene 
expression of its host using high-throughput RNA sequencing, which provides a 
resource for future characterizing the interaction mechanism between the 
mammalian host and ORFV.

Outbreaks of classical swine fever (CSF) have caused serious economic 
consequences in China. Phylogenetic analysis based on full-length E2 gene 
sequences showed that five classical swine fever virus (CSFV) isolates collected 
from Hunan province in 2011 and 2012, together with seven other isolates from 
neighboring provinces, Guangdong (5) and Guangxi (2), could be classified as a 
new subgenotype 2.1c, which may have been endemic in the south of China for at 
least fourteen years. Subgenotype 2.1c isolates share 90.2-94.9% and 89.9-93.8% 
nucleotide sequence similarity separately with those of subgenotype 2.1a and 
2.1b in E2 gene, which are lower than the nucleotide identities between 
subgenotype 2.1a and 2.1b (91.1-95.7%). Further analysis based on a partial E2 
gene sequence (216 nt) indicated that subgenotype 2.1c isolates are also 
circulating in Thailand. Alignment of E2 amino acid sequences showed that 
subgenotype 2.1c isolates exhibit a SPA → TPV substitution at positions 777 and 
779 compared with subgenotypes 2.1a and 2.1b.

Integrative analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs of pulmonary alveolar macrophages from piglets during H1N1 swine influenza A virus infection,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>H1N1 swine influenza A virus (H1N1 SwIV) is one key subtype of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. MiRNAs relevant with H1N1 SwIV have rarely been reported. To understand the biological functions of miRNAs during H1N1 SwIV infection, this study profiled differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in pulmonary alveolar macrophages from piglets during the H1N1 SwIV infection using a deep sequencing approach, which was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Compared to control group, 70 and 16 DE miRNAs were respectively identified on post-infection day (PID) 4 and PID 7. 56 DE miRNAs were identified between PID 4 and PID 7. Our results suggest that most host miRNAs are down-regulated to defend the H1N1 SwIV infection during the acute phase of swine influenza whereas their expression levels gradually return to normal during the recovery phase to avoid the occurrence of too severe porcine lung damage. In addition, targets of DE miRNAs were also obtained, for which bioinformatics analyses were performed. Our results would be useful for investigating the functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in human influenza because pig serves as an excellent animal model to study the pathogenesis of human influenza.</jats:p>",0

Since early 2016, the Chinese goose industry has experienced severe outbreaks of 
gout; however, the etiological factor of the disease is still unclear. Here, we 
investigated the possible involvement of viral infection in the disease. Using 
sequence-independent PCR amplification, astrovirus sequences were generated from 
a gout case. Full-length genomic sequencing and sequence analysis of three goose 
astrovirus (GoAstV) strains revealed that they belong to a new avastrovirus most 
closely related to viruses classified within species Avastrovirus 3. The GoAstV 
was detected in 16/16 gout cases collected from two provinces, supporting a 
pathogenic role for the new avastrovirus.

The present study was undertaken to detect and characterize enteric viruses 
(rotavirus, astrovirus, reovirus, and coronavirus) in breeder poults. Five 
turkey breeder flocks were selected. Faecal samples were collected from all 
flocks at 1 week of age and then every other week until the poults reached 9 
weeks of age. The faecal samples were pooled in groups of five. Of the 193 pools 
(""samples"") tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 47.2%, 
30.6%, and 10.4% samples were positive for astrovirus, rotavirus, and reovirus, 
respectively. No coronavirus was detected in any of the samples. Overall, 118 
(61.1%) samples were positive for one or more enteric viruses. Of the 118 
samples, 70 (59.3%) were positive for a single virus and 48 (40.7%) for a 
combination of viruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the polymerase gene 
showed that astroviruses clustered into two groups with sequence homology 
ranging from 85.6 to 100% at the nucleotide level. Based on NSP4 gene sequences, 
rotaviruses clustered in a group and had 96.3 to 99.9% sequence homology at the 
nucleotide level. The reoviruses, based on their S4 gene sequences, clustered in 
a single group with sequence homology of 96.9 to 100%. Differing amino acid 
sequences of all three viruses may affect the antigenicity and/or pathogenicity 
of these viruses and may merit further study. The presence of two or three 
different viruses in combination may affect the dynamics of turkey health and 
disease.

Most of the molecular epidemiological studies of foot-and-mouth disease virus 
(FMDV) are based on comparison of VP1 gene sequence. In this report, The 
nucleotide sequences of the VP1 coding region of FMDV type O strains O/HKN/3/01, 
O/HKN/5/01, O/HKN/12/01, O/HKN/7/02 and O/HKN/10/02, isolated from the disease 
outbreak that occurred in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong 
SAR) of China during 2001-2002, were determined and compared with the sequences 
of other FMDVs. The results revealed that the VP1 gene of the five isolates had 
the same nucleotide (nt) sequences (639 nt), coding for 213 amino acids, and no 
changes were found either at the critical amino acid sites 144 (Val), 148 (Leu), 
154 (Lys) and 208 (Pro) within the VP1 protein epitope (amino acids 140-160, 
200-213), or in the amino acids 145-147 comprising the arginine-glycine-aspartic 
acid (RGD) sequence that is involved in the adsorption of virus to host cell. 
Analysis of the VP1 gene nucleotide sequence revealed that the five isolates 
examined were most closely related to FMDVs found in Hong Kong from 1991 to 1999 
and Taiwan in 1997. Furthermore, although the critical amino acids on the 
antigen epitope of the prevalent Hong Kong isolates and the serotype O vaccine 
strain, O1/Manisa/Turkey/69, showed relative conservativeness, they were 
distantly related genetically, which showed that there existed variation between 
the prevalent Hong Kong FMDV strains and the vaccine strain.

Rabbit hepatitis E virus (HEV) strains have recently been isolated in several 
areas of China and in the US and France. However, the host range, distribution 
and zoonotic potential of these HEV strains remain unknown and their propagation 
in cultured cells has not yet been reported. A total of 211 4-month-old rabbits 
raised on a farm in Inner Mongolia were tested for the presence of anti-HEV 
antibodies and HEV RNA. Overall, 121 rabbits (57.3%) tested positive for 
anti-HEV antibodies, and 151 (71.6%) had detectable HEV RNA. The 174 HEV strains 
recovered from these viremic rabbits, including two distinct strains each from 
23 rabbits, differed from each other by up to 13.6% in a 412-nucleotide (nt) 
sequence within ORF2, and were 89.3-95.9% identical to the reported rabbit HEV 
strains in other provinces of China. Three representative Inner Mongolian 
strains, one each from three phylogenetic clusters, whose entire genomic 
sequences were determined, shared 79.6-96.7% identities with reported rabbit HEV 
strains within the entire or 242- to 1349-nt partial genomic sequence. Rabbit 
HEV strains recovered from liver tissues of rabbits with a high HEV load 
propagated efficiently in human cell lines (A549 and PLC/PRF/5 cells), 
suggesting the potential zoonotic risk of rabbit HEV.

In northern Western Australia in 2011 and 2012, surveillance detected a novel 
arbovirus in mosquitoes. Genetic and phenotypic analyses confirmed that the new 
flavivirus, named Fitzroy River virus, is related to Sepik virus and Wesselsbron 
virus, in the yellow fever virus group. Most (81%) isolates came from Aedes 
normanensis mosquitoes, providing circumstantial evidence of the probable 
vector. In cell culture, Fitzroy River virus replicated in mosquito (C6/36), 
mammalian (Vero, PSEK, and BSR), and avian (DF-1) cells. It also infected 
intraperitoneally inoculated weanling mice and caused mild clinical disease in 3 
intracranially inoculated mice. Specific neutralizing antibodies were detected 
in sentinel horses (12.6%), cattle (6.6%), and chickens (0.5%) in the Northern 
Territory of Australia and in a subset of humans (0.8%) from northern Western 
Australia.

Zoonotic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in industrialised countries is 
thought to be caused by transmission from wild boar, domestic pig and deer as 
reservoir hosts. The detection of HEV-specific antibodies in rats and other 
rodents has suggested that these animals may represent an additional source for 
HEV transmission to human. Recently, a novel HEV (ratHEV) was detected in Norway 
rats from Hamburg, Germany, showing the typical genome organisation but a high 
nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergence to other mammalian and to avian 
HEV strains. Here we describe the multiple detection of ratHEV RNA and 
HEV-specific antibodies in Norway rats from additional cities in north-east and 
south-west Germany. The complete genome analysis of two novel strains from 
Berlin and Stuttgart confirmed the association of ratHEV to Norway rats. The 
present data indicated a continuing existence of this virus in the rat 
populations from Berlin and Hamburg. The phylogenetic analysis of a short 
segment of the open reading frame 1 confirmed a geographical clustering of the 
corresponding sequences. Serological investigations using recombinant ratHEV and 
genotype 3 capsid protein derivatives demonstrated antigenic differences which 
might be caused by the high amino acid sequence divergence in the immunodominant 
region. The high amount of animals showing exclusively ratHEV RNA or anti-ratHEV 
antibodies suggested a non-persistent infection in the Norway rat. Future 
studies have to prove the transmission routes of the virus in rat populations 
and its zoonotic potential. The recombinant ratHEV antigen generated here will 
allow future seroepidemiological studies to differentiate ratHEV and genotype 3 
infections in humans and animals.

The hepatitis E virus (HEV) was first identified in 1990, although hepatitis 
E-like diseases in humans have been recorded for a long time dating back to the 
18th century. The HEV genotypes 1-4 have been subsequently detected in human 
hepatitis E cases with different geographical distribution and different modes 
of transmission. Genotypes 3 and 4 have been identified in parallel in pigs, 
wild boars and other animal species and their zoonotic potential has been 
confirmed. Until 2010, these genotypes along with avian HEV strains infecting 
chicken were the only known representatives of the family Hepeviridae. 
Thereafter, additional HEV-related viruses have been detected in wild boars, 
distinct HEV-like viruses were identified in rats, rabbit, ferret, mink, fox, 
bats and moose, and a distantly related agent was described from closely related 
salmonid fish. This review summarizes the characteristics of the so far known 
HEV-like viruses, their phylogenetic relationship, host association and proposed 
involvement in diseases. Based on the reviewed knowledge, a suggestion for a new 
taxonomic grouping scheme of the viruses within the family Hepeviridae is 
presented.

Rotavirus groups A to E are mainly defined by antibody reactivity to the capsid 
protein VP6. Additionally, two putative rotavirus groups (F and G) have been 
identified in birds. Here, the first nucleotide sequences of the VP6-encoding 
genome segment of group F (strain 03V0568) and group G (strain 03V0567) 
rotaviruses, both derived from chickens, are presented. The group F rotavirus is 
most closely related to avian group A and D rotaviruses, with 49.9-52.3% 
nucleotide and 36.5-39.0% amino acid sequence identity. The group G rotavirus is 
most closely related to mammalian group B rotaviruses, with 55.3-57.5% 
nucleotide and 48.2-49-9% amino acid sequence identity. The terminal sequences 
of the genome segment were similar in groups A, D and F, and in groups B and G. 
The findings indicate a long-term evolution of rotavirus groups in two separated 
clades and support the development of a sequence-based classification system for 
rotavirus groups.

The In-Feed Antibiotic Carbadox Induces Phage Gene Transcription in the Swine Gut Microbiome,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Carbadox is a quinoxaline-di-
            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>
            -oxide antibiotic fed to over 40% of young pigs in the United States that has been shown to induce phage DNA transduction
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            ; however, the effects of carbadox on swine microbiome functions are poorly understood. We investigated the
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            longitudinal effects of carbadox on swine gut microbial gene expression (fecal metatranscriptome) and phage population dynamics (fecal dsDNA viromes). Microbial metagenome, transcriptome, and virome sequences were annotated for taxonomic inference and gene function by using FIGfam (isofunctional homolog sequences) and SEED subsystems databases. When the beta diversities of microbial FIGfam annotations were compared, the control and carbadox communities were distinct 2 days after carbadox introduction. This effect was driven by carbadox-associated lower expression of FIGfams (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 66) related to microbial respiration, carbohydrate utilization, and RNA metabolism (
            <jats:italic>q</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.1), suggesting bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects within certain populations. Interestingly, carbadox treatment caused greater expression of FIGfams related to all stages of the phage lytic cycle 2 days following the introduction of carbadox (
            <jats:italic>q</jats:italic>
            ≤0.07), suggesting the carbadox-mediated induction of prophages and phage DNA recombination. These effects were diminished by 7 days of continuous carbadox in the feed, suggesting an acute impact. Additionally, the viromes included a few genes that encoded resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and beta-lactam antibiotics but these did not change in frequency over time or with treatment. The results show decreased bacterial growth and metabolism, prophage induction, and potential transduction of bacterial fitness genes in swine gut bacterial communities as a result of carbadox administration.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            FDA regulations on agricultural antibiotic use have focused on antibiotics that are important for human medicine. Carbadox is an antibiotic not used in humans but frequently used on U.S. pig farms. It is important to study possible side effects of carbadox use because it has been shown to promote bacterial evolution, which could indirectly impact antibiotic resistance in bacteria of clinical importance. Interestingly, the present study shows greater prophage gene expression in feces from carbadox-fed animals than in feces from nonmedicated animals 2 days after the initiation of in-feed carbadox treatment. Importantly, the phage genetic material isolated in this study contained genes that could provide resistance to antibiotics that are important in human medicine, indicating that human-relevant antibiotic resistance genes are mobile between bacteria via phages. This study highlights the collateral effects of antibiotics and demonstrates the need to consider diverse antibiotic effects whenever antibiotics are being used or new regulations are considered.

BACKGROUND: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is caused by growth of single or 
multiple species of pathogenic bacteria in lung tissue following stress and/or 
viral infection. Next generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR 
amplicons (NGS 16S amplicon analysis) is a powerful culture-independent open 
reference method that has recently been used to increase understanding of 
BRD-associated bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of BRD cattle. However, 
it has not yet been used to examine the microbiome of the bovine lower 
respiratory tract. The objective of this study was to use NGS 16S amplicon 
analysis to identify bacteria in post-mortem lung and lymph node tissue samples 
harvested from fatal BRD cases and clinically healthy animals. Cranial lobe and 
corresponding mediastinal lymph node post-mortem tissue samples were collected 
from calves diagnosed as BRD cases by veterinary laboratory pathologists and 
from clinically healthy calves. NGS 16S amplicon libraries, targeting the V3-V4 
region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina 
MiSeq. Quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME) was used to 
determine operational taxonomic units (OTUs) which corresponded to the 16S rRNA 
gene sequences.
RESULTS: Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma, Pasteurellaceae, and Fusobacterium were 
the most abundant OTUs identified in the lungs and lymph nodes of the calves 
which died from BRD. Leptotrichiaceae, Fusobacterium, Mycoplasma, Trueperella 
and Bacteroides had greater relative abundances in post-mortem lung samples 
collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves, compared with clinically 
healthy calves without lung lesions. Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma and 
Pasteurellaceae showed higher relative abundances in post-mortem lymph node 
samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves, compared with 
clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Two Leptotrichiaceae sequence 
contigs were subsequently assembled from bacterial DNA-enriched shotgun 
sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: The microbiomes of the cranial lung lobe and mediastinal lymph node 
from calves which died from BRD and from clinically healthy H-F calves have been 
characterised. Contigs corresponding to the abundant Leptotrichiaceae OTU were 
sequenced and found not to be identical to any known bacterial genus. This 
suggests that we have identified a novel bacterial species associated with BRD.

Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 (AIV-H9N2) has become established in domestic 
poultry in Asia and Africa. AIV-H9N2 has not been reported previously in 
Indonesia. Here we describe the presence of AIV-H9N2 in chicken farms in 
Indonesia. Ninety-nine cases were observed in various provinces in Indonesia. 
Clinical signs, pathologic lesions and egg production were recorded. 
Confirmation was made using virus isolation, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), 
and sequencing. To construct hemaglutinin (HA) phylogeny, the secondary data of 
Eurasian lineages were downloaded from GenBank. For neuraminidase, five 
sequences with the highest similarities with every sequence found in this study 
were downloaded. Phylogeny was inferred using Neighbor-Joining method in MEGA6 
package. Forty-nine AIV-H9N2-positive cases were observed, of which 35 were 
tested positive for AIV-H9N2 only. The age of the infected chickens was 
43.17 ± 16.56 weeks, and their egg production was 35.85 ± 17.80% lower than 
before outbreak. BLAST search revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the 
HA-encoding gene identified in this study shared 98% sequence identity with that 
of A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/LBM719/2014(H9N2), while its neuraminidase-encoding 
gene sequences shared 94%, 98%, and 100% identities with three different 
influenza viruses. The phylogeny shows that the HA of AIV-H9N2 found in this 
study forms distinct cluster with some Vietnam and China's sequence data. The NA 
sequence data form three distinct clusters. We conclude that AIV-H9N2 is 
widespread in many provinces in Indonesia. To lessen economic losses to the 
poultry industry, flock biosecurity and vaccination against this virus subtype 
should be implemented rapidly. Thorough and rigid AIV surveillance is paramount 
to prevent further veterinary and public health consequences of the circulation 
of this virus in Indonesia.

"Molecular identification and characterization of novel coronaviruses infecting graylag geese (Anser anser), feral pigeons (Columbia livia) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos)","<jats:p>In light of the finding of a previously unknown coronavirus as the aetiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it is probable that other coronaviruses, than those recognized to date, are circulating in animal populations. Here, the results of a screening for coronavirus are presented, using a universal coronavirus RT-PCR, of the bird species graylag goose (<jats:italic>Anser anser</jats:italic>), feral pigeon (<jats:italic>Columbia livia</jats:italic>) and mallard (<jats:italic>Anas platyrhynchos</jats:italic>). Coronaviruses were found in cloacal swab samples from all the three bird species. In the graylag goose, 40 of 163 sampled birds were coronavirus positive, whereas two of 100 sampled pigeons and one of five sampled mallards tested positive. The infected graylag geese showed lower body weights compared with virus-negative birds, suggesting clinical significance of the infection. Phylogenetic analyses performed on the replicase gene and nucleocapsid protein sequences, indicated that the novel coronaviruses described in the present study all branch off from group III coronaviruses. All the novel avian coronaviruses harboured the conserved s2m RNA structure in their 3′ untranslated region, like other previously described group III coronaviruses, and like the SARS coronavirus. Sequencing of the complete nucleocapsid gene and downstream regions of goose and pigeon coronaviruses, evidenced the presence of two additional open reading frames for the goose coronavirus with no sequence similarity to known proteins, but with predicted transmembrane domains for one of the encoded proteins, and one additional open reading frame for the pigeon coronavirus, with a predicted transmembrane domain, downstream of the nucleocapsid gene.</jats:p>",0

Bovine pestiviruses (Bovine Viral Diarrea Virus 1 (BVDV 1) and Bovine Viral 
Diarrea Virus 2 (BVDV 2)) belong to the genus Pestivirus (Flaviviridae), which 
is composed of positive stranded RNA viruses causing significant economic losses 
world-wide. We used phylogenetic and bootstrap analyses to systematically scan 
alignments of previously sequenced genomes in order to explore further the 
evolutionary mechanisms responsible for variation in the virus. Previously 
published data suggested that homologous crossover might be one of the 
mechanisms responsible for the genomic rearrangements observed in cytopathic 
(cp) strains of bovine pestiviruses. Nevertheless, homologous recombination 
involves not just homologous crossovers, but also replacement of a homologous 
region of the acceptor RNA. Furthermore, cytopathic strains represent dead paths 
in evolution, since they are isolated exclusively from the fatal cases of 
mucosal disease. Herein, we report evidence of homologous inter-genotype 
recombination in the genome of a non-cytopathic (ncp) strain of Bovine Viral 
Diarrea Virus 1, the type species of the genus Pestivirus. We also show that 
intra-genotype homologous recombination might be a common phenomenon in both 
species of Pestivirus. This evidence demonstrates that homologous recombination 
contribute to the diversification of bovine pestiviruses in nature. Implications 
for virus evolution, taxonomy and phylogenetics are discussed.

Fowlpox virus (FWPV), the type species of the genus Avipoxvirus family 
Poxviridae, is a large double-stranded DNA virus that causes fowlpox in chickens 
and turkeys. Notably, sequences of the avian retrovirus reticuloendotheliosis 
virus (REV) are frequently found integrated into the genome of FWPV. While some 
FWPV strains carry remnants of the REV long terminal repeats (LTRs), other 
strains have been shown to contain insertions of nearly the full-length REV 
provirus in their genome. In the present study we detected heterogeneous FWPV 
populations carrying the REV LTR or the near full-length REV provirus genome in 
a Merriam's wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo merriami). The bird presented 
papules distributed throughout the non-feathered areas of the head. 
Avipoxvirus-like virions were observed in the lesions by transmission electron 
microscopy and the presence of FWPV was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Metagenomic 
sequencing performed on nucleic acid extracted from the skin lesions revealed 
two FWPV genome populations carrying either a 197-nt remnant of the REV LTR or a 
7939-nt long fragment corresponding to the full-length REV provirus. Notably, 
PCR amplification using primers targeting FWPV sequences flanking the REV 
insertion site, confirmed the natural occurrence of the heterogeneous FWPV 
genome populations in one additional clinical sample from another turkey 
affected by fowlpox. Additionally, sequencing of a historical FWPV isolate 
obtained from chickens in the US in 2000 also revealed the presence of the two 
FWPV-REV genome populations. Results here demonstrate distinct FWPV populations 
containing variable segments of REV genome integrated into their genome. These 
distinct genome populations are likely a result of homologous recombination 
events that take place during FWPV replication.

Eastern Austria is neighbouring regions with ongoing West Nile virus (WNV) 
transmissions. Three human WNV infections had been diagnosed during the past 
decade in Austria. The Austrian Red Cross Blood Service (ARC-BS) started a first 
voluntary screening for WNV in blood donors from Eastern Austria by Nucleic Acid 
Testing (NAT) in June 2014. This is also the most extensive WNV surveillance 
programme in humans in Austria so far. In August 2014, one autochthonous WNV 
infection was detected in a blood donor from Vienna. By now, one in 67,800 whole 
blood donations was found to be positive for WNV RNA.

Hendra and Nipah viruses are newly emerged, zoonotic viruses and their genomes 
have nucleotide and predicted amino acid homologies placing them in the family 
Paramyxoviridae. Currently these viruses are classified in the new genus 
Henipavirus, within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae. The 
genes encoding HeV and NiV nucleocapsid proteins were cloned into the yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector pFGG3 under control of GAL7 promoter. 
A high level of expression of these proteins (18-20 mg l(-1) of yeast culture) 
was obtained. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the primary structure of 
both proteins with 92% sequence coverage obtained using MS/MS analysis. Electron 
microscopy demonstrated the assembly of typical herring-bone structures of 
purified recombinant nucleocapsid proteins, characteristic for other 
paramyxoviruses. The nucleocapsid proteins revealed stability in yeast and can 
be easily purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation. HeV 
nucleocapsid protein was detected by sera derived from fruit bats, humans, 
horses infected with HeV, and NiV nucleocapsid protein was immunodetected with 
sera from, fruit bats, humans and pigs. The development of an efficient and 
cost-effective system for generation of henipavirus nucleocapsid proteins might

          <jats:p>
            Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is a simple retrovirus that can cause hemangiomas and myeloid tumors in chickens and is currently a major economic problem in Asia. Here we characterize ALV-J strain PDRC-59831, a newly studied U.S. isolate of ALV-J. Five-day-old chicken embryos were infected with this virus, and the chickens developed myeloid leukosis and hemangiomas within 2 months after hatching. To investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis, we employed high-throughput sequencing to analyze proviral integration sites in these tumors. We found expanded clones with integrations in the
            <jats:italic>MET</jats:italic>
            gene in two of the five hemangiomas studied. This integration locus was not seen in previous work characterizing ALV-J-induced myeloid leukosis.

Common Viral Integration Sites Identified in Avian Leukosis Virus-Induced B-Cell Lymphomas,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Avian leukosis virus (ALV) induces B-cell lymphoma and other neoplasms in chickens by integrating within or near cancer genes and perturbing their expression. Four genes—

            Avian leukosis virus induces B-cell lymphomas in chickens. Earlier studies showed that ALV can induce tumors through insertional mutagenesis, and several genes have been implicated in the development of these tumors. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing to reveal the genome-wide ALV integration landscape in ALV-induced B-cell lymphomas. We find elevated levels of ALV integration near transcription start sites and use common integration site analysis to greatly expand the number of genes implicated in the development of these tumors. Interestingly, we identify several genes targeted by viral insertions that have not been previously shown to be involved in cancer.

Hepatitis E is a rare human disease in Central Europe commonly imported from 
endemic regions. For autochthonous infections a zoonotic transmission from pigs, 
deer and wild boar is assumed. Using three different RT-PCR protocols, hepatitis 
E virus (HEV) RNA was detected in 10 out of 189 (5.3%) serum samples collected 
in 1995/1996 from wild boars in Germany. Sequence analysis indicates a close 
relationship with genotype 3 isolates of pigs and humans from the Netherlands 
and Japan. The results indicate that HEV is present in Germany since more than 
10 years and that wild boar may function as a reservoir for HEV.

Genetic heterogeneity of Turkish ruminant pestiviruses was investigated by 
phylogenetic analysis of complete N(pro) encoding nucleotide sequences. A total 
of 30 virus isolates obtained from 15 provinces around the country between 1997 
and 2005 were included in the phylogenetic analysis. Virus isolates mostly 
originated from cattle with one isolate from sheep. The bovine isolates all 
belonged to BVDV-1, the sheep isolate to BVDV-2. Fifteen isolates formed a new 
subgroup within BVDV-1, tentatively named BVDV-1l. The remaining bovine isolates 
were typed as BVDV-1a (n=4), BVDV-1b (n=4), BVDV-1d (n=3), BVDV-1f (n=2) and 
BVDV-1h (n=1). The isolates allocated to BVDV-1l originated from various 
geographical regions in different years. There was no correlation between 
genetic grouping and locations where isolates were obtained. Viruses originating 
from one farm in most cases belonged to the same subgroup (n=5). This study 
indicates that the newly detected subgroup BVDV-1l is predominant and widespread 
in Turkey. Moreover, an ovine virus isolate was identified as the first member 
of BVDV-2 reported in Turkey. A serological survey using samples from western 
Turkey indicated that BVDV-2 is also present in cattle.

An Iranian field strain of chicken anemia virus (CAV), designated IR CAV, was 
isolated in the Marek's disease virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line 
MDCC-MSB1 (MSB1) culture for the first time. The full-length CAV DNA of this 
strain was cloned in the bacterial plasmid pTZ57R/T to create the molecular 
clone pTZ-CAV. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of viral proteins 
of IR CAV were compared with those of representative CAV sequences including 
reference and commercial vaccine strains. IR CAV was not related to vaccine 
strains and also found to have glutamine at positions 139 and 144 confirming 
previous studies in which such mutations were associated with a slow rate of 
virus spread in cell culture. pTZ-CAV was digested with PstI to release IR CAV 
DNA and then transfected into MSB1 cell by electroporation. The transfected 
cells showed cytopathic effect similar to virion-initiated infection. One-day 
old specific pathogen-free chicks were inoculated with the regenerated virus, 
which had been obtained from transfected MSB1 cells, and compared with the 
chicks inoculated with IR CAV. Gross lesions in the birds inoculated with the 
regenerated virus illustrated the infectious nature of the regenerated virus 
from the cloned IR CAV DNA.

Partial sequence of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene of fowl adenoviruses: A reference panel for a general diagnostic PCR in poultry,"<jats:p>Adenoviruses are frequent infectious agents in different poultry species. The traditional, serological typing of new isolates by virus neutralisation tests is now in transition to be replaced by PCR and sequencing. The first PCRs, recommended for the detection of adenoviruses, had been designed to target the gene of the major capsid protein, the hexon. In birds, members of three different genera of the family<jats:italic>Adenoviridae</jats:italic>may occur. Accordingly, three specific hexon PCRs had to be elaborated for the detection of adenoviruses in poultry. A significantly more sensitive PCR, targeting the viral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene, has been described recently. This method proved to be an efficient alternative for the general detection of adenoviruses irrespective of their genus affiliation. Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs), isolated from chicken to date, comprise twelve serotypes classified into five virus species (FAdV-A to E). The polymerase gene sequence has been determined yet only from three FAdV types representing three species. In the present work, the panel of polymerase gene sequences was completed with those of the rest of FAdVs. The newly determined sequences will facilitate the identification of new FAdV isolates as an existing species or as a putative new FAdV. Once the polymerase sequence is known, more specific PCRs for the amplification of the hexon and other genes can be designed and performed according to the preliminary species classification.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is classified into the genus 
Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. JEV can cause febrile illness and 
encephalitis mainly in humans and horses, and occasionally in cattle.
CASE PRESENTATION: In late September 2010, a 114-month-old cow showed 
neurological symptoms similar to the symptoms observed in previous bovine cases 
of Japanese encephalitis (JE); therefore, we conducted virological and 
pathological tests on the cow. As a result, JEV was isolated from the cerebrum 
of the affected cow. We determined the complete genome sequence of the JEV 
isolate, which we named JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010, including the envelope (E) gene 
region and 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Our phylogenetic analyses of the E 
region and complete genome showed that the isolate belongs to JEV genotype 1 
(G1). The isolate, JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010, was most closely related to several JEV 
G1 isolates in Toyama Prefecture, Japan in 2007-2009 by the phylogenetic 
analysis of the E region. In addition, the nucleotide alignment revealed that 
the deletion in the 3'UTR was the same between JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010 and several 
other JEV G1 isolates identified in Toyama Prefecture in 2008-2009. A 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was conducted for the detection of 
anti-JEV antibodies in the affected cow, and the test detected 2-mercaptoethanol 
(2-ME)-sensitive HI antibodies against JEV in the serum of the affected cow. The 
histopathological investigation revealed nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis in the 
affected cow, and the immunohistochemical assay detected JEV antigen in the 
cerebrum.
CONCLUSION: We diagnosed the case as JE of a cow based on the findings of 
nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis observed in the central nervous system, JEV 
antigen detected in the cerebrum, JEV isolated from the cerebrum, and 
2-ME-sensitive HI antibodies against JEV detected in the serum. This is the 
first reported case of JE in a cow over 24 months old.

Genetic reclassification of porcine enteroviruses,"<jats:p>The genetic diversity of porcine teschoviruses (PTVs; previously named porcine enterovirus 1) and most serotypes of porcine enteroviruses (PEVs) was studied. Following the determination of the major portion of the genomic sequence of PTV reference strain Talfan, the nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, the capsid VP2 region and the 3′ non-translated region (3′-NTR) were compared among PTVs and PEVs and with other picornaviruses. The sequences were obtained by RT–PCR and 3′-RACE with primers based on the sequences of Talfan and available PEV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of RdRp/VP2 and analysis of the predicted RNA secondary structure of the 3′-NTR indicated that PEVs should be reclassified genetically into at least three groups, one that should be assigned to PTVs and two PEV subspecies represented by strain PEV-8 V13 and strain PEV-9 UKG410/73.</jats:p>",0

Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious viral disease 
causing severe economic losses in the poultry industry. The 793/B IB virus is an 
important infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genotype currently circulating in 
several countries, including Iran. One hundred confirmed IBV samples (between 
2014 and 2015; from 15 provinces in Iran) were selected for genotyping based on 
S1 sequencing. After phylogenetic analysis, it was found that 30% of the IBV 
isolates belonged to the 793/B genotype. Results showed that the Iranian 
793/B-like IBV isolates could be divided in to three clusters: 4/91-like (50%), 
1/96-like (40%), and IB88-like (10%). The sequence similarity between Iranian 
793/B-like IBV isolates is 87.69%-100%. The highest identity is between the 4/91 
and IB88 clusters (96.38%), and the lowest similarity is between the 1/96 and 
IB88 clusters (87.62%). This study provides a comprehensive analysis of 
793/B-type IBV in Iran and characterization of IBV molecular epidemiology in the 
country.

Zoonotic agents challenging the world every year afresh are influenza A viruses. 
In the past, human pandemics caused by influenza A viruses had been occurring 
periodically. Wild aquatic birds are carriers of the full variety of influenza 
virus A subtypes, and thus, most probably constitute the natural reservoir of 
all influenza A viruses. Whereas avian influenza viruses in their natural avian 
reservoir are generally of low pathogenicity (LPAIV), some have gained virulence 
by mutation after transmission and adaptation to susceptible gallinaceous 
poultry. Those so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) then 
cause mass die-offs in susceptible birds and lead to tremendous economical 
losses when poultry is affected. Besides a number of avian influenza virus 
subtypes that have sporadically infected mammals, the HPAIV H5N1 Asia shows 
strong zoonotic characteristics and it was transmitted from birds to different 
mammalian species including humans. Theoretically, pandemic viruses might derive 
directly from avian influenza viruses or arise after genetic reassortment 
between viruses of avian and mammalian origin. So far, HPAIV H5N1 already meets 
two conditions for a pandemic virus: as a new subtype it has been hitherto 
unseen in the human population and it has infected at least 438 people, and 
caused severe illness and high lethality in 262 humans to date (August 2009). 
The acquisition of efficient human-to-human transmission would complete the 
emergence of a new pandemic virus. Therefore, fighting H5N1 at its source is the 
prerequisite to reduce pandemic risks posed by this virus. Other influenza 
viruses regarded as pandemic candidates derive from subtypes H2, H7, and H9 all 
of which have infected humans in the past. Here, we will give a comprehensive 
overview on avian influenza viruses in concern to their zoonotic potential.

Hospital of Dijon, Dijon, France.

AIMS: To characterize major enteric viruses (enterovirus, rotavirus, norovirus, 
astrovirus and adenovirus) in the sewage of Greater Cairo and to compare the 
results with clinical data collected during the same period.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-two sewage samples from two waste water treatment 
plants were collected from April 2006 through February 2007. Enteroviruses, 
noroviruses (NoVs) and rotaviruses (RVs) were detected by RT-PCR in 22%, 18% and 
8.3% of the samples, respectively. No adenovirus and astrovirus was detected. 
G2P[8], G9P[8], G1P[8], G2P[4] and rare G12 RV isolates were detected in the 
environment as well as a bovine RV. The environmental NoV strains mostly 
belonged to genogroup I (84%). Rotaviruses and some of the NoVs were similar to 
those found in the clinical samples at the same time.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of environmental and clinical data suggests that 
similar RV and NoV isolates were circulating in the environment and in the 
population during the same period.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Few studies have investigated the 
prevalence and the epidemiology of RVs and NoVs in Cairo. This work is the first 
to establish a correlation between viral gastroenteritis and the concomitant 
presence of enteric viruses in the environment for Greater Cairo where combined 
environmental and clinical surveys should help to prevent infections caused by 
these major pathogens.

Given the major threat of influenza A to human and animal health, and its 
ability to evolve rapidly through mutation and reassortment, tools that enable 
its timely characterization are necessary to help monitor its evolution and 
spread. For this purpose, deep sequencing can be a very valuable tool. This 
study reports a comprehensive method that enables deep sequencing of the 
complete genomes of influenza A subtypes using the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx 
(GAIIx). By using this method, the complete genomes of nine viruses were 
sequenced in parallel, representing the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, H5N1 virus 
from human and H1N1 virus from swine, on a single lane of a GAIIx flow cell to 
an average depth of 122-fold. This technique can be applied to cultivated and 
uncultivated virus.

"Nucleotide sequence of avian carcinoma virus MH2: two potential onc genes, one related to avian virus MC29 and the other related to murine sarcoma virus 3611.","<jats:p>The 5.2-kilobase (kb) RNA genome of avian carcinoma virus MH2 has the genetic structure 5'-delta gag (0.2 kb)- mht (1.2 kb)-myc (1.4 kb)-c (0.4 kb)-poly(A) (0.2 kb)-3'. delta gag is a partial retroviral core protein gene, mht and myc are cell-derived MH2-specific sequences, and c is the 3'-terminal retroviral vector sequence. Here we have determined the nucleotide sequence of 3.5 kb from the 3' end of delta gag to the 3' end of molecularly cloned proviral MH2 DNA, in order to elucidate the genetic structure of the virus and to compare it with other mht - and myc-containing oncogenic viruses as well as with the chicken proto-myc gene. The following results were obtained: (i) delta gag- mht forms a hybrid gene with a contiguous reading frame of 2682 nucleotides that terminates with a stop codon near the 3' end of mht . The 3' 969 nucleotides of mht up to the stop codon are 80% sequence related to the onc-specific raf sequence of murine sarcoma virus 3611 (94% homologous at the deduced amino acid level). (ii) The myc sequence is preceded by an RNA splice acceptor site shared with the cellular proto-myc gene, beyond which it is colinear up to a 3'-termination codon and 40 noncoding nucleotides with the myc sequences of avian retrovirus MC29 and chicken proto-myc. Thus, myc forms, together with a 5' retroviral exon, a second MH2-specific gene. (iii) myc is followed by the 3'-terminal c region of about 400 nucleotides, which is colinear with that of Rous sarcoma virus except for a substitution near the 5' end of the long terminal repeat. It is concluded that MH2 contains two genes with oncogenic potential, the delta gag- mht gene, which is closely related to the delta gag-raf transforming gene of MSV 3611, and the myc gene, which is related to the transforming gene of MC29. Furthermore, it may be concluded that the cellular proto-onc genes, which on sequence transduction become viral onc genes, are a small group because among the 19 known onc sequences, 5 are shared by different taxonomic groups of viruses of which the mht /raf homology is the closest determined so far.</jats:p>",0
"Impact of Coxsackievirus A6 emergence on hand, foot, and mouth disease epidemic in Osaka City, Japan","<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute febrile illness characterized by fever; sore throat; and vesicular eruptions on the hands, feet, and oral mucosa. Until 2010, HFMD was predominantly associated with enterovirus (EV) A71 and coxsackievirus (CV) A16 in Japan. In 2011, CV‐A6 emerged as a primary causative agent, causing the largest HFMD epidemic in Japan since 1981. Since then, CV‐A6 has caused large HFMD epidemics every 2 years. The phylogenetic analysis of complete Viral Protein 1 (VP1) sequences revealed that most CV‐A6 strains detected from 2011 to 2015 in Osaka City were classified into a different clade compared with CV‐A6 strains detected from 1999 until 2009. The majority of CV‐A6 strains detected in 2011 and most CV‐A6 strains detected from 2013 to 2015 were mainly divided into two distinct genetic groups. Each epidemic strain carried unique amino acid substitutions in the presumed DE, EF, and GH loops of the VP1 protein that is exposed on the surface of the virion. There is a possibility that the appearance of substitutions on the surface of the virion and an accumulation of a susceptible population are significant factors in recent HFMD epidemics.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

A newly emerged H5N8 influenza virus was isolated from green-winged teal in 
Egypt during December 2016. In this study, we provide a detailed 
characterization of full genomes of Egyptian H5N8 viruses and some virological 
features. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the Egyptian H5N8 viruses are 
highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 
the genome of the Egyptian H5N8 viruses was related to recently characterized 
reassortant H5N8 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4 isolated from different Eurasian 
countries. Multiple peculiar mutations were characterized in the Egyptian H5N8 
viruses, which probably permits transmission and virulence of these viruses in 
mammals. The Egyptian H5N8 viruses preferentially bound to avian-like receptors 
rather than human-like receptors. Also, the Egyptian H5N8 viruses were fully 
sensitive to amantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors. Chicken sera raised 
against commercial inactivated avian influenza-H5 vaccines showed no or very low 
reactivity with the currently characterized H5N8 viruses in agreement with the 
genetic dissimilarity. Surveillance of avian influenza in waterfowl provides 
early warning of specific threats to poultry and human health and hence should 
be continued.

Reassortant swine influenza viruses isolated in Japan contain genes from pandemic A(H1N1) 2009,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>In 2013, three reassortant swine influenza viruses (SIVs)—two H1N2 and one H3N2—were isolated from symptomatic pigs in Japan; each contained genes from the pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 virus and endemic SIVs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two H1N2 viruses, A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 and A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013, were reassortants that contain genes from the following three distinct lineages: (i) H1 and nucleoprotein (NP) genes derived from a classical swine H1 HA lineage uniquely circulating among Japanese SIVs; (ii) neuraminidase (NA) genes from human‐like H1N2 swine viruses; and (iii) other genes from pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses. The H3N2 virus, A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013, comprised genes from two sources: (i) hemagglutinin (HA) and NA genes derived from human and human‐like H3N2 swine viruses and (ii) other genes from pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that each of the reassortants may have arisen independently in Japanese pigs. A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 were found to have strong antigenic reactivities with antisera generated for some seasonal human‐lineage viruses isolated during or before 2003, whereas A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 reactivities with antisera against viruses isolated after 2004 were clearly weaker. In addition, antisera against some strains of seasonal human‐lineage H1 viruses did not react with either A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 or A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013. These findings indicate that emergence and spread of these reassortant SIVs is a potential public health risk.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

The present study was conducted to monitor wild birds based on the concern that 
they could disseminate avian influenza virus (AIV) between Mongolia and Korea, 
which shares the same migratory flyway. Of 1,528 fecal samples analyzed, 21 
low-pathogenic AIV were isolated from 2007 to 2009. Nineteen AIV-positive fecal 
samples were identified as Anseriformes by DNA bar coding. The most frequently 
isolated subtype was H3 (61.9%), and the most prevalent 
hemagglutinin/neuraminidase combination was H3N8 (52.4%). Phylogenetic analysis 
was performed to assess their genetic relationships with those of domestic 
poultry and wild birds in Korea. The H3 and H7 surface genes belonged to the 
Eurasian lineage and clustered together in a group with Korean wild birds and 
poultry. Most N8 genes clustered phylogenetically with viruses isolated in 
Eurasia, whereas 1 of the Mongolian viruses and some Korean viruses belonged to 
the North American lineage. The polymerase acidic protein of the internal gene 
was not distinguishable from the H5N1 highly pathogenic AIV of the 
goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (Gs/Gd)-like virus. Our study suggests that Mongolian AIV 
isolates have evolved with genetically multiple genotypes and are closely 
related to those of AIV in poultry as well as in wild birds in Korea.

Phylogenetic relationships and pathogenicity variation of two Newcastle disease viruses isolated from domestic ducks in Southern China,"1. Virol J. 2014 Aug 12;11:147. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-11-147.

BACKGROUND: Newcastle disease (ND) is an OIE listed disease caused by virulent 
avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) strains, which is enzootic and causes large 
economic losses in the poultry sector. Genotype VII and genotype IX NDV viruses 
were the predominant circulating genotype in China, which may possibly be 
responsible for disease outbreaks in chicken flocks in recent years. While ducks 
and geese usually have exhibited inapparent infections.
METHODS: In the present study, we investigate the complete genome sequence, the 
clinicopathological characterization and transmission of two virulent Newcastle 
disease viruses, SS-10 and NH-10, isolated from domestic ducks in Southern China 
in 2010.
RESULTS: F, and the complete gene sequences based on phylogenetic analysis 
demonstrated that SS-10 (genotype VII) and NH-10 (genotype IX) belongs to class 
II. The deduced amino acid sequence was (112)R-R-Q-K/R-R-F(117) at the fusion 
protein cleavage site. Animal experiment results showed that the SS-10 virus 
isolated from ducks was highly pathogenic for chickens and geese, but low 
pathogenic for ducks. It could be detected from spleen, lung, kidney, trachea, 
small intestine, bursa of fabricius, thymus, pancreas and cecal tonsils, 
oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, and could transmit to the naive contact birds. 
Moreover, it could transmit to chickens, ducks and geese by naive contact. 
However, the NH-10 virus isolated from ducks could infect some chickens, ducks 
and geese, but only caused chickens to die. Additionally, it could transmit to 
the naive contact chickens, ducks, and geese.
CONCLUSION: The two NDV isolates exhibited different biological properties with 
respect to pathogenicity and transmission in chickens, ducks and geese. 
Therefore, no species-preference exists for chicken, duck or goose viruses and 
more attention should be paid to the trans-species transmission of VII NDVs 
between ducks, geese and chickens for the control and eradication of ND.

Although Newcastle disease virus (NDV) with high pathogenicity has frequently 
been isolated in poultry in China since 1948, the mode of its transmission among 
avian species remains largely unknown. Given that various wild bird species have 
been implicated as sources of transmission, in this study we genotypically and 
pathotypically characterized 23 NDV isolates collected from chickens, ducks, and 
pigeons in live bird markets (LBMs) in South China as part of an H7N9 
surveillance program during December 2013-February 2014. To simulate the natural 
transmission of different kinds of animals in LBMs, we selected three 
representative NDVs-namely, GM, YF18, and GZ289-isolated from different birds to 
evaluate the pathogenicity and transmission of the indicated viruses in 
chickens, ducks, and pigeons. Furthermore, to investigate the replication and 
shedding of NDV in poultry, we inoculated the chickens, ducks, and pigeons with 
10(6) EID50 of each virus via intraocular and intranasal routes. Eight hour 
after infection, the naïve contact groups were housed with those inoculated with 
each of the viruses as a means to monitor contact transmission. Our results 
indicated that genetically diverse viruses circulate in LBMs in South China's 
Guangdong Province and that NDV from different birds have different tissue 
tropisms and host ranges when transmitted in different birds. We therefore 
propose the continuous epidemiological surveillance of LBMs to support the 
prevention of the spread of these viruses in different birds, especially 
chickens, and highlight the need for studies of the virus-host relationship.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections occur in swine worldwide. The porcine 
infection is usually subclinical, but HEV genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic agents 
that cause sporadic, indigenous human cases of hepatitis E. The aims of this 
study were to investigate the occurrence and dynamics of HEV infections in young 
pigs by analyzing a total of 273 fecal samples collected from six farrowing 
farms, to genetically characterize the HEV isolates obtained, and to examine the 
phylogenetic relationships of HEV isolates occurring at different swine farms in 
Finland. Fecal shedding of HEV of individual piglets was followed at two farms 
that were selected from five farms identified as HEV RNA positive. Excretion of 
HEV was detected in 87.5% of the piglets during the survey. Piglets contracted 
primary HEV infection 3-8 weeks after weaning, and at the time they were 
transferred to fattening farms, practically all (96.6%) of the pigs with a 
sample available at this occasion still excreted the virus. According to 
phylogenetic analysis, all HEV isolates obtained belonged to HEV genotype 3, 
subtype e, and a separate, farm-specific isolate originated from 10 of 11 farms 
examined. The results of our study show that HEV infections are highly common in 
young pigs, and HEV RNA-positive pigs enable HEV transmission from farrowing to 
fattening farms, creating a possible risk of infection for pig handlers, and 
that genetic variations in HEVs originating from different farms occur.

In epidemiology, the identification of 'who infected whom' allows us to quantify 
key characteristics such as incubation periods, heterogeneity in transmission 
rates, duration of infectiousness, and the existence of high-risk groups. 
Although invaluable, the existence of many plausible infection pathways makes 
this difficult, and epidemiological contact tracing either uncertain, 
logistically prohibitive, or both. The recent advent of next-generation 
sequencing technology allows the identification of traceable differences in the 
pathogen genome that are transforming our ability to understand high-resolution 
disease transmission, sometimes even down to the host-to-host scale. We review 
recent examples of the use of pathogen whole-genome sequencing for the purpose 
of forensic tracing of transmission pathways, focusing on the particular 
problems where evolutionary dynamics must be supplemented by epidemiological 
information on the most likely timing of events as well as possible transmission 
pathways. We also discuss potential pitfalls in the over-interpretation of these 
data, and highlight the manner in which a confluence of this technology with 
sophisticated mathematical and statistical approaches has the potential to 
produce a paradigm shift in our understanding of infectious disease transmission 
and control.

Next generation sequencing technologies: tool to study avian virus diversity.

Kapgate SS, Barbuddhe SB, Kumanan K.

Increased globalisation, climatic changes and wildlife-livestock interface led 
to emergence of novel viral pathogens or zoonoses that have become serious 
concern to avian, animal and human health. High biodiversity and bird migration 
facilitate spread of the pathogen and provide reservoirs for emerging infectious 
diseases. Current classical diagnostic methods designed to be virus-specific or 
aim to be limited to group of viral agents, hinder identifying of novel viruses 
or viral variants. Recently developed approaches of next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) provide culture-independent methods that are useful for understanding 
viral diversity and discovery of novel virus, thereby enabling a better 
diagnosis and disease control. This review discusses the different possible 
steps of a NGS study utilizing sequence-independent amplification, 
high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches to identify novel avian 
viruses and their diversity. NGS lead to the identification of a wide range of 
new viruses such as picobirnavirus, picornavirus, orthoreovirus and avian gamma 
coronavirus associated with fulminating disease in guinea fowl and is also used 
in describing viral diversity among avian species. The review also briefly 
discusses areas of viral-host interaction and disease associated causalities 
with newly identified avian viruses.

Poultry parvoviruses identified during the early 1980s are found worldwide in 
intestines from young birds with enteric disease syndromes as well as healthy 
birds. The chicken parvovirus (ChPV) and turkey parvovirus (TuPV) belong to the 
Aveparvovirus genus within the subfamily Parvovirinae. Poultry parvoviruses are 
small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses consisting of three open 
reading frames, the first two encoding the non-structural protein (NS) and 
nuclear phosphoprotein (NP) and the third encoding the viral capsid proteins 1 
(VP1 and VP2). In contrast to other parvoviruses, the VP1-unique region does not 
contain the phospholipase A2 sequence motif. Recent experimental studies 
suggested the parvoviruses to be the candidate pathogens in cases of enteric 
disease syndrome. Current diagnostic methods for poultry parvovirus detection 
include PCR, real-time PCR, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant 
VP2 or VP1 capsid proteins. Moreover, sequence-independent amplification 
techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms have allowed rapid 
and simultaneous detection of the parvovirus from affected and healthy birds. 
There is no commercial vaccine; hence, the development of an effective vaccine 
to control the spread of infection should be of primary importance. This review 
presents the current knowledge on poultry parvoviruses with emphasis on 
taxonomy, phylogenetic relationship, genomic analysis, epidemiology, 
pathogenesis and diagnostic methods.

Multiple novel astrovirus species in human stool,"<jats:p>Diarrhoea remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries where numerous cases remain without identified aetiology. Astroviruses are a recently identified cause of animal gastroenteritis which currently includes two species suspected of causing human diarrhoea. Using pan-astrovirus RT-PCR, we analysed human stool samples from different continents for astrovirus-related RNA sequences. We identified variants of the two known human astrovirus species plus, based on genetic distance criteria, three novel astrovirus species all distantly related to mink and ovine astroviruses, which we provisionally named HMOAstV species A–C. The complete genome of species A displayed all the conserved characteristics of mammalian astroviruses. Each of the now three groups of astroviruses found in human stool (HAstV, AstV-MLB and HMOAstV) were more closely related to animal astroviruses than to each other, indicating that human astroviruses may periodically emerge from zoonotic transmissions. Based on the pathogenic impact of their closest phylogenetic relatives in animals, further investigations of the role of HMOAstV, so far detected in Nigeria, Nepal and Pakistan, in human gastroenteritis are warranted.</jats:p>",0

Human enteroviruses are associated with various clinical syndromes from minor 
febrile illness to severe, potentially fatal conditions like aseptic meningitis, 
paralysis, myocarditis, and neonatal enteroviral sepsis. Between June 2000 and 
August 2008 echovirus (E) type 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 25, 30, coxsackievirus 
(CV) -A16, -A19, -B5, and enterovirus 71 (EV71) were reported in Hungary. In 
this study, 29 previously enterovirus positive samples from 28 patients 
diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease, meningitis and encephalitis, were 
molecularly typed. The genetic relationships of identified serotypes CV-A16, 
EV71, and E30 were assessed by direct sequencing of genomic region encoding the 
capsid protein VP1. The sequences were compared to each other and sequences from 
other geographical regions possessed in Genbank. The phylogenetic analysis of 
CV-A16 revealed that the viruses were mostly of Far-Eastern or Asia-Pacific 
origin. Typing of EV71 showed that one virus from 2000 belonged to genotype C1 
and five viruses observed in 2004 and 2005 were identified as genotype C4. The 
11 echovirus 30 strains showed homology with those of neighbor European 
countries. The molecular examination of E30 revealed that three separate 
lineages circulated in 2000, 2001, and 2004-2006 in Hungary.

Since 1998, H3N2 viruses have caused epizootics of respiratory disease in pigs 
throughout the major swine production regions of the U.S. These outbreaks are 
remarkable because swine influenza in North America had previously been caused 
almost exclusively by H1N1 viruses. We sequenced the full-length protein coding 
regions of all eight RNA segments from four H3N2 viruses that we isolated from 
pigs in the Midwestern U.S. between March 1998 and March 1999, as well as from 
H3N2 viruses recovered from a piglet in Canada in January 1997 and from a pig in 
Colorado in 1977. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the 1977 Colorado and 
1997 Ontario isolates are wholly human influenza viruses. However, the viruses 
isolated since 1998 from pigs in the Midwestern U.S. are reassortant viruses 
containing hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and PB1 polymerase genes from human 
influenza viruses, matrix, non-structural and nucleoprotein genes from classical 
swine viruses, and PA and PB2 polymerase genes from avian viruses. The HA 
proteins of the Midwestern reassortant swine viruses can be differentiated from 
those of the 1995 lineage of human H3 viruses by 12 amino acid mutations in HA1. 
In contrast, the Sw/ONT/97 virus, which did not spread from pig-to-pig, lacks 11 
of these changes.

Neonatal porcine diarrhoea of uncertain aetiology has been reported from a 
number of European countries. The aim of the present study was to use viral 
metagenomics to examine a potential viral involvement in this diarrhoea and to 
describe the intestinal virome with focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from 
the distal jejunum of 50 diarrhoeic and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected 
herds were analysed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic 
acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence independent 
amplification. Samples from diarrhoeic piglets from the same herds were pooled 
whereas samples from healthy piglets were analysed individually. In total, 29 
clinical samples, plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting 
of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The 
resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, 
Diamond and HMMER. In the healthy specimens, eight different mammalian virus 
families were detected (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, 
Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) 
compared to four in the pooled diarrhoeic samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, 
Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae). It was not possible to associate a particular 
virus family with the investigated diarrhoea. In conclusion, this study does not 
support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhoea was caused by known 
mammalian viruses. The results do, however, indicate that known mammalian 
viruses were present in the intestine as early as 24-48 hours after birth, 
indicating immediate infection post-partum or possibly transplacental infection.

The existing H1N1 (2009) swine flu is pandemic in nature and is responsible for 
global economic losses and fatalities. Among the eight gene segments of H1N1, 
hemagglutinin (HA) plays a major role in the attachment of the virus to the host 
cell surface and entry of viral RNA into the host cell leads to infection. In 
this study, sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the H1N1 (2009) HA, from 
Mexico City along with 1952 sequences, from different subtypes of pandemic 
influenza A virus were studied and results showed that the closest relationship 
of H1N1 (2009) Mexico strain was with the H1N1 (2007) Mallard Norway strain. 
Analysis of secondary structures predicted from the protein sequence revealed 
that diminishing of alpha helixes was observed in many areas of the sequences 
between the years 2005 to 2010. Conversely, analysis at the structural level is 
necessary to critically assess the functional significance. Structural level 
investigation was therefore done for the above said proteins by constructing the 
3D structure of these proteins through homology modeling. The models were 
validated and structural level similarities were evaluated through 
superimposition. Subsequently, docking studies were done to find the binding 
mode of the sialic acid (SA) with influenza HA. Molecular dynamics simulations 
were executed to study the interactions of SA molecule with the HA. Energetic 
analysis reveals that van der Waal interaction is more favorable for binding of 
HA with SA of the whole influenza virus. Binding pocket analysis shows that 
intensities of H-bond donor and acceptor are more in H1N1 (2009).

Possible risks posed by single‐stranded <scp>DNA</scp> viruses of pigs associated with xenotransplantation,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Routine large‐scale xenotransplantation from pigs to humans is getting closer to clinical reality owing to several state‐of‐the‐art technologies, especially the ability to rapidly engineer genetically defined pigs. However, using pig organs in humans poses risks including unwanted cross‐species transfer of viruses and adaption of these pig viruses to the human organ recipient. Recent developments in the field of virology, including the advent of metagenomic techniques to characterize entire viromes, have led to the identification of a plethora of viruses in many niches. Single‐stranded <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DNA</jats:styled-content> (ss<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DNA</jats:styled-content>) viruses are the largest group prevalent in virome studies in mammals. Specifically, the ss<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DNA</jats:styled-content> viral genomes are characterized by a high rate of nucleotide substitution, which confers a proclivity to adapt to new hosts and cross‐species barriers. Pig‐associated ss<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DNA</jats:styled-content> viruses include torque teno sus viruses (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">TTS</jats:styled-content>uV) in the <jats:italic>Anelloviridae</jats:italic> family, porcine parvoviruses (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PPV</jats:styled-content>), and porcine bocaviruses (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PB</jats:styled-content>oV) both in the family of <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic>, and porcine circoviruses (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PCV</jats:styled-content>) in the <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic> family, some of which have been confirmed to be pathogenic to pigs. The risks of these viruses for the human recipient during xenotransplantation procedures are relatively unknown. Based on the scant knowledge available on the prevalence, predilection, and pathogenicity of pig‐associated ss<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DNA</jats:styled-content> viruses, careful screening and monitoring are required. In the case of positive identification, risk assessments and strategies to eliminate these viruses in xenotransplantation pig stock may be needed.</jats:p>",0

The G gene encoding the neutralization antigen of bovine ephemeral fever virus 
(BEFV) was characterized in order to define the virus's molecular epidemiology 
in Japan and the genetic relationships among the Japanese, Taiwanese and 
Australian isolates. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the gene were 
highly conserved among the Japanese strains, regardless of the year of 
isolation, and were closely related to the Taiwanese strains. By phylogenetic 
analysis, the Japanese and Taiwanese strains were classified clearly into three 
chronological clusters: 1966, 1984-1989 and 1996-2004, indicating that the 
epidemics of bovine ephemeral fever may occur almost simultaneously in both 
countries by the same genotype. On the other hand, the Australian strains were 
distantly related to these East Asian strains and placed in the independent 
fourth cluster of the phylogenetic tree. It is suggested that three amino acid 
substitutions at residues 224, 271 and 499 in the neutralizing epitopes, of 
which two generate new glycosylation sequences, are responsible for antigenic 
variations of bovine ephemeral fever virus. The cross-neutralization test using 
the bovine ephemeral fever virus isolated in Japan demonstrated that the vaccine 
developed based on the oldest Japanese strain, YHL, appears to still be 
effective for controlling bovine ephemeral fever in Japan.

Rotavirus infection is a worldwide problem, with occurrence of highly divergent 
viruses classified in 8 species (A-H). We report here the evolution assessment 
of codon usage patterns in virus-host system in avian rotavirus (AvRV) of 
species RVA, RVD, RVF and RVG (preferentially affecting birds). The nucleotide 
contents, codon usage bias (CUB), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and 
effective number of codons (ENCs) values were investigated targeting 
overexpressing major inner capsid viral protein (VP6) of these AvRV species. The 
results confirm that the evolutionary characteristics influences the rotavirus 
(RV) genetic diversity and impact of host's natural selection on the AvRVs 
codons. Synonymous codon usage patterns were evaluated following multivariate 
statistical procedures on all available AvRV coding gene sequences. RSCU trees 
accommodated all AvRV species and preferred host sequences in one topology 
confirming greater imminence of AvRVs with the host chicken cell genes. 
Similarly, the codon adaptation index (CAI) results also displayed a higher 
adaptation of AvRVs to its chicken host. The codon preference analysis of RVs 
revealed that VP6 gene express more proficiently in the yeast system, whereas, 
codon optimization might be required for the effectual expression in Escherichia 
coli and Homo sapiens. The findings provide basic evidence on the dynamics of 
AvRV evolution and its host adaptation, which could be exploited for additional 
research on avian species in future.

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are currently 
a topic of interest in microbiology due to their role as a prokaryotic immune 
system. Investigations of CRISPR distribution and characterization to date have 
focused on pathogenic bacteria, while less is known about CRISPR in commensal 
bacteria, where they may have a significant role in the ecology of the 
microbiota of humans and other animals, and act as a recorder of interactions 
between bacteria and viruses. A combination of PCR and sequencing was used to 
determine prevalence and distribution of CRISPR arrays in Enterococcus faecalis 
and Enterococcus hirae isolates from the feces of healthy pigs. Both type II 
CRISPR-Cas and Orphan CRISPR (without Cas genes) were detected in the 195 
isolates examined. CRISPR-Cas was detected in 52 (46/88) and 42 % (45/107) E. 
faecalis and E. hirae isolates, respectively. The prevalence of Orphan CRISPR 
arrays was higher in E. faecalis isolates (95 %, 84/88) compared with E. hirae 
isolates (49 %, 53/107). Species-specific repeat sequences were identified in 
Orphan CRISPR arrays, and 42 unique spacer sequences were identified. Only two 
spacers matched previously characterized pig virome sequences, and many were 
apparently derived from chromosomal sequences of enterococci. Surprisingly, 17 
(40 %) of the spacers were detected in both species. Shared spacer sequences are 
evidence of a lack of species specificity in the agents and mechanisms 
responsible for integration of spacers, and the abundance of spacer sequences 
corresponding to bacterial chromosomal sequences reflects interspecific 
interactions within the intestinal microbiota.

Insights into the bovine rumen plasmidome,"<jats:p>Plasmids are self-replicating genetic elements capable of mobilization between different hosts. Plasmids often serve as mediators of lateral gene transfer, a process considered to be a strong and sculpting evolutionary force in microbial environments. Our aim was to characterize the overall plasmid population in the environment of the bovine rumen, which houses a complex and dense microbiota that holds enormous significance for humans. We developed a procedure for the isolation of total rumen plasmid DNA, termed rumen plasmidome, and subjected it to deep sequencing using the Illumina paired-end protocol and analysis using public and custom-made bioinformatics tools. A large number of plasmidome contigs aligned with plasmids of rumen bacteria isolated from different locations and at various time points, suggesting that not only the bacterial taxa, but also their plasmids, are defined by the ecological niche. The bacterial phylum distribution of the plasmidome was different from that of the rumen bacterial taxa. Nevertheless, both shared a dominance of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Evidently, the rumen plasmidome is of a highly mosaic nature that can cross phyla. Interestingly, when we compared the functional profile of the rumen plasmidome to two plasmid databases and two recently published rumen metagenomes, it became apparent that the rumen plasmidome codes for functions, which are enriched in the rumen ecological niche and could confer advantages to their hosts, suggesting that the functional profiles of mobile genetic elements are associated with their environment, as has been previously implied for viruses.</jats:p>",0

To elucidate the epidemiological relationships between ND outbreaks and genetic 
lineages, a portion of the F gene (535 bp) and the full-length HN gene (1922 bp) 
of recent Taiwanese NDVs isolated in 2002-2008 was amplified by reverse 
transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. Only a portion 
of above amplified PCR products of the F and HN genes (374 and 1713 bp) and 
their deduced amino acid residues were compared with the other 60 NDVs retrieved 
from GenBank. Most (29/30) of the recent Taiwanese isolates were clustered in 
subgenotype VIIe while only one isolate was classified as subgenotype VIIc. All 
the 29 isolates of subgenotype VIIe were further subclassified and termed 
provisionally as sub-subgenotypes VIIe2 (13 isolates), VIIe3 (5 isolates), and 
VIIe4 (11 isolates). The sub-subgenotype VIIe2 isolates possessing the motif 
(112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117) and amino acid residue substitutions at positions 23 (L to 
F) and 90 (T to A) were collected during 2002-2005. The sub-subgenotype VIIe3 
isolates possessing the motif (112)R-R-K-K-R-F(117) and amino acid residue 
substitutions at positions 74 (E to G) and 75 (A to G) within epitopes and 114 
(Q to K) within cleavage site of F protein were collected during 2003-2006. The 
sub-subgenotype VIIe4 isolates possessing the motif (112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117) and 
amino acid residue substitutions at positions 23 (L to F), 26 (I to T), and 90 
(T to A) were collected during 2007-2008. All the NDV isolates in this study 
exhibited a high intra-cerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), they were all 
classified as velogenic type of NDVs. The sub-subgenotype VIIe2 and VIIe4 
viruses are now dominant and have been implicated in most of the recent ND 
outbreaks in Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates revealed that they 
may have evolved from previously reported local strains (VIIe1). This finding is 
essential for improving the disease control strategies and development of 
vaccines for ND.

Genetic variability of porcine circovirus 2 in vaccinating and non-vaccinating commercial farms,"<jats:p>Vaccines against porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) are now widely used to control the diseases caused by the virus. Although the vaccines protect pigs against the disease, they do not lead to sterilizing immunity and therefore infections with PCV2 continue in farms. It is expected that, due to its high evolutionary rate, PCV2 can adapt quickly to environmental pressures such as vaccination. The goal of this study was to elucidate the molecular variation of PCV2 in relation to vaccination. PCV2 variability was investigated from samples of infected pigs from five farms where vaccination had never been applied and two farms where pigs had been vaccinated for at least 2 years. For the genetic analysis, full PCV2 genomes were amplified and subsequently pooled by vaccination status from serum of eight vaccinated, infected pigs and 16 non-vaccinated, infected pigs. Variability of viral populations was quantified using next-generation sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analysis. The number of segregating sites was similar in the non-vaccinated (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 109) and vaccinated pools (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 96), but the distribution of these sites in the genome differed. Most notably, in the capsid gene, the number of segregating sites was observed only in the non-vaccinated population. Based on the structural analysis, it is expected that some low-frequency amino acids result in biologically low-fit viruses. On the contrary, D294 in replicase represents a novel amino acid which was dominant and unique in the vaccinated pool. This work showed that variable PCV2 populations were circulating in commercial farms, and that this variability was different in samples obtained from vaccinating and non-vaccinating farms.</jats:p>",0

Emerging viral diseases represent an ongoing challenge for globalized world and 
bats constitute an immense, partially explored, reservoir of potentially 
zoonotic viruses. Caliciviruses are important human and animal pathogens and, as 
observed for human noroviruses, they may impact on human health on a global 
scale. By screening fecal samples of bats in Hungary, calicivirus RNA was 
identified in the samples of Myotis daubentonii and Eptesicus serotinus bats. In 
order to characterize more in detail the bat caliciviruses, large portions of 
the genome sequence of the viruses were determined. Phylogenetic analyses and 
molecular modeling identified firmly the two viruses as candidate members within 
the Caliciviridae family, with one calicivirus strain resembling members of the 
Sapovirus genus and the other bat calicivirus being more related to porcine 
caliciviruses of the proposed genus Valovirus. This data serves the effort for 
detecting reservoir hosts for potential emerging viruses and recognize important 
evolutionary relationships.

Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an important viral disease of sheep and 
goats, endemic in India. The study was undertaken to characterize the local PPRV 
by sequencing fusion (F) protein and nucleoprotein (N) gene segments and 
phylogenetic analysis, so as to focus on genetic variation in the field viruses. 
Selected regions of PPRV genome were amplified from clinical samples collected 
from 32 sheep and goats by RT-PCR and the resulting amplicons were sequenced for 
phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree based on the 322bp F gene sequences 
of PPRV from five different locations clustered them into lineage 4 along with 
other Asian isolates. While the 425bp N gene sequences revealed a different 
pattern of branching, yielding three distinct clusters for Nigerian, Turkey and 
Indian isolates. Thus, classification of PPRV into lineages based on the N gene 
sequences appeared to yield better picture of molecular epidemiology for PPRV.

            <jats:italic>Schmallenberg</jats:italic> virus (SBV) is the member of Peribunyaviridae family, which comprises pathogens of importance for human and veterinary medicine. The virus is transmitted only between animals and mainly by biting midges of the genus <jats:italic>Culicoides</jats:italic>. This study was performed in order to determine SBV genetic diversity and elucidate the host–vector adaptation. All three viral segments were analysed for sequence variability and phylogenetic relations. The Polish SBV strains obtained from acute infections of cattle, congenital cases in sheep, and from <jats:italic>Culicoides</jats:italic> midges were sequenced using Sanger and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. The obtained sequences were genetically similar (99.2–100% identity) to the first-detected strain BH80/11—4 from German cattle. The sampling year and origin of Polish sequences had no effect on molecular diversity of SBV. Considering all analysed Polish as well as European sequences, ovine-derived sequences were the most variable, while the midge ones were more conserved and encompassed unique substitutions located mainly in nonstructural protein S. SBV sequences isolated from <jats:italic>Culicoides</jats:italic> are the first submitted to GenBank and reported.</jats:p>",0

A novel virus, designated Cygnet River virus (CyRV), was isolated in embryonated 
eggs from Muscovy ducks in South Australia. CyRV morphologically resembles 
arenaviruses; however, sequencing identified CyRV as an orthomyxovirus. The high 
mortality rate among ducks co-infected with salmonellae suggests that CyRV may 
be pathogenic, either alone or in concert with other infections.

Kobuviruses are member of the family Picornaviridae. Initially, members in 
Kobuvirus genus were named according to the basis of their host species. The 
viruses found in humans called ""Aichi virus"", the viruses from cattle called 
""bovine kobuvirus"", and the viruses isolated from pigs called ""porcine 
kobuvirus"". Currently, taxonomy of kobuviruses has been proposed and the virus 
species have been renamed. The ""Aichi virus"" has been renamed as ""Aichivirus A"", 
""bovine kobuvirus"" has been renamed as ""Aichivirus B"", and ""porcine kobuvirus"" 
has been changed to ""Aichivirus C"". Among Aichivirus A, three distinct members, 
including Aichi virus 1 (Aichivirus in human), canine kobuvirus 1, and murine 
kobuvirus 1, have been described. Aichi virus 1 in human is globally distributed 
and has been identified at low incidence (0-3 %) in sporadic acute 
gastroenteritis cases. Aichi virus 1 has been reported to be associated with 
variety types of clinical illnesses including diarrhea, vomiting, fever, 
purulent conjunctivitis, and respiratory symptoms. The studies from Japan, 
Spain, Germany, and Tunisia demonstrated that high antibody prevalence against 
Aichi virus 1 were found in the populations. Aichivirus B or previously known as 
bovine kobuvirus was first reported in 2003. Since then, Aichivirus B has also 
been reported from several countries worldwide. An overall prevalence of 
Aichivirus B varies from 1 to 34.5 %, and the highest prevalence was found in 
cattle with diarrhea in Korea. Aichivirus C or porcine kobuvirus is widely 
distributed in pigs. Aichivirus C has been found in both diarrhea and healthy 
pigs and the positive rate of this virus varies from 3.9 up to 100 %. It was 
reported that Aichivirus C was found with high prevalence in wild boars in 
Hungary. The accumulated data of the biological, pathological, as well as 
epidemiological studies of kobuviruses are still limited. Comprehensive global 
investigations of the prevalence and diversity are required and will be helpful 
for providing further insight into pathogenicity, genetic heterogeneity, 
interspecies transmission, and global distribution of kobuviruses.

A Multicenter Study To Evaluate the Performance of High-Throughput Sequencing for Virus Detection,"<jats:p>Recent high-throughput sequencing (HTS) investigations have resulted in unexpected discoveries of known and novel viruses in a variety of sample types, including research materials, clinical materials, and biological products. Therefore, HTS can be a powerful tool for supplementing current methods for demonstrating the absence of adventitious or unwanted viruses in biological products, particularly when using a new cell line. However, HTS is a complex technology with different platforms, which needs standardization for evaluation of biologics. This collaborative study was undertaken to investigate detection of different virus types using two different HTS platforms. The results of the independently performed studies demonstrated a similar sensitivity of virus detection, regardless of the different sample preparation and processing procedures and bioinformatic analyses done in the three laboratories. Comparable HTS detection of different virus types supports future development of reference virus materials for standardization and validation of different HTS platforms.</jats:p>",0

Classical swine fever is a highly contagious and economically important viral 
disease of pigs. Outbreaks of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) were recorded 
in different places in the Kamrup district of Assam in India between the years 
2012 and 2014. The nucleotide sequences of the 10 CSFV isolates were analyzed 
based on the partial nucleotide sequences of the E2, 5'NTR and NS5B genes. 
Phylogenetic analysis indicated the dominance of subgroup 2.2 along with 2.1 
strains in the northeast part of India. Variation in the nucleotide sequences of 
E2, 5'NTR and 3'NS5B genes of CSFV allows tracking changes in the virus 
population over time. The study will provide epidemiological information useful 
for assessing CSFV circulating genogroups in India.

The continued spread and occurrence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has posed 
potential threat to domestic poultry industry around the globe. Mainly, wild 
avian species has always been implicated for the natural reservoir for virus and 
spread of the disease. In the present study, we report the isolation of 
Newcastle disease virus (NDV/Peacock/India/2012) in necropsy brain tissue sample 
of wild peacock from North India. Complete genome of the virus was found to be 
15,186 nucleotides (nts) with six genes in order of 3'-N-P-M-F-HN-L-5', which 
was limited by 55-nts leader region at the 3' end and a 114-nts trailer sequence 
at 5' end. Sequence analysis of fusion protein revealed the dibasic amino acid 
cleavage site (112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117), a characteristic motif of virulent virus. 
Phylogenetic analysis placed the isolate in genotype II of Newcastle disease 
virus showing the lowest mean percent divergence (6 %) with other genotype II 
counterparts. The isolate was characterized as mesogenic (intermediate 
pathotype) based on the mean death time (63 h) in embryonated chicken eggs and 
the intra-cerebral pathogenicity index (1.40) in day-old chicks. The report 
emphasizes the dynamic ecology of NDV strains circulating in a wild avian host 
during the outbreak of 2012 in North India. Further the genotypic and 
pathotypical characterizations of the isolate could help in development of 
homologous vaccine against NDV strain circulating in avian population.

Genetic variability in hepatitis B viruses,"<jats:p>In 1988, it was reported that the full nucleotide sequences of 18 hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains clustered into four genetic groups (A to D) with more than 8% divergence between the groups. This classification of strains in terms of genome sequence has since proven to be an important tool in the understanding of HBV epidemiology and evolution and has been expanded to include three more genotypes. In parallel with the HBV genotypes described in humans, HBV strains isolated from different primates and hepadnaviruses found in woodchucks, ground squirrels, ducks and herons have been studied. Sequence differences between HBV genotypes can lead to structural differences at the level of the pregenome and can also lead to dramatic differences at the translational level when specific and commonly occurring mutations occur. There is increasing evidence that the clinical picture, the response to treatment and the long-term prognosis may differ depending on which genotype has infected the patient. The consideration of traditional serological patterns in a patient must therefore take the genotype of the infecting strain into account. Nucleotide variability between HBV strains has been used in several studies to trace routes of transmission and, since it is becoming increasingly clear that the differences between HBV genotypes are important, the need for reliable and easy methods of differentiating HBV genotypes has arisen. This review summarizes the knowledge of HBV genotypes with regard to their genetic, structural and clinically significant differences and their origin and evolution in the context of the hepadnaviruses in general.</jats:p>",0
Predicting the global spread of H5N1 avian influenza,"<jats:p>The spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza into Asia, Europe, and Africa has resulted in enormous impacts on the poultry industry and presents an important threat to human health. The pathways by which the virus has and will spread between countries have been debated extensively, but have yet to be analyzed comprehensively and quantitatively. We integrated data on phylogenetic relationships of virus isolates, migratory bird movements, and trade in poultry and wild birds to determine the pathway for 52 individual introduction events into countries and predict future spread. We show that 9 of 21 of H5N1 introductions to countries in Asia were most likely through poultry, and 3 of 21 were most likely through migrating birds. In contrast, spread to most (20/23) countries in Europe was most likely through migratory birds. Spread in Africa was likely partly by poultry (2/8 introductions) and partly by migrating birds (3/8). Our analyses predict that H5N1 is more likely to be introduced into the Western Hemisphere through infected poultry and into the mainland United States by subsequent movement of migrating birds from neighboring countries, rather than from eastern Siberia. These results highlight the potential synergism between trade and wild animal movement in the emergence and pandemic spread of pathogens and demonstrate the value of predictive models for disease control.</jats:p>",0

Bat species around the world have recently been recognized as major reservoirs 
of several zoonotic viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 
Nipah virus and Hendra virus. In this study, consensus primer-based reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) and high-throughput 
sequencing were performed to investigate viruses in bat faecal samples collected 
at 11 natural bat habitat sites from July to December 2015 in Korea. Diverse 
coronaviruses were first detected in Korean bat faeces, including 
alphacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-like and MERS-CoV-like betacoronaviruses. In 
addition, we identified a novel bat rotavirus belonging to group H rotavirus 
which has only been described in human and pigs until now. Therefore, our 
results suggest the need for continuing surveillance and additional virological 
studies in domestic bat.

In South Korea, 32 sequences of chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV) from 
various flocks of breeder and commercial chickens were genetically characterized 
for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral protein 1 gene, including 
a hypervariable region of the CIAV genome, indicated that Korean CIAV strains 
were separated into groups II, IIIa, and IIIb. Strains were commonly identified 
in great-grandparent and grandparent breeder farms as well as commercial chicken 
farms. In the field, CIAV strains from breeder farms had no clinical effects, 
but commercial farm strains were associated with depression, growth retardation, 
and anemia regardless of the group from which the strain originated. In 
addition, we identified 7 CIAV genomes that were similar to vaccine strains from 
vaccinated and unvaccinated breeder flocks. These data suggest that further 
studies on pathogenicity and vaccine efficacy against the different CIAV group 
are needed, along with continuous CIAV surveillance and genetic analysis at 
breeder farms.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N8 subtype was isolated 
from a young ostrich in South Korea in March 2014. Clinical signs characterized 
by anorexia, depression, and signs of nervousness were observed. The isolated 
A/ostrich/Korea/H829/2014 (H5N8) virus had a cleavage site motif containing 
multiple basic amino acids, typical of HPAI virus. The phylogenetic tree of the 
hemagglutinin gene of the H5 HPAI virus showed that this ostrich H5N8 virus 
belongs to clade 2.3.4.4 viruses together with H5N8 strains isolated from ducks 
and wild birds in South Korea in 2014. Pathologically, redness of pancreas, 
enlargement and hemorrhage of spleen, friability of brain, and hydropericardium 
were prominently found. Histologic legions were observed in pancreas, spleen, 
liver, lung, heart, and brain, and influenza A nucleoproteins were detected in 
the same organs by immunohistochemistry. Other ostriches farmed together in open 
camps were not infected with HPAI virus based on the serologic and virologic 
tests. The findings indicate that ostriches are susceptible to H5N8 HPAI virus, 
but this virus does not spread efficiently among ratites.

Transmissible viral proventriculitis (TVP), an infectious disease in chickens, 
is responsible for economic losses in the commercial poultry industry. The major 
etiologic agent, however, is unknown. Using metagenomics, we compared the 
diversity of viruses present in proventriculus samples from flocks diagnosed 
with TVP to those of healthy flocks in South Korea between 2003 and 2012. Each 
sample had a mean of 21,538,726 sequence reads generated by high-throughput 
sequencing, with a mean length of 160 nt. Enrichment in viral sequences 
suggested that at least three viruses were present in each TVP sample. Although 
we could not determine a pathogen of TVP that matched the known morphology, 
picornavirus sequences were present in all five disease samples, suggesting an 
association with TVP. The five samples yielded 1,045-1,720 bp contigs with 81-84 
% nt sequence identity to turkey hepatitis virus (accession number: HM751199). 
Whole-genome analysis indicated that the QIA01 strain of the novel picornavirus 
was similar to turkey hepatitis virus in the P2 and P3 regions (82.7 % nt and 
95.5 % aa sequence identity), but different in the structural region and partial 
2A peptides (56.2 % nt and 23.9 % aa sequence identity). In addition, the QIA01 
virus was similar (87.0 % nt and 95.6 % aa sequence identity) to chicken 
megrivirus, recently detected in chickens with malabsorption syndrome in 
Hungary. Our results are useful for understanding the genetic diversity of avian 
picornaviruses and for classifying chicken megrivirus as a pathogen affecting 
the digestive tract of chickens.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a causative agent of chickenpox in primary 
infection and shingles after its reactivation from latency. Complete or 
almost-complete genomic DNA sequences for various VZV strains have been 
reported. Recently, clinical VZV strains were isolated from Korean patients 
whose genome was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology. In this 
study, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of VZV strains to 
genetically characterize Korean clinical isolates. Phylogenetic analyses 
revealed that three Korean strains, YC01, YC02, and YC03, were linked to clade 
2. Comprehensive SNP analysis identified 86 sites specific for the 5 VZV clades. 
VZV strains isolated from Korea did not form a phylogenetic cluster. Rather, 
YC02 and YC03 clustered strongly with Chinese strain 84-7 within clade 2, more 
specifically cluster 2a. Signature sequences for the cluster 2a were identified 
and found to play an important role in the separation of cluster 2a strains from 
other clade 2 strains, as shown in substitution studies. Further genetic 
analysis with additional strains isolated from Japan, China, and other Asian 
countries would provide a novel insight into the significance of two distinct 
subclades within clade 2.

Efficient Selection of Antibodies Reactive to Homologous Epitopes on Human and Mouse Hepatocyte Growth Factors by Next-Generation Sequencing-Based Analysis of the B Cell Repertoire,"<jats:p>YYB-101 is a humanized rabbit anti-human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-neutralizing antibody currently in clinical trial. To test the effect of HGF neutralization with antibody on anti-cancer T cell immunity, we generated surrogate antibodies that are reactive to the mouse homologue of the epitope targeted by YYB-101. First, we immunized a chicken with human HGF and monitored changes in the B cell repertoire by next-generation sequencing (NGS). We then extracted the VH gene repertoire from the NGS data, clustered it into components by sequence homology, and classified the components by the change in the number of unique VH sequences and the frequencies of the VH sequences within each component following immunization. Those changes should accompany the preferential proliferation and somatic hypermutation or gene conversion of B cells encoding HGF-reactive antibodies. One component showed significant increases in the number and frequencies of unique VH sequences and harbored genes encoding antibodies that were reactive to human HGF and competitive with YYB-101 for HGF binding. Some of the antibodies also reacted to mouse HGF. The selected VH sequences shared 98.3% identity and 98.9% amino acid similarity. It is therefore likely that the antibodies encoded by them all react to the epitope targeted by YYB-101.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD), caused by porcine 
circovirus type 2 (PCV2), threaten the pig industry worldwide. Five genotypes of 
PCV2 were recently identified: PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2c, PCV2d and PCV2e. In 
addition, a novel porcine circovirus from a case of a sow with dermatitis, 
nephropathy syndrome and reproductive failure has been identified based on 
metagenomic analysis and classified as porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3). 
Therefore, the current study was conducted to determine the prevalence and 
genetic characteristics of PCV2 and PCV3 in clinical samples.
RESULTS: A total of 471 samples (161 tissue samples of lungs and lymph nodes 
from 34 farms and 310 serum samples from 47 farms) were tested for PCV2. Among 
them, 171 samples from 59 farms that had been positive for PCV2 were genotyped. 
Another 690 samples (296 tissue samples of lungs and lymph nodes from 91 farms, 
108 samples of aborted foetuses from 26 farms, and 286 serum samples from 47 
farms) were tested for PCV3. Based on PCV2 genotyping results, PCV2d was the 
most prevalent genotype (107 of 171 samples), and co-infections with 
combinations of PCV2a, 2b and 2d were identified in 48 samples from 17 farms. A 
total of 14 samples from 11 farms were also positive for both PCV2 and PCV3. For 
PCV3, 57 samples (9.8%) from 32 farms (23.2%) were positive. Among the 108 
aborted foetuses from 26 farms, only 2 samples were positive for PCV3. Based on 
sequence comparisons, PCV2d shares 89.6-91.0% and 93.2-94.3% homology with PCV2a 
and PCV2b, respectively; 98.6-100% homology is shared among PCV2d strains. The 
PCV3 strains identified in this study share 98.0-99.5% homology.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study concludes that PCV2d has become the most predominant 
genotype in Korea. PCV3 was also identified in clinical samples, though no 
significant association with clinical symptoms was observed in PCV3-positive 
cases.

Complete Genome Sequence of a Novel Newcastle Disease Virus Strain Isolated from a Chicken in West Africa,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The complete genome sequence of an African Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain isolated from a chicken in Togo in 2009 was determined. The genome is 15,198 nucleotides (nt) in length and is classified in genotype VII in the class II cluster. Compared to common vaccine strains, the African strain contains a previously described 6-nt insert in the downstream untranslated region of the N gene and a novel 6-nt insert in the HN-L intergenic region. Genome length differences are a marker of the natural history of NDV. This is the first description of a class II NDV strain with a genome of 15,198 nt and a 6-nt insert in the HN-L intergenic region. Sequence divergence relative to vaccine strains was substantial, likely contributes to outbreaks, and illustrates the continued evolution of new NDV strains in West Africa.</jats:p>",0

To detect the circulation of H7 avian influenza viruses, we characterized H7 
viruses found in migratory birds and live poultry markets of South Korea from 
2005 to 2014. Phylogenic analysis revealed that while all viruses clustered into 
the Eurasian-lineage of H7 avian viruses, at least 12 distinct genotypes were 
represented. Most H7 viruses contained at least one gene segment from the 
highly-pathogenic A/Sck/Hong Kong/YU100/02(H5N1)-like avian virus, and they 
could be separated into at least two antigenic groups. Although we did not 
detect genetically identical strains, HI assay demonstrated close 
cross-reactivity of some isolates with the H7N9 viruses from China. Animal 
studies revealed that most of the genotypes could replicate in the lungs of mice 
and chickens without prior adaptation and some, particularly H7N4 and H7N7 
subtypes, induced mortality in mice. These results reinforce growing pandemic 
concerns regarding recent H7 viruses and emphasize the importance of continued 
surveillance of avian influenza viruses in the wild.

During the outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N6 viruses in 
2016 in South Korea, novel H5N8 viruses were also isolated from migratory birds. 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the HA gene of these H5N8 viruses belonged 
to clade 2.3.4.4, similarly to recent H5Nx viruses, and originated from 
A/Brk/Korea/Gochang1/14(H5N8), a minor lineage of H5N8 that appeared in 2014 and 
then disappeared. At least four reassortment events occurred with different 
subtypes (H5N8, H7N7, H3N8 and H10N7) and a chicken challenge study revealed 
that they were classified as HPAI viruses according to OIE criteria.

Due to the poor-fidelity of the enzymes involved in RNA genome replication, 
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus samples comprise of unique polymorphic 
populations. In this study, deep sequencing was utilised to characterise the 
diversity of FMD virus (FMDV) populations in 6 infected cattle present on a 
single farm during the series of outbreaks in the UK in 2007. A novel RT-PCR 
method was developed to amplify a 7.6kb nucleotide fragment encompassing the 
polyprotein coding region of the FMDV genome. Illumina sequencing of each sample 
identified the fine polymorphic structures at each nucleotide position, from 
consensus level changes to variants present at a 0.24% frequency. These data 
were used to investigate population dynamics of FMDV at both herd and host 
levels, evaluate the impact of host on the viral swarm structure and to identify 
transmission links with viruses recovered from other farms in the same series of 
outbreaks. In 7 samples, from 6 different animals, a total of 5 consensus level 
variants were identified, in addition to 104 sub-consensus variants of which 22 
were shared between 2 or more animals. Further analysis revealed differences in 
swarm structures from samples derived from the same animal suggesting the 
presence of distinct viral populations evolving independently at different 
lesion sites within the same infected animal.

VIDISCA is a next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation method 
designed to enrich viral nucleic acids from samples before highly-multiplexed 
low depth sequencing. Reliable detection of known viruses and discovery of novel 
divergent viruses from NGS data require dedicated analysis tools that are both 
sensitive and accurate. Existing software was utilised to design a new 
bioinformatic workflow for high-throughput detection and discovery of viruses 
from VIDISCA data. The workflow leverages the VIDISCA library preparation 
molecular biology, specifically the use of Mse1 restriction enzyme which 
produces biological replicate library inserts from identical genomes. The 
workflow performs total metagenomic analysis for classification of non-viral 
sequence including parasites and host, and separately carries out virus specific 
analyses. Ribosomal RNA sequence is removed to increase downstream analysis 
speed and remaining reads are clustered at 100% identity. Known and novel 
viruses are sensitively detected via alignment to a virus-only protein database, 
and false positives are removed. A new cluster-profiling analysis takes 
advantage of the viral biological replicates produced by Mse1 digestion, using 
read clustering to flag the presence of short genomes at very high copy number. 
Importantly, this analysis ensures that highly repeated sequences are identified 
even if no homology is detected, as is shown here with the detection of a novel 
gokushovirus genome from human faecal matter. The workflow was validated using 
read data derived from serum and faeces samples taken from HIV-1 positive 
adults, and serum samples from pigs that were infected with atypical porcine 
pestivirus.

BACKGROUND: Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the major 
pathogens involved in the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex. The 
seroprevalence to BRSV in Norwegian cattle herds is high, but its role in 
epidemics of respiratory disease is unclear. The aims of the study were to 
investigate the etiological role of BRSV and other respiratory viruses in 
epidemics of BRD and to perform phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian BRSV strains.
RESULTS: BRSV infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically 
in 18 (86%) of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent. When 
serology indicated that bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3 
were present, the number of BRSV positive animals in the herd was always higher, 
supporting the view of BRSV as the main pathogen. Sequencing of the G gene of 
BRSV positive samples showed that the current circulating Norwegian BRSVs belong 
to genetic subgroup II, along with other North European isolates. One isolate 
from an outbreak in Norway in 1976 was also investigated. This strain formed a 
separate branch in subgroup II, clearly different from the current Scandinavian 
sequences. The currently circulating BRSV could be divided into two different 
strains that were present in the same geographical area at the same time. The 
sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenic important part 
of the G protein.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that BRSV is the most important etiological 
agent of epidemics of BRD in Norway and that it often acts as the only viral 
agent. The phylogenetic analysis of the Norwegian strains of BRSV and several 
previously published isolates supported the theory of geographical and temporal 
clustering of BRSV.

Prevention of cross-species infection with porcine endogenous retroviruses 
(PERV) is crucial for xenotransplantation. Previous studies described the 
potential risk of infection for the PERV gamma1 subfamilies A, B and C. 
Replication competent PERV gamma1 proviruses designated to a particular 
subfamily and hybrid viruses originating from retroviral recombination events 
between the subfamilies were observed. Future pig genome sequencing projects 
will reveal multiple novel PERV proviruses from additional breeds and animals. 
Evaluation of these viral genomes has to be carried out to assess the potential 
risk of retroviral cross-species infection. In this study, we tested common 
sequence comparison methods for the classification of PERV sequences and the 
detection of hybrid clones. The examination of the polymorphic nucleotide 
positions was found to be the most suitable procedure. We describe a fast and 
simple method using bioinformatic software tools which can also be applied to 
analogous analyses of other viral genomes.

Public health impact of the Enteroviruses and Parechoviruses,"<jats:p>Enteroviruses (EV) comprise viruses originally classified on cell culture replication patterns and clinical manifestations into a number of groups: poliovirus, coxsackievirus A, coxsackievirus B and ECHOvirus. The closely related genus Parechovirus has more recently been associated with human disease. EVs are common commensals of the human gut, often found without any ill effects on the person, but are also associated with a wide range of diseases and syndromes including non-specific rash illnesses, hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), conjunctivitis, meningitis and encephalitis, myocarditis and polio. This results in a significant burden of disease worldwide, often due to a particular genotype of EV. An estimated 1 billion people are infected with EV every year.</jats:p>",0

A serological classification of bovine enteroviruses.

Knowles NJ, Barnett IT.

Cross virus neutralization (VN), complement fixation (CF) and 
immunoprecipitation (IP) tests were employed to compare the seven currently 
recognized bovine enterovirus (BEV) serotypes with seven serologically distinct 
strains previously isolated in Great Britain and two other BEV from the United 
Kingdom. Based on criteria used to differentiate other human and animal 
picornavirus serotypes, it was discovered that BEV types 1, 4, 5 and 6 were 
related to each other and could be included in a single serotype. Types 3 and 7 
were found to be identical, and related to serotype 2. All of the other nine BEV 
were included in either serotype 1 or 2. Not all of the strains in each serotype 
were identical and antigenic variants were designated as subtypes. Antigenic 
relationships not revealed by VN were demonstrated in CF and IP tests. Bovine 
enterovirus strains whose antisera had the broadest intratypic reactivity were 
suggested as prototypes. The two proposed BEV serotypes could also be 
distinguished by their ability to agglutinate erythrocytes. Guinea pig 
erythrocytes were agglutinates by both serotypes while sheep red cells only 
reacted with serotype 1.

Classification of porcine enteroviruses by antigenic analysis and cytopathic 
effects in tissue culture: description of 3 new serotypes.

Knowles NJ, Buckley LS, Pereira HG.

Porcine enteroviruses isolated in the United Kingdom between 1972 and 1976 were 
compared with the 8 serotypes previously described and with human coxsackie B 
virus types 1 to 6 for ability to grow in different cell lines. This allowed the 
classification of all strains into 3 broad groups according to type of 
cytopathic effect in IBRS-2 cells and further subdivision on the basis of 
production of cytopathic effect in BHK 21, HeLa and VERO cells. None of the 
porcine enterovirus strains was neutralized by antisera to human enteroviruses 
(Lim Benyesh-Melnick Pools) with the exception of swine vesicular disease virus, 
which was neutralised by coxsackie B5 antiserum. Antisera prepared either in 
gnotobiotic pigs or in guinea pigs against the 8 porcine enterovirus serotypes 
failed to neutralize 9 isolates which could be classified into 3 new serotypes, 
for which Nos. 9, 10 and 11 are proposed. Guinea pig sera could be used as an 
alternative to gnotobiotic pig sera for type differentiation.

Knowles NJ, Hedger RS.

Twenty-nine foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) type A virus strains, previously 
classified serologically as distinct subtypes were analysed by polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to determine the extent of variation in the pattern 
of the structural polypeptides and to evaluate the technique as an aid to 
existing subtyping techniques. The majority of the subtypes examined had 
distinct polypeptide patterns, however, some variation also occurred between 
strains within a subtype. The position of VP2(1B) and VP3(1C) was often 
unchanged in different strains within a subtype and between geographically 
related subtypes over long periods of time. Changes in the position of VP1(1D) 
were also observed within a subtype. The technique was considered to be of value 
for the screening of isolates prior to conventional serological subtyping 
procedures and in the tracing of the possible origin of FMD outbreaks.

Nucleotide sequences of field strains of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) 
contribute to our understanding of the distribution and evolution of viral 
lineages that circulate in different regions of the world. This paper outlines a 
practical reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing 
strategy that can be used to generate RNA sequences encoding the VP1 (1D) region 
of FMDV. The protocol contains a panel of PCR and sequencing primers that can be 
selected to characterise genetically diverse isolates representing all seven 
FMDV serotypes. A list of sequences is also described, comprising prototype 
sequences for all proposed FMDV topotypes, in order to provide a framework for 
phylogenetic analysis. The technical details and prototype sequences provided in 
this paper can be employed by FMD Reference Laboratories and others in an 
approach to harmonise the molecular epidemiology of FMDV.

"Genetic clustering of Borna disease virus natural animal isolates, laboratory and vaccine strains strongly reflects their regional geographical origin","<jats:p>The aim of this study was to gain more detailed insights into the genetic evolution and variability of Borna disease virus (BDV). Phylogenetic analyses were performed on field viruses originating from naturally infected animals, the BDV vaccine strain ‘Dessau’, four widely used laboratory strains and the novel BDV subtype No/98. Four regions of the BDV genome were analysed: the complete p40, p10 and p24 genes and the 5′-untranslated region of the X/P transcript. BDV isolates from the same geographical area exhibited a clearly higher degree of identity to each other than to BDV isolates from other regions, independent of host species and year of isolation. Five different clusters could be established within endemic areas, corresponding to the geographical regions from which the viruses originated: (i) a Swiss, Austrian and Liechtenstein Rhine valley group, related closely to the geographically bordering Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria II group (ii) in the western part of Germany; (iii) a third group, called Bavaria I group, limited in occurrence to Bavaria; (iv) a southern Saxony-Anhalt and bordering northern Saxony group, bound to the territories of these federal states in the eastern part of Germany; and (v) a mixed group, consisting of samples from different areas of Germany; however, these were mainly from the federal states of Thuringia and Lower Saxony. The laboratory strains and the vaccine strain clustered within these groups according to their geographical origins. All field and laboratory strains, as well as the vaccine strain, clearly segregated from the recently described and highly divergent BDV strain No/98, which originated from an area in Austria where Borna disease is not endemic.</jats:p>",0

The detection of West Nile virus (WNV) nucleic acid in a blood donation from 
Vienna, Austria, as well as in Culex pipiens pupae and egg rafts, sampled close 
to the donor's residence, is reported. Complete genomic sequences of the human- 
and mosquito-derived viruses were established, genetically compared and 
phylogenetically analyzed. The viruses were not identical, but closely related 
to each other and to recent Czech and Italian isolates, indicating 
co-circulation of related WNV strains within a confined geographic area. The 
detection of WNV in a blood donation originating from an area with low WNV 
prevalence in humans (only three serologically diagnosed cases between 2008 and 
2014) is surprising and emphasizes the importance of WNV nucleic acid testing of 
blood donations even in such areas, along with active mosquito surveillance 
programs.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of Herpesviridae, subfamily 
alpha-Herpesvirinae, is pathogenic exclusively in the human. Chickenpox is the 
result of primary infection of VZV. During the viremic stage, VZV infects 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and spreads to the periphery. In skin 
cells it causes typical lesions. Apoptosis has been demonstrated in different 
cell types by other alpha-herpesviruses. VZV-infected T lymphocytes, B 
lymphocytes, and monocytes, respectively, were examined in this in vitro study 
by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. All infected cell 
types showed signs of apoptosis: a lower DNA content, DNA fragmentation, loss of 
membrane integrity, and an altered nuclear morphology. The results observed led 
to the suggestion that VZV can induce apoptosis during infection in vivo in the 
PBMC subpopulations.

We have analysed complete or partial VPI sequences of 31 foot-and-mouth disease 
(FMD) viruses belonging to serotypes A, O and C to determine the genetic 
relatedness of field strains of FMD virus (FMDV) that have circulated in 
Argentina between 1961 and 1994. Phylogenetic analysis, which also included 15 
previously published Argentinean sequences and six reference strains, revealed 
that (i) FMD type A strains showed the highest genetic heterogeneity and could 
be divided into five lineages with a sequence divergence of 0.9-18.5% between 
strains (ii) most of the FMD type O viruses grouped in two clusters (within 
cluster sequence divergence ranging from 0.2% to 6.0%) circulating in Argentina 
since the early 1960s, and (iii) FMD type C viruses were grouped in two clusters 
with a 13.4% nucleotide sequence divergence between each cluster. The 
availability of sequence data for many more field isolates from the region will 
enable us to understand the genetic relationships between FMDV strains and to 
rapidly trace the source of an FMD outbreak for epidemiological surveillance.

During 2000-2002 a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epizootic affected Argentina and 
spread across the country resulting in more than 2500 outbreaks. In order to 
study the evolution of the FMD viruses (FMDV) and help with disease control 
measures, a genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis was performed of 
43 field isolates representative of the epizootic. The nucleotide sequence of 
the VP1-coding region was determined for the viruses and used in this study. Two 
serotype A lineages, A/Arg/00 and A/Arg/01 (1000/1000 bootstrap value) and two 
different serotype O/Arg/00 lineages (848/1000 bootstrap value) were identified. 
Phylogenetic analysis showed that viruses A/Arg/01 and O/Arg/00 could be related 
with former South American isolates, while the origin of A Argentina 2000 
viruses remains unclear. Comparison of the amino acid sequences with vaccine 
reference strains revealed differences at critical antigenic sites for emergent 
strains A/Arg/00 and A/Arg/01, leading to a change in the current vaccine 
formulation.

Gene segments from avian H1N1 influenza A viruses have reassorted with other 
influenza viruses to generate pandemic strains over the past century. 
Nevertheless, little effort has been invested in understanding the 
characteristics of avian H1N1 influenza viruses. Here, we present the genome 
sequence and a molecular and virological characterization of an avian influenza 
A virus, A/wild bird/Korea/SK14/2014 (A/SK14, H1N1), isolated from migratory 
birds in South Korea during the winter season of 2014-2015. Full-genome 
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus belongs to the 
Eurasian avian lineage. Although it retained avian-receptor binding preference, 
A/SK14 virus also exhibited detectable human-like receptor binding and was able 
to replicate in differentiated primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. 
In animal models, A/SK14 virus was moderately pathogenic in mice, and virus was 
detected in nasal washes from inoculated guinea pigs, but not in direct-contact 
guinea pigs. Although A/SK14 showed moderate pathogenicity and no evidence of 
transmission in a mammalian model, our results suggest that the dual receptor 
specificity of A/SK14-like virus might allow for a more rapid adaptation to 
mammals, emphasizing the importance of further continuous surveillance and 
risk-assessment activities.

Two panels of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the classical swine fever 
virus (CSFV) envelope glycoproteins E2 (12 mAbs) and E0 (11 mAbs) were 
established and tested by immunoperoxidase binding assay against 135 pestivirus 
strains and isolates. Variability of the binding pattern was demonstrated for 
CSFV and also for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strains and isolates. The 
panels of mAbs against E2 and E0 led to very different reactivity patterns. 
Particular mAbs against E2 reacted with (i) all CSFV isolates, (ii) only 4 out 
of 126 CSFV isolates, or (iii) about 90% of the tested CSFV isolates and 78% of 
ruminant pestivirus isolates. Anti CSFV E0 mAbs allowed the detection of a 
greater variability among the CSFV strains and isolates than the anti E2 mAbs. 
None of the 11 anti E0 mAbs recognized an epitope conserved for CSFV or showed 
crossreactivity with ruminant pestiviruses. The use of both panels of mAbs 
against two CSFV structural glycoproteins led to the discrimination of 21 
antigenic types of CSFV strains and isolates. The described panels can be used 
to trace the origin of CSFV after outbreaks of the disease.

Thirteen orf virus isolates obtained during the time period between 1995 and 
2004 from crusted scab lesions of nine sheep and four goats from different 
geographical areas of Greece and Italy with suspected contagious ecthyma 
infection were analyzed. DNA of all isolates was successfully amplified by PCR 
with the primers 045F-045R and identified them as parapox virus. Partial DNA 
sequence of orf virus interferon resistant (VIR) gene, phylogenetic analysis of 
the available isolates and amino acid comparison of the interferon resistance 
protein encoded by this genomic region was carried out. According to the results 
of the present report a precise characterisation of the genomic region studied 
might provide evidence for the genetic variation and movement of the circulating 
orf virus strains.

The presence of chicken anemia virus (CAV) in Slovenia was confirmed by 
inoculation of 1-day-old chickens without antibodies against CAV and isolation 
of the virus on the Marek's disease chicken cell-MSB1 line and by polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR). Experimental inoculation of 1-day-old chickens resulted in 
lower hematocrit values, atrophy of the thymus, and atrophy of bone marrow. CAV 
was confirmed by PCR in the thymus, bone marrow, bursa of Fabricius, liver, 
spleen, ileocecal tonsils, duodenum, and proventriculus. The nucleotide sequence 
of the whole viral protein (VP)1 gene was determined by direct sequencing. 
Alignment of VP1 nucleotide sequences of Slovenian CAV isolates (CAV-69/00, 
CAV-469/01, and CAV-130/03) showed 99.4% to 99.9% homology. The VP1 nucleotide 
sequence alignment of Slovenian isolates with 19 other CAV strains demonstrated 
94.4% to 99.4% homology. Slovenian isolates shared highest homology with the 
BD-3 isolate from Bangladesh. Alignment of the deduced VP1 amino acids showed 
that the Slovenian isolates shared 100% homology and had an amino acid sequence 
most similar to the BD-3 strain from Bangladesh (99.6%) and were 99.1% similar 
to the G6 strain from Japan and the L-028 strain from the United States. The 
Slovenian isolates were least similar (96.6%) to the 82-2 strain from Japan. A 
phylogeneric analysis on the basis of the alignment of the VP1 amino acids 
showed that CAV isolates used in the study formed three groups that indicated 
the possible existence of genetic groups among CAV strains. The CAV isolates 
were grouped together independent of their geographic origin and pathogenicity.

Fourteen infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) detected in broiler, broiler 
breeder, and layer flocks in Slovenia between 2007 and 2009 were molecularly 
analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and direct sequencing of the S1 gene. 
Phylogenetic analyses based on partial S1 gene sequences revealed that seven 
strains were classified as the Italy 02 genotype, a genetic group of IBV that 
has not previously been detected in Slovenia. Another seven strains were 
classified as the QX genotype. The results of phylogenetic analyses and 
epidemiologic investigations revealed that the genetic classification correlates 
with the geographic origins of the IBV strains. Greater genetic variability 
(maximum nucleotide and amino acid divergences were 4.8% and 9.9%, respectively) 
was observed within the Slovenian strains from the Italy 02 genotype detected 
between 2007 and 2009 than within strains from the QX genotype isolated in 2008 
and 2009 (1.2% and 1.3%, respectively). The Slovenian strains classified as the 
Italy 02 genotype form a separate genetic cluster. These strains shared five 
specific amino acid substitutions that became fixed during the period of 
surveillance. Strains from the QX genotype that shared one specific amino acid 
substitution also form a separate genetic cluster.

Deep Sequencing Analysis Reveals Temporal Microbiota Changes Associated with Development of Bovine Digital Dermatitis,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bovine digital dermatitis (DD) is a leading cause of lameness in dairy cattle throughout the world. Despite 35 years of research, the definitive etiologic agent associated with the disease process is still unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple bacterial species are associated with lesions, with spirochetes being the most reliably identified organism. This study details the deep sequencing-based metagenomic evaluation of 48 staged DD biopsy specimens collected during a 3-year longitudinal study of disease progression. Over 175 million sequences were evaluated by utilizing both shotgun and 16S metagenomic techniques. Based on the shotgun sequencing results, there was no evidence of a fungal or DNA viral etiology. The bacterial microbiota of biopsy specimens progresses through a systematic series of changes that correlate with the novel morphological lesion scoring system developed as part of this project. This scoring system was validated, as the microbiota of each stage was statistically significantly different from those of other stages (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.001). The microbiota of control biopsy specimens were the most diverse and became less diverse as lesions developed. Although
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Treponema</jats:named-content>
            spp. predominated in the advanced lesions, they were in relatively low abundance in the newly described early lesions that are associated with the initiation of the disease process. The consortium of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Treponema</jats:named-content>
            spp. identified at the onset of disease changes considerably as the lesions progress through the morphological stages identified. The results of this study support the hypothesis that DD is a polybacterial disease process and provide unique insights into the temporal changes in bacterial populations throughout lesion development.

In this study we report the sequence and phylogenetic characterization of an 
orthoreovirus strain, CH1197/96, isolated from a spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo 
graeca) on chicken embryo fibroblast cells. The 23,957 bp long genome sequence 
was obtained by combined use of semiconductor and capillary sequencing. Although 
the genomic characterization showed that the virus was most similar to the bush 
viper reovirus strain, 47/02, and in phylogenies performed with all segments the 
two strains formed a monophyletic group, the nucleotide (48.4-70.3%) and amino 
acid (39.2-80.7%) sequence identity values were moderate between the two reptile 
origin reoviruses. Based on our results and existing classification criteria for 
the genus Orthoreovirus, the tortoise reovirus strain CH1197/96 might be the 
first representative of a novel reptilian origin Orthoreovirus species.

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) organizes the 
classification of viruses into taxa, but is not responsible for the nomenclature 
for taxa members. International experts groups, such as the ICTV Study Groups, 
recommend the classification and naming of viruses and their strains, variants, 
and isolates. The ICTV Filoviridae Study Group has recently introduced an 
updated classification and nomenclature for filoviruses. Subsequently, and 
together with numerous other filovirus experts, a consistent nomenclature for 
their natural genetic variants and isolates was developed that aims at 
simplifying the retrieval of sequence data from electronic databases. This is a 
first important step toward a viral genome annotation standard as sought by the 
US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Here, this work is 
extended to include filoviruses obtained in the laboratory by artificial 
selection through passage in laboratory hosts. The previously developed template 
for natural filovirus genetic variant naming (<virus name> <isolation 
host-suffix>/<country of sampling>/<year of sampling>/<genetic variant 
designation>-<isolate designation>) is retained, but it is proposed to adapt the 
type of information added to each field for laboratory animal-adapted variants. 
For instance, the full-length designation of an Ebola virus Mayinga variant 
adapted at the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology “Vector” to 
cause disease in guinea pigs after seven passages would be akin to “Ebola virus 
VECTOR/C.porcellus-lab/COD/1976/Mayinga-GPA-P7”. As was proposed for the names 
of natural filovirus variants, we suggest using the full-length designation in 
databases, as well as in the method section of publications. Shortened 
designations (such as “EBOV VECTOR/C.por/COD/76/May-GPA-P7”) and abbreviations 
(such as “EBOV/May-GPA-P7”) could be used in the remainder of the text depending 
on how critical it is to convey information contained in the full-length name. 
“EBOV” would suffice if only one EBOV strain/variant/isolate is addressed.

Nyamanini virus (NYMV) and Midway virus (MIDWV) are unclassified tick-borne 
agents that infect land birds and seabirds, respectively. The recent molecular 
characterization of both viruses confirmed their already known close serological 
relationship and revealed them to be nonsegmented, single- and negative-stranded 
RNA viruses that are clearly related to, but quite distinct from, members of the 
order Mononegavirales (bornaviruses, filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and 
rhabdoviruses). A third agent, soybean cyst nematode virus 1 (SbCNV-1, 
previously named soybean cyst nematode nyavirus), was recently found to be an 
additional member of this new virus group. Here, we review the current knowledge 
about all three viruses and propose classifying them as members of a new 
mononegaviral family, Nyamiviridae.

Knowledge of bornaviruses has expanded considerably during the last decade. A 
possible reservoir of mammalian Borna disease virus has been identified, 
divergent bornaviruses have been detected in birds and reptiles, and endogenous 
bornavirus-like elements have been discovered in the genomes of vertebrates of 
several species. Previous sequence comparisons and alignments have indicated 
that the members of the current family Bornaviridae are phylogenetically diverse 
and are not adequately classified in the existing bornavirus taxonomy supported 
by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). We provide an 
update of these analyses and describe their implications for taxonomy. We 
propose retaining the family name Bornaviridae and the genus Bornavirus but 
reorganizing species classification. PAirwise Sequence Comparison (PASC) of 
bornavirus genomes and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) comparison of 
genomic and protein sequences, in combination with other already published 
phylogenetic analyses and known biological characteristics of bornaviruses, 
indicate that this genus should include at least five species: Mammalian 1 
bornavirus (classical Borna disease virus and divergent Borna disease virus 
isolate No/98), Psittaciform 1 bornavirus (avian/psittacine bornaviruses 1, 2, 
3, 4, 7), Passeriform 1 bornavirus (avian/canary bornaviruses C1, C2, C3, LS), 
Passeriform 2 bornavirus (estrildid finch bornavirus EF), and Waterbird 1 
bornavirus (avian bornavirus 062CG). This classification is also in line with 
biological characteristics of these viruses and their vertebrate hosts. A snake 
bornavirus, proposed to be named Loveridge's garter snake virus 1, should be 
classified as a member of an additional species (Elapid 1 bornavirus), 
unassigned to a genus, in the family Bornaviridae. Avian bornaviruses 5, 6, 
MALL, and another ""reptile bornavirus"" (""Gaboon viper virus"") should stay 
unclassified until further information becomes available. Finally, we propose 
new virus names and abbreviations when necessary to achieve clear 
differentiation and unique identification.

The family Arteriviridae presently includes a single genus Arterivirus. This 
genus includes four species as the taxonomic homes for equine arteritis virus 
(EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), porcine respiratory and 
reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), 
respectively. A revision of this classification is urgently needed to 
accommodate the recent description of eleven highly divergent simian 
arteriviruses in diverse African nonhuman primates, one novel arterivirus in an 
African forest giant pouched rat, and a novel arterivirus in common brushtails 
in New Zealand. In addition, the current arterivirus nomenclature is not in 
accordance with the most recent version of the International Code of Virus 
Classification and Nomenclature. Here we outline an updated, amended, and 
improved arterivirus taxonomy based on current data. Taxon-specific sequence 
cut-offs are established relying on a newly established open reading frame 1b 
phylogeny and pairwise sequence comparison (PASC) of coding-complete arterivirus 
genomes. As a result, the current genus Arterivirus is replaced by five genera: 
Equartevirus (for EAV), Rodartevirus (LDV + PRRSV), Simartevirus (SHFV + simian 
arteriviruses), Nesartevirus (for the arterivirus from forest giant pouched 
rats), and Dipartevirus (common brushtail arterivirus). The current species 
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is divided into two species 
to accommodate the clear divergence of the European and American ""types"" of 
PRRSV, both of which now receive virus status. The current species Simian 
hemorrhagic fever virus is divided into nine species to accommodate the twelve 
known simian arteriviruses. Non-Latinized binomial species names are introduced 
to replace all current species names to clearly differentiate them from virus 
names, which remain largely unchanged.

Genomic Characterization of the Genus Nairovirus (Family Bunyaviridae),"<jats:p>Nairovirus, one of five bunyaviral genera, includes seven species. Genomic sequence information is limited for members of the Dera Ghazi Khan, Hughes, Qalyub, Sakhalin, and Thiafora nairovirus species. We used next-generation sequencing and historical virus-culture samples to determine 14 complete and nine coding-complete nairoviral genome sequences to further characterize these species. Previously unsequenced viruses include Abu Mina, Clo Mor, Great Saltee, Hughes, Raza, Sakhalin, Soldado, and Tillamook viruses. In addition, we present genomic sequence information on additional isolates of previously sequenced Avalon, Dugbe, Sapphire II, and Zirqa viruses. Finally, we identify Tunis virus, previously thought to be a phlebovirus, as an isolate of Abu Hammad virus. Phylogenetic analyses indicate the need for reassignment of Sapphire II virus to Dera Ghazi Khan nairovirus and reassignment of Hazara, Tofla, and Nairobi sheep disease viruses to novel species. We also propose new species for the Kasokero group (Kasokero, Leopards Hill, Yogue viruses), the Ketarah group (Gossas, Issyk-kul, Keterah/soft tick viruses) and the Burana group (Wēnzhōu tick virus, Huángpí tick virus 1, Tǎchéng tick virus 1). Our analyses emphasize the sister relationship of nairoviruses and arenaviruses, and indicate that several nairo-like viruses (Shāyáng spider virus 1, Xīnzhōu spider virus, Sānxiá water strider virus 1, South Bay virus, Wǔhàn millipede virus 2) require establishment of novel genera in a larger nairovirus-arenavirus supergroup.</jats:p>",0
Natural Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus Infection: Novel Pathologic Findings Resembling Other Morbillivirus Infections,"<jats:p> The present study describes pathologic and virologic findings in 15 sheep and 6 goats that died of natural peste des petits ruminants virus infection in Turkey. Pathologic findings included erosiveulcerative stomatitis, fibrino-necrotic tracheitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, multifocal coagulation necroses in the liver, and severe lymphocytolysis in lymphoid tissues. Syncytial cells were conspicuous, especially in the oral mucosa, pulmonary alveoli, liver, and lymphoid tissues. In addition to the typical tissue distribution, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic and/or intranuclear inclusions were observed in epithelial cells lining the renal pelvis and abomasal mucosa. Immunolabeling of the viral antigen was observed in the kidney, brain, rumen, abomasum, heart, and myocytes of the tongue besides its more typical locations. In this study, we report and describe in detail the first peste des petits ruminants endemic in Kirikkale Province, Central Anatolia of Turkey. In conclusion, these previously unreported pathologic findings in natural peste des petits ruminants virus infection establish a basis for resemblance to other morbillivirus infections, such as canine distemper and distemper of sea mammals. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that the 448-bp genome fragment was amplified in 18 cases (18/21, 85.7%). Phylogenetic analysis showed that viruses belong to lineage 4 in the peste des petits ruminants virus common phylogenetic tree. </jats:p>",0

The recent reports of human infection due to H6 subtype avian influenza viruses 
(AIV), which are prevalent in terrestrial poultry, indicate evolution of the 
virus to a possible pandemic strain. Here, we report antigenic and genetic 
characterization of two H6N2 viruses isolated from apparently healthy domestic 
ducks in Kerala and Assam, India during 2014 and 2015, respectively. 
Hemagglutination inhibition assay revealed antigenic divergence between the two 
isolates, which was corroborated by amino acid differences at 55 positions 
(15.98%) between their hemagglutinin (HA) 1.The sequence analyses indicated that 
both the viruses are avian origin with avian receptor specificity, low 
pathogenic to poultry and sensitive to oseltamivir. However, Kerala14 had V27I 
mutation marker for amantadine resistance in M2. The Assam15 virus had an 
additional N-linked glycosylation on HA2 (position 557) compared to Kerala14 
virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that both the viruses 
belonged to distinct lineages (Eurasian and Asia II). Phylogeny of neuraminidase 
and internal gene segments revealed that both the viruses are novel reassortants 
and are genetically distinct with different gene constellations. The results 
suggest independent introductions of the two H6N2 viruses into India and 
migratory wild birds in the Central Asian flyway might be the source of H6N2 
viruses in ducks in India. Therefore, continued AIV surveillance in poultry and 
wild birds is essential for early detection of emergence of novel strains with 
pandemic potential and control of their spread.

Orf (contagious ecthyma) is an exanthematic disease caused by a parapoxvirus and 
occurs primarily in sheep and goats with zoonotic implications. In the present 
investigation, an orf outbreak in the Muzzaffarnagari sheep flock at the Central 
Institute for Research on Goats (CIRG), Makhdoom, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India, 
was investigated. Primary goat testes cell culture was used for isolation of the 
orf virus (ORFV) for the first time. The identity of the virus was confirmed by 
amplification and sequence analysis of the major envelope glycoprotein (B2L) 
gene and named ORFV/sheep/India/2012/CIRG. On phylogenetic analysis of B2L 
protein gene, it clustered with the ORFV strains from China suggesting distinct 
ORFV strains are circulating in India. On comparison of nucleotide and deduced 
amino acid sequence analysis (n = 63), a unique 126S residue was observed in 
ORFV/sheep/India/2012/CIRG. On further sequence analysis (B2L) of different ORFV 
strains (n = 63), some conserved amino acid residues were identified as 
host-specific (sheep, human, camel, takin, and musk ox) and have been 
summarized.

Hepatitis E infection, caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), is a common cause 
of acute hepatitis in developing countries with poor sanitation and hygiene. The 
virus is classified into four genotypes (1-4) with one serotype. Genotypes 1 and 
2 exclusively infect humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 also infect other 
animals, particularly pigs. In endemic areas, large outbreaks of acute hepatitis 
caused by viruses of genotype 1 or 2 frequently occur due to fecal-oral 
transmission, usually through contamination of drinking water. With a high 
attack rate in young adults (aged 15-45 years), the disease is particularly 
severe among pregnant women (20-30% mortality). HEV appears to be a zoonotic 
disease, with transmission from pigs, wild boars, and deer, or foodborne. 
Chronic infections are rare, except in immunosuppressed persons, such as organ 
transplant recipients. A subunit vaccine has been shown to be effective in 
preventing the clinical disease, but is not yet commercially available. Our 
understanding of HEV has undergone major changes in recent years and in this 
article we review the currently available information with regard to the 
molecular biology, pathobiology, and epidemiology of HEV infection. We also 
review the current therapeutic interventions and strategies being used to 
control HEV infection, with emphasis on possible approaches that could be used 
to develop an effective vaccine against HEV.

Many members of the genus Flavivirus are the agents of important diseases of 
humans, livestock, and wildlife. Currently, no complete genome sequence is 
available for the three African viruses, Bagaza, Zika, and Kedougou viruses, 
each representing a distinct virus subgroup according to the latest virus 
classification. In this study, we obtained a complete genome sequence of each of 
those three viruses and characterized the open reading frames (ORFs) with 
respect to gene sizes, cleavage sites, potential glycosylation sites, 
distribution of cysteine residues, and unique motifs. The sequences of the three 
viruses were then scanned across the entire length of the ORF against available 
sequences of other African flaviviruses and selected reference viruses for 
genetic relatedness. The data collectively indicated that Kedougou virus was 
close to dengue viruses but nonetheless distinct, while Bagaza virus shared 
genetic relatedness with West Nile virus in several genomic regions. In the 
non-coding regions, it was found that a particular organizational pattern of 
conserved sequences in the 3' terminal region generally correlated with the 
current virus grouping.

Muscovy duck reovirus σC protein is atypically encoded by the smallest genome segment,"<jats:p>Although muscovy duck reovirus (DRV) shares properties with the reovirus isolated from chicken, commonly named avian reovirus (ARV), the two virus species are antigenically different. Similar to the DRV σB-encoded gene (1201 bp long) previously identified, the three other double-stranded RNA small genome segments of DRV have been cloned and sequenced. They were 1325, 1191 and 1124 bp long, respectively, and contained conserved terminal sequences common to ARVs. They coded for single expression products, except the smallest (S4), which contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). BLAST analyses revealed that the proteins encoded by the 1325 and 1191 bp genes shared high identity levels with ARV σA and σNS, respectively, and to a lesser extent with other orthoreovirus counterparts. No homology was found for the S4 ORF1-encoded p10 protein. The 29·4 kDa product encoded by S4 ORF2 appeared to be 25% identical to ARV S1 ORF3-encoded σC, a cell-attachment oligomer inducing type-specific neutralizing antibodies. Introduction of large gaps in the N-terminal part of the DRV protein was necessary to improve DRV and ARV σC amino acid sequence alignments. However, a leucine zipper motif was conserved and secondary structure analyses predicted a three-stranded α-helical coiled-coil feature at this amino portion. Thus, despite extensive sequence divergence, DRV σC was suggested to be structurally and probably functionally related to ARV σC. This work provides evidence for the diversity of the polycistronic S class genes of reoviruses isolated from birds and raises the question of the relative classification of DRV in the <jats:italic>Orthoreovirus</jats:italic> genus.</jats:p>",0

Sapoviruses (SaV) are enteric viruses infecting humans and animals. SaVs are 
highly diverse and are divided into multiple genogroups based on structural 
protein (VP1) sequences. SaVs detected from pigs belong to eight genogroups 
(GIII, GV, GVI, GVII, GVIII, GIX, GX, and GXI), but little is known about the 
SaV genogroup distribution in the Japanese pig population. In the present study, 
26 nearly complete genome (>6000 nucleotide: nt) and three partial sequences 
(2429nt, 4364nt, and 4419nt in length, including the entire VP1 coding region) 
of SaV were obtained from one diarrheic and 15 non-diarrheic porcine feces in 
Japan via a metagenomics approach. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP1 
amino acid sequence (aa) revealed that 29 porcine SaVs were classified into 
seven genogroups; GIII (11 strains), GV (1 strain), GVI (3 strains), GVII (6 
strains), GVIII (1 strain), GX (3 strains), and GXI (4 strains). This manuscript 
presents the first nearly complete genome sequences of GX and GXI, and 
demonstrates novel intergenogroup recombination events.

Twenty-three strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolated between 1988 and 
1999 in Republic of Korea were studied by partial nucleotide sequencing of 
fusion (F) gene and phylogenetic analysis. Most of Korean strains formed a 
distinctive cluster in genotype VI and they were genetically distant (4.0-8.7%) 
from other subtypes (a, b, c, d, and e), and termed provisionally VIf. Some 
Korean strains isolated in 1995 were grouped into genotype VIIa and they were 
closer to Taiwan strains than western Europe. The results suggest that the 
genotype VIf strains have been maintained by enzootic infections during the past 
decade, while genotype VIIa appears to be introduced more recently in Republic 
of Korea.

The first outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), H9N2 virus subtype, 
in 1996 prompted an eradication response, but LPAI returned to Korea in 1999. 
The relationship between the first and the recurrent viruses is unclear. To 
determine the molecular epizootiology of recurrent LPAI, we performed 
phylogenetic analysis with partial nucleotide sequences of four gene segments 
(HA, NA, NP and PB2) from eight chicken-origin H9N2 viruses. The recurrent H9N2 
viruses showed higher nucleotide similarity in haemagglutinin and neuraminidase 
genes to the 1996 Korean isolates than other Eurasian viruses, and formed a 
distinct cluster with the early Korean isolates and some isolates from migratory 
and domestic ducks in Japan and China. Phylogenetic analysis with internal genes 
showed that some Korean isolates formed a cluster with other subtypes, such as 
H5N1, H6N1, and H6N2 in China and Taiwan. These results suggest that the 
recurrent viruses are progeny of the early Korean H9N2 isolates, but further 
studies are required to explain their phylogenetic relatedness to viruses in 
China.

Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) is a novel porcine circovirus that was identified in 
pigs with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, reproductive failure, and 
multi-systemic inflammation. However, the distribution and genetic 
characteristics of emerging PCV3 in Korea remains unclear. In this study, we 
determined the nationwide prevalence and genetic characteristics of PCV3 using 
pen-based oral fluid samples. The total prevalence of PCV3 in individual samples 
and at the farm level was 44.2% (159/360) and 72.6% (53/73), respectively. 
Korean PCV3 shared 99.2±0.2% (98.9-99.8%) and 98.6±0.5% (97.9-99.8%) nucleotide 
identity in the complete genome and ORF2, respectively, when compared to those 
of US strains. These data suggested that PCV3 is widely distributed throughout 
Korean pig populations.

The H5N1 type A influenza viruses classified as Qinghai-like virus (clade 2.2) 
are a unique lineage of type A influenza viruses with the capacity to produce 
significant disease and mortality in gallinaceous and anseriform birds, 
including domestic and wild ducks. The objective of this study was to determine 
the susceptibility and pathogenesis of chickens and domestic ducks to A/Whooper 
Swan/Mongolia/224/05 (H5N1) high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus when 
administered through respiratory or alimentary routes of exposure. The chickens 
and ducks were more susceptible to the H5N1 HPAI virus, as evidenced by low 
infectious and lethal viral doses, when exposed by intranasal as compared to 
alimentary routes of inoculation (intragastric or oral-fed infected chicken 
meat). In the alimentary exposure pathogenesis study, pathologic changes 
included hemorrhage, necrosis, and inflammation in association with virus 
detection. These changes were generally observed in most of the visceral organs 
of chickens, between 2 and 4 days postinoculation (DPI), and are similar to 
lesions and virus localization seen in birds in natural cases or in experimental 
studies using the intranasal route. Alimentary exposure to the virus caused 
systemic infection in the ducks, characterized by moderate lymphocytic 
encephalitis, necrotized hepatitis, and pancreatitis with a corresponding 
demonstration of virus within the lesions. In both chickens and ducks with 
alimentary exposure, lesions, virus, or both were first demonstrated in the 
upper alimentary tract on 1 DPI, suggesting that the alimentary tract was the 
initial site affected upon consumption of infected meat or on gavage of virus in 
liquid medium. However, as demonstrated in the infectivity study in chickens, 
alimentary infection required higher exposure doses to produce infection as 
compared to intranasal exposure in chickens. These data suggest that upper 
respiratory exposure to H5N1 HPAI virus in birds is more likely to result in 
virus infection and transmission than will consumption of infected meat, unless 
the latter contains high doses of virus, as found in cannibalized infected 
carcasses.

Virological Surveillance and Preliminary Antigenic Characterization of Influenza Viruses in Pigs in Five European Countries from 2006 to 2008,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>This study presents the results of the virological surveillance for swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in Belgium, UK, Italy, France and Spain from 2006 to 2008. Our major aims were to clarify the occurrence of the three SIV subtypes – H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 – at regional levels, to identify novel reassortant viruses and to antigenically compare SIVs with human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. Lung tissue and/or nasal swabs from outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in pigs were investigated by virus isolation. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were determined using standard methods. Of the total 169 viruses, 81 were classified as ‘avian‐like’ H1N1, 36 as human‐like H3N2 and 47 as human‐like H1N2. Only five novel reassortant viruses were identified: two H1N1 viruses had a human‐like HA and three H1N2 viruses an avian‐like HA. All three SIV subtypes were detected in Belgium, Italy and Spain, while only H1N1 and H1N2 viruses were found in UK and Northwestern France. Cross‐hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests with hyperimmune sera against selected older and recent human influenza viruses showed a strong antigenic relationship between human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from the 1980s and H1N2 and H3N2 human‐like SIVs, confirming their common origin. However, antisera against human viruses isolated during the last decade did not react with currently circulating H1 or H3 SIVs, suggesting that especially young people may be, to some degree, susceptible to SIV infections.</jats:p>",0
"Genomic and phylogenetic characterization of viruses included in the Manzanilla and Oropouche species complexes of the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae","<jats:p>A thorough characterization of the genetic diversity of viruses present in vector and vertebrate host populations is essential for the early detection of and response to emerging pathogenic viruses, yet genetic characterization of many important viral groups remains incomplete. The Simbu serogroup of the genus <jats:italic>Orthobunyavirus</jats:italic>, family <jats:italic>Bunyaviridae</jats:italic>, is an example. The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a highly diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock species. Here, we report complete genome sequences for 11 viruses within this group, with a focus on the large and poorly characterized Manzanilla and Oropouche species complexes. Phylogenetic and pairwise divergence analyses indicated the presence of high levels of genetic diversity within these two species complexes, on a par with that seen among the five other species complexes in the Simbu serogroup. Based on previously reported divergence thresholds between species, the data suggested that these two complexes should actually be divided into at least five species. Together these five species formed a distinct phylogenetic clade apart from the rest of the Simbu serogroup. Pairwise sequence divergences among viruses of this clade and viruses in other Simbu serogroup species complexes were similar to levels of divergence among the other orthobunyavirus serogroups. The genetic data also suggested relatively high levels of natural reassortment, with three potential reassortment events present, including two well-supported events involving viruses known to infect humans.</jats:p>",0
Diversity of viruses detected by deep sequencing in pigs from a common background,"<jats:p> Although advances in nucleic acid sequencing have enabled the discovery of many infectious agents, challenges remain for scientists and veterinary diagnosticians trying to design animal studies with a minimum of variables and to interpret laboratory results. To evaluate pyrosequencing technology as a potential screening method to estimate the virome in pigs, fecal samples were collected from 4 pigs out of a group of 175 that had been raised together since birth. A number of viruses were detected, demonstrating the application of this technology to determine the background “noise” in the pigs. However, pyrosequencing also demonstrated the diversity of viruses within a group of animals and how that can confound experimental design and obscure a definitive diagnosis. </jats:p>",0

The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has caused several 
outbreaks in domestic poultry. Despite great efforts to control the spread of 
this virus, it continues to evolve and poses a substantial threat to public 
health because of a high mortality rate. In this study, we sequenced whole 
genomes of eight H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from domestic poultry in 
eastern China and compared them with those of typical influenza virus strains. 
Phylogenetic analyses showed that all eight genomes belonged to clade 2.3.2.1 
and clade 7.2, the two main circulating clades in China. Viruses that clustered 
in clade 2.3.2.1 shared a high degree of homology with H5N1 isolates located in 
eastern Asian. Isolates that clustered in clade 7.2 were found to circulate 
throughout China, with an east-to-west density gradient. Pathogenicity studies 
in mice showed that these isolates replicate in the lungs, and clade 2.3.2.1 
viruses exhibit a notably higher degree of virulence compared to clade 7.2 
viruses. Our results contribute to the elucidation of the biological 
characterization and pathogenicity of HPAI H5N1 viruses.

The genus Capripoxvirus (CaPV) comprises three members namely, sheep poxvirus 
(SPPV), goat poxvirus (GTPV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) affecting 
sheep, goats and cattle, respectively. CaPV infections produce similar symptoms 
in sheep and goats, and the three viruses cannot be distinguished serologically. 
Since there are conflicting opinions regarding the host specificity of CaPVs, 
particularly for goatpox and sheeppox viruses, the development of rapid 
genotyping tools will facilitate more accurate disease diagnosis and 
surveillance for better management of capripox outbreaks. This paper describes a 
species-specific, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), based on unique 
molecular markers that were found in the G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor 
(GPCR) gene sequences of CaPVs, that uses dual hybridization probes for their 
simultaneous detection, quantitation and genotyping. The assay can differentiate 
between CaPV strains based on differences in the melting point temperature (Tm) 
obtained after fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA). It is highly 
sensitive and presents low intra- and inter-run variation. This real time PCR 
assay will make a significant contribution to CaPV diagnosis and to the better 
understanding of the epidemiology of CaPVs by enabling rapid genotyping and 
gene-based classification of viral strains and unequivocal identification of 
isolates.

Pestiviruses of cattle include bovine viral diarrhoea 1 (BVDV-1) and 2 (BVDV-2) 
plus an emerging group, named HoBi-like pestivirus. In the present paper, the 
results of an epidemiological survey for pestiviruses circulating in cattle in 
southern Italy are presented. Molecular assays carried out on a total of 924 
bovine samples detected 74 BVDV strains, including 73 BVDV-1 and 1 BVDV-2 
viruses. Phylogenetic analysis carried out on partial 5'UTR and Npro sequences 
revealed the presence of 6 different subtypes of BVDV-1 and a single BVDV-2c 
strain. BVDV-1 displayed a high level of genetic heterogeneity, which can have 
both prophylactic and diagnostic implications. In addition, the detection of 
BVDV-2c highlights the need for a continuous surveillance for the emergence of 
new pestivirus strains in cattle farms in southern Italy.

Bocaparvovirus is a newly established genus within the family Parvoviridae and 
has been identified as a possible cause of enteric, respiratory, 
reproductive/neonatal and neurological disease in humans and several animal 
species. In this study, metagenomic analysis was used to identify and 
characterise a novel bocaparvovirus in the faeces of rabbits with enteric 
disease. To assess the prevalence of the novel virus, rectal swabs and faecal 
samples obtained from rabbits with and without diarrhoea were screened with a 
specific PCR assay. The complete genome sequence of the novel parvovirus was 
reconstructed. The virus was distantly related to other bocaparvoviruses; the 
three ORFs shared 53%, 53% and 50% nucleotide identity, respectively, to 
homologous genes of porcine bocaparvoviruses. The virus was detected in 8/29 
(28%) and 16/95 (17%) samples of rabbits with and without diarrhoea, 
respectively. Sequencing of the capsid protein fragment targeted by the 
diagnostic PCR identified two distinct bocaparvovirus populations/sub-types, 
with 91.7-94.5% nucleotide identity to each other. Including these novel 
parvoviruses in diagnostic algorithms of rabbit diseases might help inform their 
potential pathogenic role and impact on rabbit production and the virological 
profiles of laboratory rabbits.

Three novel canine papillomaviruses support taxonomic clade formation,"<jats:p>More than 100 human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been identified and had their whole genomes sequenced. Most of these HPVs can be classified into three distinct genera, the alpha-, beta- and gamma-papillomaviruses (PVs). Of note, only one or a small number of PVs have been identified for each individual animal species. However, four canine PVs (CPVs) (COPV, CPV2, CPV3 and CPV4) have been described and their entire genomic sequences have been published. Based on their sequence similarities, they belong to three distinct clades. In the present study, circular viral DNA was amplified from three dogs showing signs of pigmented plaques, endophytic papilloma or<jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>squamous cell carcinoma. Analysis of the DNA sequences suggested that these are three novel viruses (CPV5, CPV6 and CPV7) whose genomes comprise all the conserved sequence elements of known PVs. The genomes of these seven CPVs were compared in order properly classify them. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses, as well as pairwise sequence alignments of the putative amino acid sequences, revealed that CPV5 grouped well with CPV3 and CPV4, whereas CPV7 grouped with CPV2 but neither group fitted with other classified PVs. However, CPV6 grouped with COPV, a lambda-PV. Based on this evidence, allocation of CPVs into three distinct clades could therefore be supported. Thus, similar to HPVs, it might be that the known and currently unknown CPVs are related and form just a few clades or genera.</jats:p>",0

Several important human diseases worldwide are caused by tick-borne viruses. 
These diseases have become important public health concerns in recent years. The 
tick-borne viruses that cause diseases in humans mainly belong to 3 families: 
Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Reoviridae. In this review, we focus on 
therapeutic approaches for several of the more important tick-borne viruses from 
these 3 families. These viruses are Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF) 
and the newly discovered tick-borne phleboviruses, known as thrombocytopenia 
syndromevirus (SFTSV), Heartland virus and Bhanja virus from the family 
Bunyaviridae, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Powassan virus (POWV), 
Louping-ill virus (LIV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Kyasanur Forest 
disease virus (KFDV), and Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) from the 
Flaviviridae family. To date, there is no effective antiviral drug available 
against most of these tick-borne viruses. Although there is common usage of 
antiviral drugs such as ribavirin for CCHF treatment in some countries, there 
are concerns that ribavirin may not be as effective as once thought against 
CCHF. Herein, we discuss also the availability of vaccines for the control of 
these viral infections. The lack of treatment and prevention approaches for 
these viruses is highlighted, and we hope that this review may increase public 
health awareness with regard to the threat posed by this group of viruses.

Blood transcriptomes reveal novel parasitic zoonoses circulating in Madagascar's lemurs,"<jats:p>
            Zoonotic diseases are a looming threat to global populations, and nearly 75% of emerging infectious diseases can spread among wildlife, domestic animals and humans. A ‘One World, One Health’ perspective offers us an ideal framework for understanding and potentially mitigating the spread of zoonoses, and the island of Madagascar serves as a natural laboratory for conducting these studies. Rapid habitat degradation and climate change on the island are contributing to more frequent contact among humans, livestock and wildlife, increasing the potential for pathogen spillover events. Given Madagascar's long geographical isolation, coupled with recent and repeated introduction of agricultural and invasive species, it is likely that a number of circulating pathogens remain uncharacterized in lemur populations. Thus, it is imperative that new approaches be implemented for de novo pathogen discovery. To this end, we used non-targeted deep sequencing of blood transcriptomes from two species of critically endangered wild lemurs (
            <jats:italic>Indri indri</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Propithecus diadema</jats:italic>
            ) to characterize blood-borne pathogens. Our results show several undescribed vector-borne parasites circulating within lemurs, some of which may cause disease in wildlife, livestock and humans. We anticipate that advanced methods for de novo identification of unknown pathogens will have broad utility for characterizing other complex disease transmission systems.

Characterization of a New Potyvirus Naturally Infecting Chickpea,"<jats:p> During the 1999 to 2001 growing seasons, symptoms consisting of mosaic, stunting, yellowing, wilting, shortening of internodes, and phloem discoloration were observed in chickpea (Cicer arietinum) grown in the Department of Chuquisaca in southern Bolivia. In some fields, approximately 10% of the plants exhibited viruslike symptoms and suffered greatly reduced seed yields. Lentil (Lens culinaris) was also observed to be infected but not pea (Pisum sativum) or faba bean (Vicia faba) growing in nearby fields. Infected chickpea tissue reacted positively to the potyvirus group-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), but there was no serological reaction with antisera to the potyviruses Bean yellow mosaic virus, Clover yellow vein virus, Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus, Pea seedborne mosaic virus, Bean common mosaic virus, or Bean common mosaic necrosis virus. Western blots of total protein extracts probed with the potyvirus MAb revealed a single band ca. 32 kDa. Comparative sequence analysis of cDNA clones generated from the putative coat protein gene consisted of 282 amino acids (31.9 kDa) and showed moderate identities of 67, 66, 63, 63, and 61% with the coat proteins of potyviruses Pepper severe mosaic virus, Pepper yellow mosaic virus, Potato virus Y, Plum pox virus, and Pepper mottle virus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the coat protein amino acid sequence revealed that this virus is a unique member of the family Potyviridae and is phylogenetically most closely related to a group of Solanaceae-infecting potyviruses rather than to other legumeinfecting potyviruses. The proposed name for the new causal agent is Chickpea yellow mosaic virus. </jats:p>",0
Discovery and Sequence Analysis of Four Deltacoronaviruses from Birds in the Middle East Reveal Interspecies Jumping with Recombination as a Potential Mechanism for Avian-to-Avian and Avian-to-Mammalian Transmission,"<jats:p>During an attempt to explore the diversity of deltacoronaviruses among mammals and birds in Dubai, four novel deltacoronaviruses were detected in fecal samples from eight birds of four different species: FalCoV UAE-HKU27 from a falcon, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 from a houbara bustard, PiCoV UAE-HKU29 from a pigeon, and QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 from five quails. Genome analysis revealed evidence of recent interspecies transmission between falcons and their prey, houbara bustards and pigeons, possibly along the food chain, as well as avian-to-swine transmission. Recombination, which is known to occur frequently in some coronaviruses, was also common among these deltacoronaviruses and occurred predominantly at the spike region. Such recombination, involving the receptor binding protein, may contribute to the emergence of new viruses capable of infecting new hosts. Birds in the Middle East are hosts for diverse deltacoronaviruses with potential for interspecies transmission.</jats:p>",0
Chickens host diverse picornaviruses originated from potential interspecies transmission with recombination,"<jats:p>While chickens are an important reservoir for emerging pathogens such as avian influenza viruses, little is known about the diversity of picornaviruses in poultry. We discovered a previously unknown diversity of picornaviruses in chickens in Hong Kong. Picornaviruses were detected in 87 cloacal and 7 tracheal samples from 93 of 900 chickens by reverse transcription-PCR, with their partial 3D<jats:sup>pol</jats:sup> gene sequences forming five distinct clades (I to V) among known picornaviruses. Analysis of eight genomes from different clades revealed seven different picornaviruses, including six novel picornavirus species (ChPV1 from clade I, ChPV2 and ChPV3 from clade II, ChPV4 and ChPV5 from clade III, ChGV1 from clade IV) and one existing species (<jats:italic>Avian encephalomyelitis virus</jats:italic> from clade V). The six novel chicken picornavirus genomes exhibited distinct phylogenetic positions and genome features different from related picornaviruses, supporting their classification as separate species. Moreover, ChPV1 may potentially belong to a novel genus, with low sequence homologies to related picornaviruses, especially in the P1 and P2 regions, including the predicted L and 2A proteins. Nevertheless, these novel picornaviruses were most closely related to picornaviruses of other avian species (ChPV1 related to <jats:italic>Passerivirus</jats:italic> 
                  <jats:italic>A</jats:italic>, ChPV2 and ChPV3 to <jats:italic>Avisivirus A</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Duck hepatitis A virus</jats:italic>, ChPV4 and ChPV5 to <jats:italic>Melegrivirus</jats:italic> A, ChGV1 to <jats:italic>Gallivirus A</jats:italic>). Furthermore, ChPV5 represented a potential recombinant picornavirus, with its P2 and P3 regions possibly originating from <jats:italic>Melegrivirus A</jats:italic>. Chickens are an important reservoir for diverse picornaviruses that may cross avian species barriers through mutation or recombination.</jats:p>",0

Emerging viruses represent a continuous threat to human health and to farmed 
animals, as evidenced on multiple occasions by outbreaks of influenza, 
henipavirus and SARS. Knowledge about the diversity of viromes present in 
reservoir species can lead to a better understanding of the origin of emerging 
pathogens. In this study, we extend the knowledge of astrovirus diversity in 
pigs by reporting the genetic characterization of an unknown astrovirus lineage. 
Phylogenetic analyses provided evidence that this porcine astrovirus lineage is 
unique and does not appear to share a recent common ancestor with any known 
mamastrovirus. The data reported in this study extend the number of porcine 
astrovirus lineages to a total of five, all of which most likely represent 
distinct species of different origins.

The nucleoprotein gene (ORF7) of 15 European isolates of porcine reproductive 
and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was sequenced and compared with 
corresponding sequences of other PRRSV isolates (2 European and 13 American) and 
one isolate each of other arteriviruses (the lactate dehydrogenase elevating 
virus (LDV), the simian haemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) and the equine arteritis 
virus (EAV)). Their phylogenetic relationships were established using 
neighbour-joining and parsimony methods. Four lineages (PRRSV, LDV, SHFV and 
EAV) were discriminated. Two genotypes of PRRSV, European and American, could be 
further identified. The European genotype of PRRSV was highly conserved. 
Analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid substitutions in PRRSV ORF7 revealed 
four stable regions, probably conserved because of their requirement for 
nucleocapsid function and/or structure. No constant mutations accumulation in 
the ORF7 could be determined precisely when either synonymous or non-synonymous 
mutations were studied. Passage of the European PRRSV in vivo had little 
influence on the ORF7 sequence: only a small number of synonymous substitutions 
in ORF7 was detectable, confirming its low variability.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a major cause of endemic outbreaks in Vietnam in 
recent years. In this work, six serotype A foot-and-mouth disease viruses 
(FMDV), collected from endemic outbreaks during January and February of 2009 in 
four different provinces in Vietnam, were genetically characterized for their 
complete genome sequences. Genetic analysis based on the complete viral genome 
sequence indicated that they were closely related to each other and shared 
99.0-99.8% amino acid (aa) identity. Genetic and deduced aa analysis of the 
capsid coding gene VP1 showed that the six Vietnamese strains were all 
classified into the genotype IX from a total of 10 major genotypes worldwide, 
sharing 98.1-100% aa identity each other. They were most closely related to the 
type A strains recently isolated in Laos (A/LAO/36/2003, A/LAO/1/2006, 
A/LAO/6/2006, A/LAO/7/2006, and A/LAO/8/2006), Thailand (A/TAI/2/1997 and 
A/TAI/118/1987), and Malaysia (A/MAY/2/2002), sharing 88.3-95.5% nucleotide (nt) 
identities. In contrast, Vietnamese type A strains showed low nt identities with 
the two old type A FMDVs, isolated in 1960 in Thailand (a15thailand iso43) and 
in 1975 in the Philippines (aphilippines iso50), ranging from 77.3 to 80.9% nt 
identity. A multiple alignment based on the deduced amino acid sequences of the 
capsid VP1 coding gene of type A FMDV revealed three amino acid substitutions 
between Vietnamese strains and the strains of other Southeast Asian countries 
(Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines). Alanine was replaced by valine 
at residue 24, asparagine by arginine at residue 85, and serine by threonine at 
residue 196. Furthermore, type A FMDV strains recently isolated in Vietnam, 
Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia all have one amino acid deletion at residue 140 of 
the capsid VP1 protein compared with the two old type A FMDV strains from 
Thailand and the Philippines as well as most other type A representatives 
worldwide. This article is the first to report on the comprehensive genetic 
characterization of type A FMDV circulating in Vietnam.

Six field foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDVs), including four serotype O and 
two serotype Asia 1 strains, were collected from endemic outbreaks in 2005, 
2006, and 2007 from four different provinces in Vietnam. The viruses were 
isolated and genetically characterized for their complete genomic sequences. The 
genetic analysis based on the complete genomic coding sequences revealed that 
the four serotype O FMDVs were related to each other, sharing 95.2% nucleotide 
(nt) identity and 97.5-97.6% amino acid (aa) identity. Genetic analysis and a 
phylogenetic tree, based on the VP1 gene of FMDV, showed that the four present 
Vietnamese serotype O strains have a high level of identity with other serotype 
O representatives of the Mya-98 lineage of the Southeast Asian (SEA) topotype. 
The four viruses were all clustered into the Mya-98 lineage of the SEA topotype, 
sharing 92.3-95.6% nt and 93.4-96.7% aa identity. This finding of the Mya-98 
lineage was different from previous reports that the Vietnamese serotype O 
strains belonged to the Cam-94 lineage of the SEA topotype and two other 
topotypes, Middle East-South Asia (ME-SA) and Cathay. For the two serotype Asia 
1 FMDVs, the genetic analysis based on the complete genomic coding sequences as 
well as on the VP1 gene revealed that they belonged to two genogroups, IV and V. 
Of note, the As1/VN/QT03/2007 strain of genogroup V, isolated in 2007, was very 
closely related to the pandemic Asia 1 strain which caused FMD outbreaks in 
China (Asia1/WHN/CHA/06, FJ906802) and Mongolia (Asia1/MOG/05, EF614458) in 
2005, sharing 99.0-99.3% nt and 99.5-100% aa identity. In contrast, the second 
strain As1/VN/LC04/2005 of genogroup IV, isolated in 2005, was closely related 
to all referenced Vietnamese serotype Asia 1 strains found in the GenBank 
databases, sharing 86.4-100% nt and 90.9-100% aa identity with each. This study 
is the first description of the full-length genomic sequence of Vietnamese FMDV 
serotypes O and Asia 1 and may provide the evidence of the concurrent 
circulation of different serotypes and subtypes of FMDV in recent years in 
Vietnam.

To date, all isolated highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses that 
cause systemic infection with a high mortality rate in poultry species have been 
known to belong to either the H5 or H7 subtypes. The HPAI viruses may originate 
because of the insertion of multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of 
the hemagglutinin protein after the low-pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses have been 
introduced into poultry. In the present study, we investigated the phylogenetic 
characteristics of the H5 (n = 4) and H7 (n = 3) low-pathogenic avian influenza 
(LPAI) viruses isolated from wild birds in Korea by using nucleotide sequences 
of all 8 gene segments of the viral genome. Further, we evaluated the 
infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenic potential of these viruses in 
chickens. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all viruses used in the study 
clustered in the Eurasian lineage and were similar to the viruses isolated in 
Asian countries that share the East Asian-Australasian migratory bird flyway. 
Our H5N2 isolates could not be replicated and transmitted in chickens, but the 
H7N8 isolates could efficiently be replicated and transmitted to 
contact-exposure chickens. In addition, because our H7N8 isolates caused watery 
diarrhea in chickens, these viruses cannot only serve as progenitors of novel 
HPAI strains but also potentially cause clinical disease in poultry. Although 
there have been no reports of LPAI mutation to HPAI in these regions, the wild 
bird surveillance effort should focus on monitoring the introduction and 
transmission of the HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H5 and H7 viruses.

To expand the epidemiological understanding of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) 
found in domestic ducks in Korea, 14 NDV isolates from apparently healthy 
domestic ducks were biologically and genetically characterized. Thirteen and 1 
isolates of NDV were categorized into lentogenic and velogenic viruses, 
respectively, based on in vivo pathogenicity tests. Twelve lentogenic viruses 
showed HA activity to horse RBCs, while 1 lentogenic virus and the velogenic 
virus were negative. Lentogenic viruses (n=13) had sequence motifs of 
(112)ERQERL(117) (n=1) or (112)GRQGRL(117) (n=12) at the F0 cleavage site, while 
the velogenic virus (n=1) had a sequence motif of (112)RRQKRF(117) at the same 
site. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least three distinct genotypes may 
exist in domestic ducks in Korea; one class I genotype (genotype 2), and two 
class II (genotypes I and VII) genotypes. The class I virus was most closely 
related to strains of genotype 2 which were isolated in birds from the USA, 
Germany and Denmark. Twelve lentogenic class II viruses were grouped together in 
genotype I, and were then divided into at least three clusters, namely 
Aomori-like, Ulster2C-like, and V4-like. The velogenic class II virus was 
assigned to genotype VII which represents viruses responsible for recent 
epidemics in many Asian countries including Korea. The epidemiological 
importance of domestic duck isolates of NDV in Korea is discussed.

Thirty-three field isolates of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were 
recovered from commercial chicken flocks in Korea between 2003 and 2006 and were 
characterized phylogenetically by nucleotide sequence analysis of the IBV S1 
gene hyper-variable region. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that recent field 
isolates of IBV formed at least three distinct phylogenetic types, including 
K-I, K-II, and K-III. K-I type IBV consisted of indigenous, 13 IBV isolates 
which evolved from the Kr-EJ/95 strain and then separated into the lineages of 
type K-Ia and type K-Ib. K-II type IBV isolates (n = 19) were closely related to 
nephropathogenic IBV variants from China and Japan. The K-III type isolate 
(Kr/D064/05), first identified by this study, was closely related to enteric IBV 
variants from the Chinese strains that cause proventriculitis. Sequence 
comparisons showed amino acid differences of >27.5% between IBV types. The 
molecular epidemiologic characteristics of IBV field isolates are briefly 
discussed.

Oxford, OX1 3RE, United Kingdom.

The genome sequence of Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV), an unclassified member of 
the yatapoxvirus genus, has been determined. Excluding the terminal hairpin 
loops, the YLDV genome is 144,575 bp in length and contains inverted terminal 
repeats (ITRs) of 1883 bp. Within 20 nucleotides of the termini, there is a 
sequence that is conserved in other poxviruses and is required for the 
resolution of concatemeric replicative DNA intermediates. The nucleotide 
composition of the genome is 73% A+T, but the ITRs are only 63% A+T. The genome 
contains 151 tightly packed open reading frames (ORFs) that either are > or =180 
nucleotides in length or are conserved in other poxviruses. ORFs within 23 kb of 
each end are transcribed toward the termini, whereas ORFs within the central 
region of the genome are encoded on either DNA strand. In the central region 
ORFs have a conserved position, orientation, and sequence compared with vaccinia 
virus ORFs and encode many enzymes, transcription factors, or structural 
proteins. In contrast, ORFs near the termini are more divergent and in seven 
cases are without counterparts in other poxviruses. The YLDV genome encodes 
several predicted immunomodulators; examples include two proteins with 
similarity to CC chemokine receptors and predicted secreted proteins with 
similarity to MHC class I antigen, OX-2, interleukin-10/mda-7, poxvirus growth 
factor, serpins, and a type I interferon-binding protein. Phylogenic analyses 
indicated that YLDV is very closely related to yaba monkey tumor virus, but 
outside the yatapoxvirus genus YLDV is more closely related to swinepox virus 
and leporipoxviruses than to other chordopoxvirus genera.

We compared the genetic and biologic characteristics of 35 influenza viruses of 
different epidemiological backgrounds in Korea, including H3N2 canine influenza 
virus (CIV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that chicken adapted H9N2 viruses 
(A/chicken/Korea/96006/96 [CK/Kor/96006-like]) have acquired aquatic avian gene 
segments through reassortment, and these reassorted H9N2 viruses were more 
frequently detected from minor poultry species than from industrial poultry. 
Conversely, gene segments from CK/Kor/96006-like viruses were also detected in 
most of the viruses from domestic ducks. Interestingly, domestic ducks, rather 
than wild aquatic birds, harbored close relatives of all eight gene segments of 
H3N2 CIV, which preferred binding to avian receptors. Therefore, bidirectional 
virus transmission events are assumed to have occurred between land-based 
poultry and aquatic poultry, in particular within the non-industrial poultry 
system. These events have contributed to the generation of a novel reassortant, 
H3N2 CIV. To prevent generating other reassortants capable of interspecies 
transmission, gene movements in the non-industrial poultry systems should be 
clarified and managed.

The potential use of specific somatic coliphage taxonomic groups as viral 
indicators based on their persistence and prevalence in water was investigated. 
Representative type strains of the 4 major somatic coliphage taxonomic groups 
were seeded into reagent water and an ambient surface water source of drinking 
water and the survival of the added phages was measured over 90 days at 
temperatures of 23-25 and 4 °C. Microviridae (type strain PhiX174), Siphoviridae 
(type strain Lambda), and Myoviridae (type strain T4) viruses were the most 
persistent in water at the temperatures tested. The Microviridae (type strain 
PhiX174) and the Siphoviridae (type strain Lambda) were the most resistant 
viruses to UV radiation and the Myoviridae (type strain T4) and the Microviridae 
(type strain PhiX174) were the most resistant viruses to heat. Based on their 
greater persistence in water over time and their relative resistance to heat 
and/or UV radiation, the Myoviridae (type strain T4), the Microviridae (type 
strain PhiX174), and the Siphoviridae (type strain Lambda) were the preferred 
candidate somatic coliphages as fecal indicator viruses in water, with the 
Microviridae (type strain PhiX174) the most resistant to these conditions 
overall.

BACKGROUND: Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) is an alphaherpesvirus 
that causes acute respiratory disease in chickens worldwide. To date, only one 
complete genomic sequence of ILTV has been reported. This sequence was generated 
by concatenating partial sequences from six different ILTV strains. Thus, the 
full genomic sequence of a single (individual) strain of ILTV has not been 
determined previously. This study aimed to use high throughput sequencing 
technology to determine the complete genomic sequence of a live attenuated 
vaccine strain of ILTV.
RESULTS: The complete genomic sequence of the Serva vaccine strain of ILTV was 
determined, annotated and compared to the concatenated ILTV reference sequence. 
The genome size of the Serva strain was 152,628 bp, with a G + C content of 48%. 
A total of 80 predicted open reading frames were identified. The Serva strain 
had 96.5% DNA sequence identity with the concatenated ILTV sequence. Notably, 
the concatenated ILTV sequence was found to lack four large regions of sequence, 
including 528 bp and 594 bp of sequence in the UL29 and UL36 genes, 
respectively, and two copies of a 1,563 bp sequence in the repeat regions. 
Considerable differences in the size of the predicted translation products of 4 
other genes (UL54, UL30, UL37 and UL38) were also identified. More than 530 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Most SNPs were located 
within three genomic regions, corresponding to sequence from the SA-2 ILTV 
vaccine strain in the concatenated ILTV sequence.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first complete genomic sequence of an individual ILTV 
strain. This sequence will facilitate future comparative genomic studies of ILTV 
by providing an appropriate reference sequence for the sequence analysis of 
other ILTV strains.

            family) transmitted by mosquitoes. It infects humans and ruminants, causing dramatic epidemics and epizootics in Africa, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. While recent studies demonstrated the importance of the nonstructural protein NSs as a major component of virulence in vertebrates, little is known about infection of mosquito vectors. Here we studied RVFV infection in three different mosquito cell lines, Aag2 cells from
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Aedes aegypti</jats:named-content>
            and U4.4 and C6/36 cells from
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Aedes albopictus</jats:named-content>
            . In contrast with mammalian cells, where NSs forms nuclear filaments, U4.4 and Aag2 cells downregulated NSs expression such that NSs filaments were never formed in nuclei of U4.4 cells and disappeared at an early time postinfection in the case of Aag2 cells. On the contrary, in C6/36 cells, NSs nuclear filaments were visible during the entire time course of infection. Analysis of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) by deep sequencing indicated that production of viRNAs was very low in C6/36 cells, which are known to be Dicer-2 deficient but expressed some viRNAs presenting a Piwi signature. In contrast, Aag2 and U4.4 cells produced large amounts of viRNAs predominantly matching the S segment and displaying Dicer-2 and Piwi signatures. Whereas 21-nucleotide (nt) Dicer-2 viRNAs were prominent during early infection, the population of 24- to 27-nt Piwi RNAs (piRNAs) increased progressively and became predominant later during the acute infection and during persistence. In Aag2 and U4.4 cells, the combined actions of the Dicer-2 and Piwi pathways triggered an efficient antiviral response permitting, among other actions, suppression of NSs filament formation and allowing establishment of persistence. In C6/36 cells, Piwi-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) appeared to be sufficient to mount an antiviral response against a secondary infection with a superinfecting virus. This study provides new insights into the role of Dicer and Piwi in mosquito antiviral defense and the development of the antiviral response in mosquitoes.

Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant and diverse biological entities in 
our planet. They infect susceptible bacterial hosts into which they either 
multiply or persist. In the latter case, phages can confer new functions to 
their hosts as a result of gene transfer, thus contributing to their adaptation 
(short-term) and evolution (long-term). In this regard, the role of phages on 
the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacterial hosts in 
natural environments has not yet been clearly resolved. Here, we carry out a 
comprehensive analysis of thirty-three viromes from different habitats to 
investigate whether phages harbor ARGs. Our results demonstrate that while 
human-associated viromes do not or rarely carry ARGs, viromes from non-human 
sources (e.g. pig feces, raw sewage, and freshwater and marine environments) 
contain a large reservoir of ARGs, thus pointing out that phages could play a 
part on the spread of antibiotic resistance. Given this, the role of phages 
should not be underestimated and it should be considered when designing 
strategies to tackle the global crisis of antibiotic resistance.

Nucleotide sequence analysis and expression from recombinant vectors demonstrate that the attachment protein G of bovine respiratory syncytial virus is distinct from that of human respiratory syncytial virus,"<jats:p>Bovine respiratory syncytial (BRS) virus causes a severe lower respiratory tract disease in calves similar to the disease in children caused by human respiratory syncytial (HRS) virus. While there is antigenic cross-reactivity among the other major viral structural proteins, the major glycoprotein, G, of BRS virus and that of HRS virus are antigenically distinct. The G glycoprotein has been implicated as the attachment protein for HRS virus. We have carried out a molecular comparison of the glycoprotein G of BRS virus with the HRS virus counterparts. cDNA clones corresponding to the BRS virus G glycoprotein mRNA were isolated and analyzed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The BRS virus G mRNA contained 838 nucleotides exclusive of poly(A) and had a major open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 257 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the BRS virus G polypeptide showed only 29 to 30% amino acid identity with the G protein of either the subgroup A or B HRS virus. However, despite this low level of identity, there were strong similarities in the predicted hydropathy profiles of the BRS virus and HRS virus G proteins. A cDNA molecule containing the complete BRS virus G major open reading frame was inserted into the thymidine kinase gene of vaccinia virus by homologous recombination, and a recombinant virus containing the BRS virus G protein gene was isolated. This recombinant virus expressed the BRS virus G protein, as demonstrated by Western immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence of infected cells. The BRS virus G protein expressed from the recombinant vector was transported to and expressed on the surface of infected cells. Antisera to the BRS virus G protein made by using the recombinant vector to immunize animals recognized the BRS virus attachment protein but not the HRS virus G protein and vice versa, confirming the lack of antigenic cross-reactivity between the BRS and HRS virus attachment proteins. On the basis of the data presented here, we conclude that BRS virus should be classified within the genus Pneumovirus in a group separate from HRS virus and that it is no more closely related to HRS virus subgroup A than it is to HRS virus subgroup B.</jats:p>",0

Since two genotypes of bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) occur in Belgian 
herds, their differentiation is important for disease surveillance. A 
quantitative real-time PCR assay was developed to detect and classify bovine 
viral diarrhea viruses in genotype I and II. A pair of primers specific for 
highly conserved regions of the 5'UTR and two TaqMan probes were designed. The 
FAM and VIC-labeled probe sequences differed by three nucleotides, allowing the 
differentiation between genotype I and II. The assay detectability of genotype I 
and II real-time PCR assay was 1000 and 100 copies, respectively. Highly 
reproducible data were obtained as the coefficients of variation of threshold 
cycle values in inter-runs were less than 2.2%. The correct classification of 
genotype I and II viruses was assessed by using reference strains and 
characterized field isolates of both genotypes. The application to clinical 
diagnosis was evaluated on pooled blood samples by post run measurement of the 
FAM- and VIC-associated fluorescence. The 100% agreement with the conventional 
RT-PCR method confirmed that this new technique could be used for routine 
detection of persistently infected immunotolerant animals.

A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed to 
differentiate the bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV) from other pestiviruses, and to 
determine the genotype of the BVDV isolates. For this purpose, primer pairs were 
selected in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). The primers BE and B2 were 
located in highly conserved regions and were pestivirus-specific. Two primer 
pairs named B3B4 and B5B6 were specific of BVDV genotypes I and II, 
respectively. With this technique, an amplification product of the expected size 
was obtained with either the B3B4 or the B5B6 primer pairs for the 107 BVDV 
isolates tested but not for BDV or CSFV. For some isolates that were grouped in 
the genotype II, sequence analysis of the PCR fragments confirmed their 
classification into this genotype.

The Caucasus, at the border of Europe and Asia, is important for migration and 
over-wintering of wild waterbirds. Three flyways, the Central Asian, East 
Africa-West Asia, and Mediterranean/Black Sea flyways, converge in the Caucasus 
region. Thus, the Caucasus region might act as a migratory bridge for influenza 
virus transmission when birds aggregate in high concentrations in the 
post-breeding, migrating and overwintering periods. Since August 2009, we have 
established a surveillance network for influenza viruses in wild birds, using 
five sample areas geographically spread throughout suitable habitats in both 
eastern and western Georgia. We took paired tracheal and cloacal swabs and fresh 
feces samples. We collected 8343 swabs from 76 species belonging to 17 families 
in 11 orders of birds, of which 84 were real-time RT-PCR positive for avian 
influenza virus (AIV). No highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) H5 or H7 viruses were 
detected. The overall AIV prevalence was 1.6%. We observed peak prevalence in 
large gulls during the autumn migration (5.3-9.8%), but peak prevalence in 
Black-headed Gulls in spring (4.2-13%). In ducks, we observed increased AIV 
prevalence during the autumn post-moult aggregations and migration stop-over 
period (6.3%) but at lower levels to those observed in other more northerly 
post-moult areas in Eurasia. We observed another prevalence peak in the 
overwintering period (0.14-5.9%). Serological and virological monitoring of a 
breeding colony of Armenian Gulls showed that adult birds were seropositive on 
arrival at the breeding colony, but juveniles remained serologically and 
virologically negative for AIV throughout their time on the breeding grounds, in 
contrast to gull AIV data from other geographic regions. We show that close 
phylogenetic relatives of viruses isolated in Georgia are sourced from a wide 
geographic area throughout Western and Central Eurasia, and from areas that are 
represented by multiple different flyways, likely linking different host 
sub-populations.

Foot-and-mouth disease virus is an economically important animal virus that 
exhibits extensive genetic and antigenic heterogeneity. To examine the 
evolutionary forces that have influenced the population dynamics of 
foot-and-mouth disease virus, individual genes and the coding genomes for the 
Eurasian (Asia1, A, C, and O) serotypes were examined for phylogenetic 
relationships, recombination, genetic diversity and selection. Our analyses 
demonstrate that paraphyletic relationships among serotypes are not as prevalent 
as previously proposed and suggest that convergent evolution might be obscuring 
phylogenetic relationships. We provide evidence that identification of 
recombinant sequences and recombination breakpoint patterns among and within 
serotypes are heavily dependent on the level of genetic diversity and convergent 
characters present in a particular data set as well as the methods used to 
detect recombination. Here, we also investigate the impact of adaptive positive 
selection on the capsid proteins and the non-structural genes 2B, 2C, 3A, and 
3Cpro to identify genome regions involved in genetic diversity and antigenic 
variation. Two different categories of positive selection at the amino acid 
level were examined; conservative (stabilizing) selection that maintains 
particular phenotypic properties of an amino acid residue and radical 
(destabilizing), and selection that dramatically alters the phenotype and 
potentially the functional and/or structural features of the protein. 
Approximately, 29% of residues in the capsid proteins were under positive 
selection. Of those, 64% were under the influence of destabilizing selection, 
80% were under the influence of stabilizing selection, and 44% had phenotypic 
properties influenced by both selection types. The majority of residues under 
selection (74%) were located outside of known antigenic sites; suggestive of 
additional uncharacterized epitopes and genomic regions involved in antigenic 
drift.

Although previous publications suggest the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 
virus was reassorted from swine viruses of North America and Eurasia, the 
immediate ancestry still remains elusive due to the big evolutionary distance 
between the 2009 H1N1 virus and the previously isolated strains. Since the 
unveiling of the 2009 H1N1 influenza, great deal of interest has been drawn to 
influenza, consequently a large number of influenza virus sequences have been 
deposited into the public sequence databases. Blast analysis demonstrated that 
the recently submitted 2007 South Dakota avian influenza virus strains and other 
North American avian strains contained genetic segments very closely related to 
the 2009 H1N1 virus, which suggests these avian influenza viruses are very close 
relatives of the 2009 H1N1 virus. Phylogenetic analyses also indicate that the 
2009 H1N1 viruses are associated with both avian and swine influenza viruses 
circulating in North America. Since the migrating wild birds are preferable to 
pigs as the carrier to spread the influenza viruses across vast distances, it is 
very likely that birds played an important role in the inter-continental 
evolution of the 2009 H1N1 virus. It is essential to understand the evolutionary 
route of the emerging influenza virus in order to find a way to prevent further 
emerging cases. This study suggests the close relationship between 2009 pandemic 
virus and the North America avian viruses and underscores enhanced surveillance 
of influenza in birds for understanding the evolution of the 2009 pandemic 
influenza.

"Origin, Genetic Diversity, and Evolutionary Dynamics of Novel Porcine Circovirus 3","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) is a novel virus associated with acute PDNS (porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome)‐like clinical signs identified by metagenomic sequencing from swine. Its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes resulting in the emergence and spread of PCV3 remain poorly understood. Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single‐stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.</jats:p>",0

Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is classified to the family Herpesviridae, but has 
not been grouped into any genus so far. Four overlapped fragments were amplified 
from the DEV genome with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The assembled length 
of the four fragments was 6,202 bp, which contained the genes encoding unique 
long (UL) 24, thymidine kinase (TK) and glycoprotein H (gH) proteins. The UL24 
overlapped with TK by 64 nucleotides (nt), in a head-to-head transcription 
orientation, and the TK and gH had the same transcription orientation. The 
comparison of amino acid sequences of these 3 deduced DEV proteins with other 12 
alphaherpesviruses displayed 5 highly conserved sites in the UL24, as well as 
another 5 consensus regions in the TK and 4 consensus regions in the gH. The RNA 
polymerase II transcriptional control elements were identified in all the UL24, 
TK and gH of DEV. These elements included core promoters, TATA motifs and 
polyadenylation sites. Phylogenetic analysis for the genetic classification of 
DEV in the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily with other 12 alphaherpesviruses was 
computed. The result showed that DEV was more closely related to avian 
herpesviruses, except infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), than to other 
alphaherpesviruses. Conclusively, according to the phylogenesis-based analysis 
and the homology comparison of functional domains of UL24, TK and gH, DEV should 
be classified to a separate genus of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily in the 
family Herpesviridae.

"Avian Influenza Virus Subtype H9N2 Affects Intestinal Microbiota, Barrier Structure Injury, and Inflammatory Intestinal Disease in the Chicken Ileum","<jats:p>Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 (H9N2 AIV) has caused significant losses to the poultry industry due to the high mortality associated with secondary infections attributable to E. coli. This study tries to address the underlying secondary mechanisms after H9N2 AIV infection. Initially, nine day-old specific pathogen-free chickens were assigned to control (uninfected) and H9N2-infected groups, respectively. Using Illumina sequencing, histological examination, and quantitative real-time PCR, it was found that H9N2 AIV caused intestinal microbiota disorder, injury, and inflammatory damage to the intestinal mucosa. Notably, the genera Escherichia, especially E. coli, significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) at five days post-infection (dpi), while Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and other probiotic organisms were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01). Simultaneously, the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin 3, and occludin), TFF2, and Muc2 were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01), indicating the destruction of the intestinal epithelial cell tight junctions and the damage of mucin layer construction. Moreover, the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-22, IFN-α, and IL-17A in intestinal epithelial cells were significantly upregulated, resulting in the inflammatory response and intestinal injury. Our findings may provide a theoretical basis for observed gastroenteritis-like symptoms such as diarrhea and secondary E. coli infection following H9N2 AIV infection.</jats:p>",0

Since July in 2015, an emerging infectious disease of Hepatitis-Hydropericardium 
syndrome (HHS) was prevalent in chicken flocks in China. To confirm the 
causative agent and investigate the epidemiology of the disease, a total of 38 
chicken flocks including 187 samples from Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Henan, 
Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Xinjiang, Shandong and Hunan provinces in China were 
collected and determined by PCR detection, sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and 
virus isolation. 81 samples (positive rate of samples, 81/187, 43.3%) 
distributed in 33 chicken flocks (positive rate of chicken flocks, 33/38, 86.8%) 
were detected to be positive for fowl adenovirus (FAdV) by PCR method, of which 
30 were determined as FAdV species C, 41 were species D, 9 were species E and 1 
was uncertain for the viral species by phylogenetic analysis, implicating that 
at least three species (C, D and E) of FAdVs were prevalent in China and the 
species C and D were predominantly the prevalent viral strains. Interestingly, 
our results indicated that two types of FAdVs (C and D) co-existed in one flock, 
resulting in complex condition for the prevalence of the disease. In addition, 
13 viral strains of FAdV-C were isolated from different geographic areas and one 
of the isolates from Henan province, designated HN/151025 strain, was inoculated 
into 40-day-old specific pathogen free chickens via intramuscular or oral route 
to evaluate the pathogenicity. It was found that 90% (9/10) chickens died in the 
intramuscular injection group and 30% (3/10) birds died in the oral route 
infection group after challenge. Histopathology examination displayed that the 
pathology confined to liver, kidney, spleen, and heart. These results indicated 
that the virus was a highly virulent strain.

Peste des petits ruminants viruses (PPRVs) re-emerged in China at the end of 
2013 and then spread rapidly into 22 provinces through movement of live goats 
and sheep. In this study, 96 samples of domestic animals and 13 samples of 
wildlife were analysed for the presence of PPRV infection by ELISA or RT-PCR. Of 
96 samples from sheep and goats, 91 were PPRV positive, whereas all of the 13 
samples from three wild species, Capra ibex (Capra ibex sibirica), argali (Ovis 
ammon) and Goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa), were found to be positive. 
Five wildlife-origin isolates from the above samples were identified as the 
lineage IV by a multiple alignment of the partial sequences in N gene.

Caprine parainfluenza virus type 3 (CPIV3) is a newly emerging pathogenic 
respiratory agent infecting both young and adult goats, and it was identified in 
eastern China in 2013. Cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be 
important modulators of the intricate virus-host interactions. In order to 
elucidate the role of miRNAs in madin-darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells during 
CPIV3 infection. In this study, we performed high-throughput sequencing 
technology to analyze small RNA libraries in CPIV3-infected and mock-infected 
MDBK cells. The results showed that a total of 249 known and 152 novel candidate 
miRNAs were differentially expressed in MDBK cells after CPIV3 infection, and 
22,981 and 22,572 target genes were predicted, respectively. In addition, 
RT-qPCR assay was used to further confirm the expression patterns of 13 of these 
differentially expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets. Functional annotation 
analysis showed these up- and downregulated target genes were mainly involved in 
MAPK signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling 
pathway, p53 signaling pathway, focal adhesion, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, 
and apoptosis, et al. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the 
comparative expression of miRNAs in MDBK cells after CPIV3 infection. Our 
finding provides information concerning miRNAs expression profile in response to 
CPIV3 infection, and offers clues for identifying potential candidates for 
antiviral therapies against CPIV3.

Sapoviruses (SaVs), belonging to the genus Sapovirus of the family 
Caliciviridae, were known as the enteric pathogen causing acute gastroenteritis. 
SaVs have been detected in humans and several animals including pigs and some 
porcine SaVs showed close sequence relationship with human strains suggesting 
the possibility of interspecies transmission. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 
two porcine SaVs (with strain names of p38 and SH1703) using the metagenomic 
analyses and traditional RT-PCR methods. Phylogenetic trees were constructed 
based on the complete genome, the full-length VP 1 nucleotide and amino acid 
sequences to group those two strains. The two porcine SaV strains, p38 and 
SH1703, detected in this study, were classified as genogroup III and genogroup 
VII, respectively. These two strains showed similar genomic organization with 
that of other SaVs. We firstly divided SaVs into 51 genotypes within 19 
genogroups. Our data are helpful for genetic characterization and classification 
of newly detected SaVs worldwide.

Faecal shedding of rotavirus vaccine in Chinese children after vaccination with Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine (LLR) is an oral live attenuated vaccine first licensed in China in 2000. To date, &gt; 60 million doses of LLR have been distributed to children. However, very little is known about faecal shedding of LLR in children. Therefore, faecal samples (n = 1,184) were collected from 114 children for 15 days post-vaccination in September–November 2011/2012. Faecal shedding and viral loads were determined by an enzyme immunoassay kit (EIA) and real-time RT-PCR. The complete genome was sequenced and the vaccine strain was isolated by culture in MA104 cells. Approximately 14.0% (16/114) of children had rotavirus-positive samples by EIA for at least 1 day post-vaccination. Viral loads in EIA-positive samples ranged from &lt; 1.0 × 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> to 1.9 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> copies/g. Faecal shedding occurred as early as post-vaccination day 2 and as late as post-vaccination day 13 and peaked on post-vaccination day 5–10. One LLR strain was isolated by culture in MA104 cells. Sequence analysis showed 99% identity with LLR prototype strain. Faecal shedding of LLR in stool is common within 15 days of LLR vaccination, indicating vaccine strains can replicate in human enteric tissues.</jats:p>",0

Egg-laying duck flocks in Guangdong province, southern China, have been 
suffering a widely spreading infectious disease with abrupt egg drops and death 
since the winter of 2010. However, the causative pathogen was not known. We 
obtained two independent virus isolates named FS and JM from the diseased layer 
duck flocks and identified them as duck-origin Tembusu virus by PCR detection, 
sequencing the entire length of the open reading frames (ORFs). The two isolates 
FS and JM shared high sequence similarity to the isolates of duck-origin Tembusu 
virus that was first emerged in eastern China in April 2010. Blast analysis 
shows that the whole ORF sequences of FS and JM have the highest similarity (>99 
%) to BYD-1(the first reported duck-origin Tembusu virus) and JS804 (the first 
reported goose-origin Tembusu virus), indicating that the full-length genomes 
were highly conserved in waterfowl-origin Tembusu viruses. The present study 
suggests that duck-origin Tembusu viruses have spread fast from eastern China to 
southern China, causing widely spreading infections. The high conservation of 
duck-origin Tembusu virus strains provides the genomic basis for choosing the 
strains for vaccine preparation for better protection against this new virus 
infection.

astrovirus. In a retrospective analysis of 32 cases of bovine encephalitides of 
unknown etiology, 3 other infected animals were detected by using PCR and in 
situ hybridization for viral RNA. Viral RNA was restricted to the nervous system 
and detected in the cytoplasm of affected neurons within the spinal cord, 
brainstem, and cerebellum. Microscopically, the lesions were of widespread 
neuronal necrosis, microgliosis, and perivascular cuffing preferentially 
distributed in gray matter and most severe in the cerebellum and brainstem, with 
increasing intensity caudally down the spinal cord. These results suggest that 
infection with BoAstV-NeuroS1 is a potential cause of neurologic disease in 
cattle.

Multiple Diverse Circoviruses Infect Farm Animals and Are Commonly Found in Human and Chimpanzee Feces,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Circoviruses are known to infect birds and pigs and can cause a wide range of severe symptoms with significant economic impact. Using viral metagenomics, we identified circovirus-like DNA sequences and characterized 15 circular viral DNA genomes in stool samples from humans in Pakistan, Nigeria, Tunisia, and the United States and from wild chimpanzees. Distinct genomic features and phylogenetic analysis indicate that some viral genomes were part of a previously unrecognized genus in the
            <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>
            family we tentatively named “
            <jats:italic>Cyclovirus</jats:italic>
            ” whose genetic diversity is comparable to that of all the known species in the
            <jats:italic>Circovirus</jats:italic>
            genus.
            <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>
            detection in the stools of U.S. adults was limited to porcine circoviruses which were also found in most U.S. pork products. To determine whether the divergent cycloviruses found in non-U.S. human stools were of dietary origin, we genetically compared them to the cycloviruses in muscle tissue samples of commonly eaten farm animals in Pakistan and Nigeria. Limited genetic overlap between cycloviruses in human stool samples and local cow, goat, sheep, camel, and chicken meat samples indicated that the majority of the 25
            <jats:italic>Cyclovirus</jats:italic>
            species identified might be human viruses. We show that the genetic diversity of small circular DNA viral genomes in various mammals, including humans, is significantly larger than previously recognized, and frequent exposure through meat consumption and contact with animal or human feces provides ample opportunities for cyclovirus transmission. Determining the role of cycloviruses, found in 7 to 17% of non-U.S. human stools and 3 to 55% of non-U.S. meat samples tested, in both human and animal diseases is now facilitated by knowledge of their genomes.

We characterized the genome of a highly divergent gyrovirus (GyV8) in the spleen 
and uropygial gland tissues of a diseased northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), 
a pelagic bird beached in San Francisco, California. No other exogenous viral 
sequences could be identified using viral metagenomics. The small circular DNA 
genome shared no significant nucleotide sequence identity, and only 38-42 % 
amino acid sequence identity in VP1, with any of the previously identified 
gyroviruses. GyV8 is the first member of the third major phylogenetic clade of 
this viral genus and the first gyrovirus detected in an avian species other than 
chicken.

Bat Guano Virome: Predominance of Dietary Viruses from Insects and Plants plus Novel Mammalian Viruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bats are hosts to a variety of viruses capable of zoonotic transmissions. Because of increased contact between bats, humans, and other animal species, the possibility exists for further cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks. We describe here full and partial viral genomes identified using metagenomics in the guano of bats from California and Texas. A total of 34% and 58% of 390,000 sequence reads from bat guano in California and Texas, respectively, were related to eukaryotic viruses, and the largest proportion of those infect insects, reflecting the diet of these insectivorous bats, including members of the viral families
            <jats:italic>Dicistroviridae</jats:italic>

            and the subfamily
            <jats:italic>Densovirinae</jats:italic>
            . The second largest proportion of virus-related sequences infects plants and fungi, likely reflecting the diet of ingested insects, including members of the viral families

            ,

            and the genus
            <jats:italic>Sobemovirus</jats:italic>
            . Bat guano viruses related to those infecting mammals comprised the third largest group, including members of the viral families

            . No close relative of known human viral pathogens was identified in these bat populations. Phylogenetic analysis was used to clarify the relationship to known viral taxa of novel sequences detected in bat guano samples, showing that some guano viral sequences fall outside existing taxonomic groups. This initial characterization of the bat guano virome, the first metagenomic analysis of viruses in wild mammals using second-generation sequencing, therefore showed the presence of previously unidentified viral species, genera, and possibly families. Viral metagenomics is a useful tool for genetically characterizing viruses present in animals with the known capability of direct or indirect viral zoonosis to humans.

Twenty-seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated 
from dead or diseased chickens at different chicken farms in South China during 
2004-2008, of which the S1 gene was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 
gene sequences of the isolated 27 strains together with 29 strains published in 
Genbank revealed that all IBV strains except for one isolated and one published 
were clustered into six distinct genotypes I-VI. 26 isolated strains belong to 
genotypes I, II, and III, forming a big phylogenetic branch without new 
predominant strains, whereas all five vaccine strains belong to genotype V that 
is evolutionarily distant from genotypes I, II, and III. The study of the 
protease cleavage motif within the S1 protein found 12 different cleavage 
motifs, of which 3 motifs are shared by both isolated and published strains, 2 
motifs unique to isolated strains, and 7 motifs unique to published strains, 
further bolstering the notion of no new predominant strains. Alignment analysis 
of the S1 amino acid sequences indicated that the amino acid substitutions, 
insertions, and deletions are polymorphic and diverse, showing no sign of 
predominant genetic changes among the isolated strains. Taken together, there 
was no predominant new strain circulating in South China during 2004-2008. 
Nonetheless, circulating IBV strains have been continuously evolving with 
genetic compositions distant from vaccine strains; this explains why there have 
been constant but infrequent outbreaks in commercial flocks in South China 
during 2004-2008. Furthermore, in order to safe guard against the sudden 
emergence of new predominant strains, continuing surveillance of IBV strains 
circulating in the field is of extreme importance.

Viruses in diarrhoeic dogs include novel kobuviruses and sapoviruses,"<jats:p>The close interactions of dogs with humans and surrounding wildlife provide frequent opportunities for cross-species virus transmissions. In order to initiate an unbiased characterization of the eukaryotic viruses in the gut of dogs, this study used deep sequencing of partially purified viral capsid-protected nucleic acids from the faeces of 18 diarrhoeic dogs. Known canine parvoviruses, coronaviruses and rotaviruses were identified, and the genomes of the first reported canine kobuvirus and sapovirus were characterized. Canine kobuvirus, the first sequenced canine picornavirus and the closest genetic relative of the diarrhoea-causing human Aichi virus, was detected at high frequency in the faeces of both healthy and diarrhoeic dogs. Canine sapovirus constituted a novel genogroup within the genus<jats:italic>Sapovirus</jats:italic>, a group of viruses also associated with human and animal diarrhoea. These results highlight the high frequency of new virus detection possible even in extensively studied animal species using metagenomics approaches, and provide viral genomes for further disease-association studies.</jats:p>",0

H5N6 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and a zoonotic disease that 
causes recurring endemics in East Asia. At least 155 H5N6 outbreaks, including 
15 human infections, have been reported in China. These repeated outbreaks have 
increased concern that the H5N6 virus may cross over to humans and cause a 
pandemic. In February, 2016, peafowls in a breeding farm exhibited a highly 
contagious disease. Post-mortem examinations, including RT-PCR, and virus 
isolation, confirmed that the highly pathogenic H5N6 influenza virus was the 
causative agent, and the strain was named A/Pavo Cristatus/Jiangxi/JA1/2016. In 
animal experiments, it exhibited high pathogenicity in chickens and an estimated 
median lethal dose in mice of ~104.3 TCID50. A phylogenetic analysis showed that 
JA1/2016 was clustered in H5 clade 2.3.4.4. FG594-like H5N6 virus from Guangdong 
Province was the probable predecessor of JA1/2016, and the estimated divergence 
time was June 2014. Furthermore, we found that H5N6 influenza viruses can be 
classified into the two following groups: Group 1 and Group 2. Group 2 influenza 
viruses have not been detected since the end of 2014, whereas Group 1 influenza 
viruses have continually evolved and reassorted with the ""gene pool"" circulating 
in south China, resulting in the rise of novel subtypes of this influenza virus. 
An increase in the number of its identified hosts, the expanding range of its 
distribution, and the continual evolution of H5N6 AIVs enhance the risk that an 
H5N6 virus may spread to other continents and cause a pandemic.

Short beak and dwarfism syndrome (SBDS) has been constantly breaking out in 
China since 2015. It is caused by a novel goose parvovirus-related virus (NGPV) 
and can severely restrict the growth of ducks. In this study, seven NGPV stains 
were isolated from different regions in China between 2015 and 2016. To better 
understand the correlation between NGPV and goose parvovirus (GPV), we conducted 
complete genome sequencing and a comprehensive analysis of the NGPV genome. The 
phylogenetic and alignment analysis showed that NGPV is a branch of GPV, sharing 
92.2%-97.1% nucleotide identity with GPV. Compared with classical GPV, five 
consensus nucleotide mutations in all the seven NGPV isolates and two 
14-nucleotide-pair deletions in six NGPV isolates were found in the inverted 
terminal repeats, twelve and eight synchronous amino acid changes were found in 
the replication protein and capsid protein of NGPV, respectively, which might be 
important for viral gene regulation, humoral immune responses, and host 
transfer. Notably, SDLY1602 was demonstrated a recombinant strain, with the 
potential major parent GPV vaccine strain 82-0321v and the minor parent GPV wild 
strain GDaGPV. This is the first report showing that the recombination between 
two classical GPV strains generated a NGPV strain circulating in nature. This 
study will advance our understanding of NGPV molecular biology and facilitate to 
elucidate the evolutionary characteristics of GPV.

A high throughput screening scheme is often a prerequisite for directed 
evolution of enzymes or metagenomic analysis of DNA samples. For assaying 
intracellular enzymes of interest (e.g. when Escherichia coli is used), it 
requires cell lysis in many cases, chemical or enzymatic, which can be tedious 
and cost-consuming. In this study, a set of UV-inducible autolytic vectors was 
constructed to offer a simpler means of cell lysis that is free of additional 
liquid handling. The SRRz lysis gene cassette from bacteriophage Lambda was 
cloned downstream of a UV-inducible promoter, the recA promoter or the umuDC 
promoter, and further inserted into the backbone of pUC18, and transformed into 
E. coli BL21 cells. The SRRz expression and cell lysis was induced by UV 
irradiation. For both the recA and umuDC promoters, at 30 degrees C the lysis 
efficiency was found to be consistent and above 60% as measured using 
beta-galactosidase as the reporter. However, at 37 degrees C the lysis profiles 
were found to be erratic. UV lysis in 96-well plates also produced consistent 
lysis results that were comparable to those obtained by lysozyme treatment, 
demonstrating the utility of these autolytic vectors in high throughput 
screening. This set of artificial SRRz autolysis units should be transferable to 
other vectors. Surprisingly, it was found that the E. coli BL21(DE3) was also 
partially disrupted under UV irradiation, with a lysis efficiency of 44.5% at 30 
degrees C, and 22.5% at 37 degrees C.

The genome of a novel classical swine fever virus (CSFV), SWH/CA/2004, isolated 
from a hog pen in Henan Province, central China, is 12,296 nucleotides (nt) in 
length. It is composed of a 373-nt 5' terminal non-translated region (NTR), a 
11,697-nt open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of 3,898 amino acids 
(aa), and a 226-nt 3'-NTR. Genome comparison of the SWH/CA/2004 isolate (GenBank 
Accession: DQ127910) with other known CSFV isolates was performed and analyzed. 
Corresponding segments from SWH/CA/2004 and other reported strains shared 
80.4-99.8% identity at the nucleotide level and 89.5-99.8% identity at the amino 
acid level. From an evolutionary point of view, isolate SWH/CA/2004 is closely 
related to the highly virulent isolate cF114/CA/2001, with a pairwise distance 
of 0.013; and distantly related to the moderately virulent isolate 
GXWZ02/CA/2003, with pairwise distance 0.170. The phylogenetic trees of the 
full-length genome and the following region E(rns), E1, E2, and NS5B-based 
neighbor-joining (NJ) method were constructed and approximately divided into 
different genetic groups according to avirulence, moderate virulence and high 
virulence, while other region-based NJ trees demonstrated sequence conservation 
between these groups. The four genomic regions may constitute important criteria 
for genetic typing of diverse CSFV isolates. Based on these analyses, isolate 
SWH/CA/2004 was deduced to belong to the highly virulent isolate group. However, 
SWH/CA/2004 also contains a 14-U deletion in the 3'-NTR that is characteristic 
of avirulent isolates. These analyses constitute a comprehensive study of the 
phylogenetics of CSF based on distinct regions of the genome and may provide the 
basis for future molecular epidemiology research to identify virulent strain 
outbreaks and trigger implementation of appropriate control measures.

BACKGROUND: Porcine parvovirus (PPV), a member of the Parvoviridae family, 
causes great economic loss in the swine industry worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 
are a class of non-protein-coding genes that play many diverse and complex roles 
in viral infections.
FINDING: Aiming to determine the impact of PPV infections on the cellular 
miRNAome, we used high-throughput sequencing to sequence two miRNA libraries 
prepared from porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) cells under normal conditions and during 
PPV infection. There was differential miRNA expression between the uninfected 
and infected cells: 65 miRNAs were upregulated and 128 miRNAs were 
downregulated. We detected the expression of miR-10b, miR-20a, miR-19b, 
miR-181a, miR-146b, miR-18a, and other previously identified immune-related 
miRNAs. Gene Ontology analysis and KEGG function annotations of the host target 
genes suggested that the miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, 
including cellular metabolic processes, immune system processes, and gene 
expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a large group of miRNAs is expressed in 
PK-15 cells and that some miRNAs were altered in PPV-infected PK-15 cells. A 
number of microRNAs play an important role in regulating immune-related gene 
expression. Our findings should help with the development of new control 
strategies to prevent or treat PPV infections in swine.

1997 and 2006. In order to understand their genomic characteristics, the 
full-length genome of S1 and SY0608 isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The 
results indicated that their genome composition differed significantly and 
shared only 88.5% nucleotide identity with each other. The genetic variation and 
amino acid substitutions were not randomly distributed in the genome, and mainly 
focused on ORF1a, ORF3 and ORF5. The SY0608 strain, with high pathogenicity, had 
a 30-amino-acid deletion at amino acid positions 480 and 532-560 in comparison 
with the S1 strain. The alignment of amino acid sequence of Nsp1-Nsp8, GP2-GP5, 
M and N of S1 and SY0608 with other PRRSV isolates demonstrated that variation 
was mainly found in the Nsp2, GP3 and GP5 proteins. In comparison with the S1 
strain, the SY0608 strain showed some potential glycosylation site mutations in 
GP5 at amino acid positions between 26 and 39, which might be associated with 
viral antigenicity. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two strains belonged 
to two different branches that do not indicate differences in pathogenicity. 
Interestingly, the deletion strains isolated recently in China formed a new 
minor branch, revealing the same evolutionary trend.

Getah virus (GETV) was first isolated in Malaysia in 1955. Since then, epidemics 
in horses and pigs caused by GETV have resulted in huge economic losses. At 
present, GETV has spread across Eurasia and Southeast Asia, including mainland 
China, Korea, Japan, Mongolia, and Russia. Data show that the Most Recent Common 
Ancestor (MRCA) of GETV existed about 145years ago (95% HPD: 75-244) and 
gradually evolved into four distinct evolutionary populations: Groups I-IV. The 
MRCA of GETVs in Group III, which includes all GETVs isolated from mosquitoes, 
pigs, horses, and other animals since the 1960s (from latitude 19°N to 60°N), 
existed about 51years ago (95% HPD: 51-72). Group III is responsible for most 
viral epidemics among domestic animals. An analysis of the GETV E2 protein 
sequence and structure revealed seven common amino acid mutation sites. These 
sites are responsible for the structural and electrostatic differences detected 
between widespread Group III isolates and the prototype strain MM2021. These 
differences may account for the recent geographical radiation of the virus. 
Considering the economic significance of GETV infection in pigs and horses, we 
recommend the implementation of strict viral screening and monitoring programs.

MicroRNA-23b Promotes Avian Leukosis Virus Subgroup J (ALV-J) Replication by Targeting IRF1,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) can cause several different leukemia-like proliferative diseases in the hemopoietic system of chickens. Here, we investigated the transcriptome profiles and miRNA expression profiles of ALV-J-infected and uninfected chicken spleens to identify the genes and miRNAs related to ALV-J invasion. In total, 252 genes and 167 miRNAs were differentially expressed in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to control uninfected spleens. miR-23b expression was up-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared with the control spleens and transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (<jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic>) was down-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to uninfected spleens. A dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic> was a direct target of miR-23b. miR-23b overexpression significantly (P = 0.0022) decreased <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic> mRNA levels and repressed IRF1-3′-UTR reporter activity. <jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic> experiments revealed that miR-23b overexpression strengthened ALV-J replication, whereas miR-23b loss of function inhibited ALV-J replication. <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic> overexpression inhibited ALV-J replication and <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic> knockdown enhanced ALV-J replication. Moreover, <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic> overexpression significantly (P = 0.0014) increased <jats:italic>IFN-β</jats:italic> expression. In conclusion, these results suggested that miR-23b may play an important role in ALV-J replication by targeting <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0
MicroRNAs in the immune organs of chickens and ducks indicate divergence of immunity against H5N1 avian influenza,"<jats:p>Chickens are susceptible to the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus (HPAIV), whereas ducks are not. Here, we used high‐throughput sequencing to analyse the microRNA expression in the spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius of H5N1‐HPAIV‐infected and non‐infected chickens and ducks. We annotated the genomic positions of duck microRNAs and we compared the microRNA repertoires of chickens and ducks. Our results showed that the microRNA expression patterns in the homologous immune organs of specific‐pathogen‐free (SPF) chickens and ducks diverge substantially. Moreover, there was larger divergence between the microRNA expression patterns in immune organs of HPAIV‐infected chickens than HPAIV‐infected ducks. Together, our results might help to elucidate the roles of microRNAs in the divergent immunity of chickens and ducks against H5N1 HPAIV.</jats:p>",0

For decades, French guinea fowl have been affected by fulminating enteritis of 
unclear origin. By using metagenomics, we identified a novel avian 
gammacoronavirus associated with this disease that is distantly related to 
turkey coronaviruses. Fatal respiratory diseases in humans have recently been 
caused by coronaviruses of animal origin.

Twelve Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains were isolated from chickens 
involved in outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND) in western China (Shaanxi, 
Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai and Guangxi provinces) between 1979 and 1999. All 
strains were determined to be velogenic by plaque formation, the mean death time 
(MDT) of embryonated eggs, and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI). For 
preparation of virus RNA, the acid guanidinium-thiocyanate method was used. A 
908bp fragment of nucleotide was amplified by RT-PCR starting from the N 
terminal of the F gene and the PCR segments were cloned into the PGEM-T vector 
and sequenced. The similarities of the nucleotide sequences (1-519bp) and 
predicted amino acid sequences of the F gene (1-125) were analyzed by comparing 
the 12 NDV isolates with the NDV vaccine strains Lasota, B1, H1 and V4, with 
classical NDV strains and recent epizootic strains. Phylogenetic analysis 
demonstrated that all strains were of two novel genotypes; the NDV strains that 
caused the outbreak of ND in western China during 1998-1999 was of the genotype 
VIIa, whereas the strains from the Qinghai province (1979-1985) were of genotype 
VIII, which has been found predominately in southern Africa.

A serologic subgroup of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) has not been identified, 
whereas genetic diversity among BLVs has been reported by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). To investigate 
the distribution of BLV provirus variants, 42 isolates from Argentina and Japan 
were examined by nested PCR for a segment of the env gene, followed by DNA 
sequencing. The nucleotide sequences were compared with other previously 
characterized BLV variants from different geographical areas (Belgium, France, 
Italy, North America, Australia, Japan and Argentina). The majority of analyzed 
segments had a tendency for nucleotide substitution without changing the amino 
acid. The constructed phylogenetic tree showed the relations and differences 
between proviruses and within each one. Most of the samples in Argentina formed 
one cluster. The samples in Japan, except one, also formed one cluster and some 
of them showed high homology with the isolates from Australia and the USA. 
Considering the sequence analysis of env PCR products of all Japanese and 
Argentine samples and comparing them with the other previously isolated 
sequences, the variation was up to 3.5% and was characterized geographically in 
each area.

Isolates of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) from chicken cases were obtained from 
various locations in Taiwan during 2003-2006 and were genotypically analyzed by 
using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with primers 
specific to the viral fusion (F) protein gene (534 bp). Part of the amplified F 
protein DNA product (nucleotide sequence 47-418) and the deduced amino acid 
sequences were compared phylogenetically with those from strains previously 
reported in Taiwan and other geographic regions. Our results showed that all 
Taiwanese isolates (n=20) collected during 2003-2006, according to the 
phylogenetic tree, belong to the genotype VIId. In addition, all the six 
Taiwanese isolates obtained in 2003, carry the motif (112)R-R-Q-K-R(116) and 
have the amino acid L(23) replaced by F(23) (assigned as Group 1). On the other 
hand, 12 out of the 14 Taiwanese isolates obtained during 2004-2006 possess the 
motif (112)R-R-K-K-R(116) and have the amino acid G(74), instead of E(74) 
(assigned as Group 2). To our best knowledge, this is the first reported VIId 
isolates that possess the sequences of G(74)/(112)R-R-K-K-R(116) within the F0 
protein. Since a high mortality, severe clinical signs, typical postmortem 
lesions, and a high intra-cerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) were observed in 
the NDV-infected chickens, these isolates acquired between 2003 and 2006 are 
considered as the velogenic type. The Group 2 viruses have become dominant and 
responsible for the majority of Taiwanese outbreaks during recent years. Based 
on our phylogenetic analysis, it can be postulated that these isolates were 
evolved from previously reported local strains, and the Group 2 family emerged 
the latest in the genotype VIId. The information is fundamental to improving the 
efficiency of controlling strategies and vaccine development for NDV.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections cause great economic losses to the 
poultry industry worldwide, and the emergence of new variant strains complicates 
disease control. The present study investigated the genetic and protectotypic 
features of newly emerged Korean IBV strains. A phylogenetic analysis showed 
that several recent isolates formed 2 different clusters (new cluster 1 and 2), 
which were distinct from other preexisting clusters. New cluster 1 IBV strains 
represented recombinants between Korean nephropathogenic strain KM91 and the 
QXIBV strain. New cluster 2 IBV strains showed low amino acid homology (<58.7%) 
compared with previous isolates. We evaluated the protective efficacy of 
commercial IBV vaccines (H120 and K2 strain) against these new isolates. In 
cross-protection studies, the H120 strain did not provide sufficient protection 
against these variants. However, highly attenuated nephropathogenic IBV vaccine, 
K2 strain, provided significantly higher levels of protection against variants 
compared with chickens vaccinated with H120 (P < 0.05 or better). These results 
indicate that the K2 vaccine could be helpful for the reduction of economic 
losses caused by newly evolving IBV recombinants (new cluster 1) and variants 
(new cluster 2).

This study is focused on the identification of the faecal virome of healthy 
chickens raised in high-density, export-driven poultry farms in Brazil. 
Following high-throughput sequencing, a total of 7743 de novo-assembled contigs 
were constructed and compared with known nucleotide/amino acid sequences from 
the GenBank database. Analyses with blastx revealed that 279 contigs (4 %) were 
related to sequences of eukaryotic viruses. Viral genome sequences (total or 
partial) indicative of members of recognized viral families, including 
Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, 
Picornaviridae and Reoviridae, were identified, some of those representing novel 
genotypes. In addition, a range of circular replication-associated protein 
encoding DNA viruses were also identified. The characterization of the faecal 
virome of healthy chickens described here not only provides a description of the 
viruses encountered in such niche but should also represent a baseline for 
future studies comparing viral populations in healthy and diseased chicken 
flocks. Moreover, it may also be relevant for human health, since chickens 
represent a significant proportion of the animal protein consumed worldwide.

Malabsorption syndrome (MAS) is an economically important disease of young, 
commercially reared broilers, characterized by growth retardation, defective 
feather development and diarrheic faeces. Several viruses have been tentatively 
associated to such syndrome. Here, in order to examine potential associations 
between enteric viruses and MAS, the faecal viromes of 70 stool samples 
collected from diseased (n = 35) and healthy (n = 35) chickens from seven flocks 
were characterized and compared. Following high-throughput sequencing, a total 
of 8,347,319 paired end reads, with an average of 231 nt, were generated. 
Through analysis of de novo assembled contigs, 144 contigs > 1000 nt were 
identified with hits to eukaryotic viral sequences, as determined by GenBank 
database. A number of known and unknown representatives of Adenoviridae, 
Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, 
Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae, as well as novel 
uncharacterized CRESS-DNA viruses, were identified. However, the distribution of 
sequence reads of viral genomes identified in diseased or healthy birds revealed 
no statistically significant differences. These findings indicate no association 
between the occurrence of MAS and enteric viruses. The viral genomes reported in 
the present study, including a variety of novel viruses, seem part of the normal 
intestinal microbiota of chickens.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects a range of species, including 
humans, pigs, wild boars and deer. Zoonotic transmission may contribute to the 
high HEV seroprevalence in the human population of many countries. A novel 
divergent HEV from moose (Alces alces) in Sweden was recently identified by 
partial genome sequencing. Since only one strain was found, its classification 
within the HEV family, prevalence in moose and zoonotic potential was unclear. 
We therefore investigated samples from 231 moose in seven Swedish counties for 
HEV, and sequenced a near complete moose HEV genome. Phylogenetic analysis to 
classify this virus within the family Hepeviridae and to explore potential host 
specific determinants was performed.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The HEV prevalence of moose was determined by PCR (marker 
for active infection) and serological assays (marker of past infection) of sera 
and 51 fecal samples from 231 Swedish moose. Markers of active and past 
infection were found in 67 (29%) animals, while 34 (15%) were positive for HEV 
RNA, 43 (19%) were seropositive for anti-HEV antibodies, and 10 (4%) had both 
markers. The number of young individuals positive for HEV RNA was larger than 
for older individuals, and the number of anti-HEV antibody positive individuals 
increased with age. The high throughput sequenced moose HEV genome was 35-60% 
identical to existing HEVs. Partial ORF1 sequences from 13 moose strains showed 
high similarity among them, forming a distinct monophyletic clade with a common 
ancestor to HEV genotype 1-6 group, which includes members known for zoonotic 
transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a high frequency of HEV in moose in Sweden, 
with markers of current and past infection demonstrated in 30% of the animals. 
Moose is thus an important animal reservoir of HEV. The phylogenetic 
relationship demonstrated that the moose HEV belonged to the genotype 1-6 group, 
which includes strains that also infect humans, and therefore may signify a 
potential for zoonotic transmission of this HEV.

Evidence from nature: interspecies spread of heron hepatitis B viruses,"<jats:p>Heron hepatitis B viruses (HHBVs) in three subspecies of free-living great blue herons (<jats:italic>Ardea herodias</jats:italic>) from Florida, USA, were identified and characterized. Eight of 13 samples were positive in all assays used, whereas sera from egrets, which are also members of the family Ardeidae, were negative in the same assays. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of viral DNA sequences from the preS/S region of previously reported and novel HHBV strains isolated from captive grey herons (Germany) and free-ranging great blue herons (USA), respectively, revealed a strong conservation (95 % sequence similarity) with two separate clusters, implying a common ancestor of all strains. Our data demonstrate for the first time that different subspecies of herons are infected by HHBV and that these infections exist in non-captive birds. Phylogenetic analysis and the fact that the different heron species are geographically isolated populations suggest that lateral transmission, virus adaptation and environmental factors all play a role in HHBV spreading and evolution.</jats:p>",0

Members of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) cause various diseases 
associated with tumor formation and decreased fertility, resulting in major 
economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. To assess the status of ALV-J 
infection in meat-type chickens in southern China, the molecular epidemiology of 
ALV-J strains was investigated. A total of 265 clinical samples collected from 
southern China from 2013 to 2014 were investigated in this study for the 
presence of ALV-J, which resulted in 12 virus isolates. Phylogenetic analysis 
showed that 91.7 % (11/12) of the ALV-J isolates have possessed high homology to 
Chinese layer isolates and belong to one subgroup. One of the ALV isolates 
(designated GD1411-1) was relatively closely related to the ALV-J broiler 
isolates, indicating that the GD1411-1 isolate might be a transition strain. 
Several unique nucleotide substitutions in gp85 and the U3 region were detected 
in all 12 ALV-J isolates. This study provides some interesting information on 
the molecular characterization of ALV-J isolates. These findings will be 
beneficial for understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of ALV-J infection.

The newly emerging canine influenza virus (CIV) causes considerable concerns for 
both veterinary and public health. During 2009-2010, six strains of H3N2 
influenza virus were isolated from dogs in Jiangsu Province, China. Sequence and 
phylogenetic analysis of eight gene segments revealed that the six viruses were 
most similar to a recent canine-derived subtype H3N2 influenza virus isolated in 
cats from South Korea, which originated from avian strain. By comparing the 
deduced amino acid sequences of the hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) and neuraminidase (NA) 
genes of the six Jiangsu isolates against the most similar avian strains, we 
found that all isolates had several common mutations at the receptor-binding 
sites, potential glycosylation sites and cleavage site in HA1, and antigenic 
sites in both the HA1 and NA segments. Significantly, a unique two amino acid 
insertion in the NA stalk was found. Experimental infection of BALB/c mice 
revealed that viral RNA could be detected in the major rodent organs, such as 
brain, heart, spleen, kidney, liver and intestine, as well as the lung. All the 
sampled organs from infected mice showed significant lesions and viral antigen 
staining. This study highlights the potential of domesticated animals to become 
a reservoir for influenza virus and the need for surveillance programs to detect 
cross-species transmission.

"Hypothesis On The Source, Transmission and Characteristics of Infection of Avian Influenza A (H7N9) Virus – Based On Analysis of Field Epidemiological Investigation and Gene Sequence Analysis","<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>On 31 March 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission announced that human infections with influenza A (H7N9) virus had occurred in Shanghai and Anhui provinces, China. H7N9 cases were later detected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It was estimated that the virus first spread northward along the route taken by migratory birds and then spread to neighbouring provinces with the sale of poultry. Epidemiological studies were carried out on samples from the external environment of infected cases, transmission routes, farmers markets and live poultry markets. Phylogenetic study of viral sequences from human and avian infections in Zhejiang showed that those from Shanghai and Jiangsu provinces along Taihu Lake were highly homologous with those from the external environment. This suggests that avian viruses carried by waterfowl combined with the virus carried by migratory birds, giving rise to avian influenza virus H7N9, which is highly pathogenic to humans. It is possible that the virus was transmitted by local wildfowl to domestic poultry and then to humans, or spread further by means of trading in wholesale poultry markets. As the weather has turned warm, and with measures adopted to terminate poultry trade and facilitate health communication, the epidemic in the first half of the year has been kept under control. However, the infection source in the triangular area around Taihu Lake still remains. The H7N9 epidemic will probably hit the area later in the year and next spring when the migratory birds return and may even spread to other areas. Great importance should therefore be attached to the wildfowl in Taihu Lake as the repository and disseminator of the virus: investigation and study of this population is essential.</jats:p>",0

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) affects infant and young children. A viral 
metagenomic approach was used to identify the eukaryotic viruses in fecal 
samples from 29 Thai children with clinical diagnosis of HFMD collected during 
the 2012 outbreak. These children had previously tested negative by PCR for 
enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 and A6. Deep sequencing revealed nine 
virus families: Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Parvoviridae, Caliciviridae, 
Paramyxoviridae, Adenoviridae, Reoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Polyomaviridae. 
The highest number of viral sequences belonged to human rhinovirus C, 
astrovirus-MLB2, and coxsackievirus A21. Our study provides an overview of virus 
community and highlights a broad diversity of viruses found in feces from 
children with HFMD.

The field of virus discovery has burgeoned with the advent of high throughput 
sequencing platforms and bioinformatics programs that enable rapid 
identification and molecular characterization of known and novel agents, 
investments in global microbial surveillance that include wildlife and domestic 
animals as well as humans, and recognition that viruses may be implicated in 
chronic as well as acute diseases. Here we review methods for viral surveillance 
and discovery, strategies and pitfalls in linking discoveries to disease, and 
identify opportunities for improvements in sequencing instrumentation and 
analysis, the use of social media and medical informatics that will further 
advance clinical medicine and public health.

BACKGROUND: Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) can cause neurologic disease in young 
pigs, respiratory disease in older pigs and abortion or birth of mummified 
fetuses or stillborn neonates. The re-emergence of Aujeszky's disease (AD) in 
pig farms vaccinated with live vaccine (Bartha-K61) caused substantial economic 
losses to Chinese pig industry since late 2011. A field ADV, named Qihe547, was 
isolated from pigs that exhibited suspected AD clinical symptoms. To better 
understand the genetic characteristics and mutations of Qihe547 ADV, the whole 
genome was sequenced and analyzed.
RESULTS: The genomic length of Qihe547 ADV was 143,404 bp, with 73.59% G + C 
contents. Phylogenetic analysis based on the whole genome of ADV strains 
revealed that Chinese ADV strains were located to one group with three 
subgroups. Qihe547 ADV was closely related to these novel ADV strains isolated 
in China since 2012. Qihe547 presented numerous hypervariable regions compared 
with oversea ADV strains. In 34 genes of Qihe547 ADV, amino acid (AA) insertion 
or deletion were observed. In addition, numerous AA mutations were found in the 
main protective antigen genes (gB, gC and gD genes). The differences of 
potential antigenic peptides in the main protective antigens between Qihe547 ADV 
and ADV Bartha were discovered in the dominant antigenic regions of gB 
(AA59-AA126, AA507-AA734),the extracellular region of gC and gD.
CONCLUSION: High diversity was observed between Qihe547 and foreign ADV 
isolates. The AA variations and the differences of potential antigenic peptides 
in the important functional regions of the main protective antigen (gB, gC and 
gD) of ADV Qihe547 may contribute to immune evasion of the virus and may be 
partial reason that the virus escapes from the vaccination of Bartha-K61 
vaccine. In a word, the effect of the variations obviously requires further 
research.

Three highly pathogenic H5N5 avian influenza viruses (HPAI), 
A/duck/Guangdong/wy11/2008 (WY11), A/duck/Guangdong/wy19/2008 (WY19), and 
A/duck/Guangdong/wy24/2008 (WY24) were isolated from ducks in southern China in 
April 2008. Here, we characterized these viruses by performing sequencing and 
phylogenetic analyses of their viral genes, assessing their virulence in ducks 
and mice, and performing cross-protection experiments in chickens. Sequence 
analysis revealed that the HA genes of these H5N5 viruses showed 97.1-97.8% 
homology to A/wild duck/Hunan/211/2005 (H5N1) influenza virus and that their NA 
genes showed 96.4-96.8% nucleotide identity to the NA gene of 
A/duck/Hunan/5613/2003 (H6N5) influenza virus, which belongs to the Eurasian 
lineage. Genotypic analysis indicated that these H5N5 viruses were multiple 
reassortants among H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, and H6N5 viruses. The analysis of HA clade 
showed that these H5N5 viruses are clustering into clade 2.3.4. In animal 
experiments, these H5N5 viruses caused 50% mortality in ducks and 100% mortality 
in chickens. In cross-protection experiments, the clade 2.3.2 avian influenza 
vaccine could provide only 75% protection with chickens against H5N5 virus 
challenge. Moreover, the H5N5 virus replicated efficiently in the lungs of mice, 
which suggested that the H5N5 viruses have the potential to infect mammalian 
hosts. Since ducks have served as reassortant vessels, playing pivotal roles in 
the generation of new subtypes of influenza viruses, it is important to monitor 
the emergence of this novel subtype of influenza viruses in waterfowl to 
understand their ecology and evolution and to control the spread of new viruses.

Peste des petits ruminants and cystic hydatidosis may be simultaneously endemic 
in a given area. Their pathogens are small ruminant morbillivirus (SRMV) and 
Echinococcus granulosus (E. granulosus), respectively. The SRMV, formerly called 
peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV), is classified into the genus 
Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. This virus is an ideal vaccine 
vector to deliver immunogenic proteins. In this study, a reverse genetics system 
was developed to rescue a recombinant SRMV (Nigeria 75/1 strain) expressing E. 
granulosus EG95 antigen in vitro. The recombinant SRMV, albeit replicating more 
slowly than its parental virus, could effectively express the EG95 antigen in 
cells by analyses of Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence and mass 
spectrometry. An EG95 subunit vaccine has been widely used for prevention of 
cystic hydatidosis in some areas of China. The EG95-expressing SRMV, if proven 
to induce effective immune responses against both diseases in a future animal 
experiment, would become a potential candidate of bivalent vaccine.

Small ruminant morbillivirus (SRMV), formerly called peste-des-petits-ruminants 
virus (PPRV), is classified into the genus Morbillivirus in the family 
Paramyxoviridae. If genetically modified using reverse genetics, the SRMV would 
be a useful vector to express foreign proteins in vitro and in vivo. In this 
study, a recombinant SRMV was rescued by reverse genetics for efficiently 
expressing an enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (eGFP) in vitro. Based on green 
fluorescence-tracked characteristics of the recombinant SRMV, eight mammalian 
cell lines (BHK-21, F81, MDBK, RK13, MDCK, PK15, Vero and GT) were selected for 
identifying their susceptibilities to SRMV infection. The result showed that all 
cell lines could be infected with the recombinant SRMV but at different 
efficiencies. The Vero and PK15 cell lines showed the highest and lowest 
susceptibilities to its infection, respectively, if merely comparing the 
proportions of green fluorescence-emitting cells among eight cell monolayers.

Pseudorabies (PR) is one of the most devastating diseases in the pig industry. 
To identify changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression and post-transcriptional 
regulatory responses to PRV infection in porcine kidney epithelial (PK15) cells, 
we sequenced a small RNA (sRNA) library prepared from infected PK15 cells and 
compared it to a library prepared from uninfected cells using Illumina deep 
sequencing. Here we found 25 novel viral miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing 
and 20 of these miRNAs were confirmed through stem-loop RT-qPCR. Intriguingly, 
unlike the usual miRNAs encoded by the α-herpesviruses, which are found 
clustered in the large latency transcript (LLT), these novel viral miRNAs are 
throughout the PRV genome like β-herpesviruses. Viral miRNAs are predicted to 
target multiple genes and form a complex regulatory network. GO analysis on host 
targets of viral miRNAs were involved in complex cellular processes, including 
the metabolic pathway, biological regulation, stimulus response, signaling 
process and immune response. Moreover, 13 host miRNAs were expressed with 
significant difference after infection with PRV: 8 miRNAs were up-regulated and 
5 miRNAs were down-regulated, which may affect viral replication in host cell. 
Our results provided new insight into the characteristic of miRNAs in response 
to PRV infection, which is significant for further study of these miRNAs 
function.

The complete sequence of an isolate (ZJ-V) of Duck hepatitis virus I (DHV-I), 
originally taken from the field in southeast China was determined. It was 7691 
nucleotides long and had 5'- and 3'-terminal non-coding regions of 626 and 315 
nucleotides, respectively. The poly(A) tail contained at least 22 residues and 
the single open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 2249 amino acids. The VP1 
gene was also sequenced from nine southeast China field isolates and three 
attenuated DHV-I vaccine strains. In phylogenetic analysis of the isolates and 
other published sequences, attenuated and tissue-adapted isolates (including 
ZJ-V) clustered as genotypes significantly different from the field isolates 
that had not been passaged in chicken/duck embryos. There were two consistent 
amino acid substitutions (E(129)-->V(129) and A(142)-->S(142)) between all the 
field isolates and all the tissue-adapted ones. The carboxyl terminal region was 
generally the most variable and here the four attenuated Chinese isolates showed 
six consistent differences from the field isolates (S(181)-->L(181), 
H(183)K(184)-->R(183)G(1841), N(193)-->D(193), E(205)-->K(205), R(217)-->K(217), 
N(235)-->D(235)). It seems likely that at least some of these differences result 
from mutations leading to isolate attenuation.

    Virus Genes. 2010 Jun;40(3):372-3.

The complete genomic sequence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain NDV08-004, 
isolated from domestic ducks in China, was determined in this study. The genome 
is 15198 nucleotides (nt) in length, follows the ""rule of six"" and contains a 
55-nt leader sequence at the 3' end and a 114-nt trailer sequence at the 5' end. 
Compared with the full genome sequences of Class II NDV strains, the NDV08-004 
isolate has a 12-nt insertion (TGGGAGACGGGG) in the phosphoprotein gene between 
nucleotides 2381 and 2382 of the genome (numbered according to the genomic 
sequence of the La Sota strain, which consists of 15186 nt). Strain NDV08-004 
has the motif (112)E-Q-Q-E-R-L(117) at the cleavage site of the fusion protein, 
which is typical of lentogenic NDV strains, and this is in agreement with the 
results of pathogenic tests based on the mean death time (MDT) and the 
intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 
full genome revealed that all the NDV strains studied could be divided into two 
distinct clades, namely class I and class II, and the NDV08-004 isolate 
characterized in this study was grouped in class I. Further phylogenetic 
analysis based on a 374-bp fragment of the F gene in class I strains of NDV 
demonstrated that NDV08-004 belongs to genotype 3, and should be therefore

Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) can infect many host species and cause acute 
myocarditis and respiratory failure in piglets, reproductive failure in pregnant 
sows. In this study, an EMCV strain, designated JZ1202, was isolated from 
semi-captive wild boars that presented with acute myocarditis and sudden death 
in central China. It was identified by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and genome sequencing. 
The subsequent results showed that the virus could produce a specific cytopathic 
effect on BHK cells and could cause clinical symptoms and pathological changes 
in mice. Complete genome sequencing and multiple sequence alignment indicated 
that JZ1202 strain was 81.3%-99.9% identical with other isolates worldwide. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome, ORF, VP3/VP1 and 3D genes using 
neighbor-joining method revealed that JZ1202 isolate was grouped into lineage 1. 
The results of this study confirmed that an EMCV strain JZ 1202 isolated from 
wild boar in central China was fatal to mice and provided new epidemiologic data 
on EMCV in China.

In order to evaluate the genetic variability of encephalomyocarditis virus 
(EMCV), the whole genomes of six EMCV field isolates originating from pigs and 
rats origin in different regions of central China, were phylogenetically and 
comparatively analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences, open 
reading frame (ORF), capsid coding region (CCR) and VP3/VP1 using 
neighbor-joining analysis revealed that these isolates belonged to lineage 1. 
Nucleotide sequences of six isolates showed more than 99% pairwise identity 
rates, and the sequences of isolates from pig and boar in the same region were 
completely identical with each other, without any genetic deletion or insertion. 
From comparative analysis of variability of each EMCV protein coding region, 3D 
and VP3 regions showed that the highest average identity rates, and was 
confirmed as highly conserved. In contrast, the protein coding regions 3A and 3B 
was confirmed to be highly variable region with the lowest average identity 
rate. Our data confirmed that the EMCV strains isolated from pigs and rats 
origin had high homology with each other, which implied rats may play an 
important role in EMCV transmission between domestic pigs and wild boars.

Ten representative isolates of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) obtained from 
outbreaks in waterfowl (geese and ducks) in China since 1997 were characterized 
both pathotypically and genotypically. The mean death time and intracerebral 
pathogenicity index were used to evaluate the virulence of the isolates. 
Pathogenicity tests showed that all 10 isolates were velogenic strains. The main 
functional region of the F gene made up of 535 nucleotides was amplified by 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The deduced amino 
acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site in all 10 isolates was 
112RRQKRF117, which is a typical sequence of velogenic strains and is in 
agreement with the results of in vivo pathogenicity tests. For genotyping, a 
phylogenetic tree based on nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene was constructed. 
Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the isolates were of the genotype VII 
virus. Only one strain, WG, was found to be of the genotype IX virus. This 
strain was closest to F48E9, which was isolated in China in 1946 and has been 
used as a standard challenge strain in vaccine evaluation in China. So, genotype 
IX virus still causes sporadic infections in geese in China. Further 
phylogenetic analyses on the genotype VII strains found that all these strains 
can be subdivided into 5 subgenotypes, and most of the isolates (8 strains) were 
classified as VIId, a predominant genotype responsible for most Newcastle 
disease (ND) outbreaks since the end of the past century in China. Only 1 
strain, NDV03-053, was shown to be of genotype VIIc virus. Results indicate that 
the strains of genotype VIId NDV have been the major pathogen, responsible for 
most epizootic ND outbreaks in waterfowl in China since 1997.

Seventy-nine velogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates were obtained from 
infected chicken flocks during the outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND) in 
various regions of the mainland of China in 2006. The F gene fragment (535bp, 
from nt 47 to 581 of the F gene) which codes the main functional region of the F 
protein was obtained by RT-PCR and sequenced. All sequences obtained in this 
study have been submitted to GenBank. All the isolates have the motif 
(112)R-R-Q/R-K/R-R-F(117) at the cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is 
typical of velogenic NDV isolates. For genotyping, a phylogenetic tree based on 
nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene was constructed, and the 79 isolates could be 
divided into two genotypes, namely VIId and III. Most of the isolates proved to 
be of genotype VIId; only two isolates were of genotype III. Genotype VIId NDV 
has been the predominant pathogen responsible for most Newcastle disease 
outbreaks in China. The proportion of isolates of genotype VIId NDV shows an 
increasing trend, according to studies on the molecular epidemiology of NDV in 
China from 2002 to 2006.

Eighty-three strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were obtained from 
outbreaks in chickens, pigeons, geese, and ducks in China in 2005 and 
characterized genotypically. The main functional region of the F gene (535 
nucleotides) was amplified and sequenced. A phylogenetic tree based on 
nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene was created using sequences from 83 isolates 
and representative NDV sequences obtained from GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis 
showed that all newly characterized strains belonged to six genetic groups: I, 
II, III, VIb, VIIc, and VIId. All the isolates belonging to groups I and II (14 
total) were lentogenic according to the amino acid sequences of the fusion 
protein cleavage site, and either V4 or LaSota-type, depending on the vaccines 
that were used. Most isolates (64 total) were classified in group VIId, a 
predominant genotype responsible for most Newcastle disease outbreaks since the 
end of the last century. One strain, NDV05-055, was in group VIIc, three pigeon 
strains were in group VIb, and one isolate, NDV05-041, was in group III, and 
characterized as a velogenic strain. This study revealed that genotype VIId was 
the major NDV strain responsible for the 2005 ND epizoonosis that occurred in 
China.

A goose parvovirus (GPV) Y strain was isolated from Muscovy ducks in Anhui 
Province of China. By polymerase chain reaction method, its complete genomic 
sequence was found to be 5,106 bp in length, consisting of 444-bp inverted 
terminal repeat, 1,844-bp non-structural protein and 2,199-bp capsid protein 
(VP) regions. Then its sequence was aligned with the sequences of GPV and 
Muscovy duck parvovirus published in the GenBank using the neighbor-joining 
method. The phylogenetic analyses based on the VP3 gene sequences revealed that 
the GPV Y strain along with those from Taiwan belonged to the subgroup IIb, 
while other GPV strains from Muscovy ducks belonged to the subgroup Ib and most 
of other GPV strains isolated in China mainland were clustered in the subgroup 
IIa. The absence of the deduced 703-705NRT glycosylation site in VP region may 
explain the host specificity of the GPV Y strain. The complete genomic sequence 
of the GPV Y strain from Muscovy ducks will help to understand the molecular and 
evolutionary characteristics of GPV.

H2 influenza virus caused a pandemic in 1957 and has the possibility to cause 
outbreaks in the future. To assess the evolutionary characteristics of H2 
influenza viruses isolated from migratory ducks that congregate in Hokkaido, 
Japan, on their flyway of migration from Siberia in 2001, we investigated the 
phylogenetic relationships among these viruses and avian and human viruses 
described previously. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the PB2 gene of 
Dk/Hokkaido/107/01 (H2N3) and the PA gene of Dk/Hokkaido/95/01 (H2N2) belonged 
to the American lineage of avian virus and that the other genes of the isolates 
belonged to the Eurasian lineage. These results indicate that the internal 
protein genes might be transmitted from American to Eurasian avian host. Thus, 
it is further confirmed that interregional transmission of influenza viruses 
occurred between the North American and Eurasian birds. The fact that 
reassortants could be generated in the migratory ducks between North American 
and Eurasian avian virus lineage further stresses the importance of global 
surveillance among the migratory ducks.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most 
important viral swine diseases, resulting in immense economic losses in Chinese 
pig industry. Currently, four major lineages: lineage 1 (NADC30-like), 3 
(QYYZ-like), 5.1 (VR2332-like) and 8.7 (JXA1-like) of type 2 PRRSV (North 
American type) have been circulating in China based on classification system, 
which have caused concern about the potential of virus recombination. In the 
present study, a novel variant of PRRSV strain named FJLIUY-2017 was isolated 
from abortion rate (25%) in pregnant gilts in Fujian Province in China in 2017. 
To further our knowledge about the novel virus strain, we characterized the 
complete genome of FJLIUY-2017. Comparison to PRRS sequences in GenBank 
confirmed the absence of close relatives (<92%), but indicated FJLIUY-2017 
belonged to NADC30-like PRRSV. The full length of FJLIUY-2017 was determined to 
be 15017 nucleotides (nt), excluding the poly(A) tail, shared 86.2-86.6% 
identity with JXA1-like strains (JXA1, TJ and FJYR), 88.9-90.6% with NADC30-like 
PRRSVs (NADC30, FJZ03 and CHsx1401), 86.4-86.5% with VR2332-like (VR2332, 
RespPRRS MLV and BJ-4) and only 60.8% with LV (European type). Recombination 
analyses revealed genomic breakpoints in structural (ORF3, ORF4 and ORF7) and 
nonstructural (Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp6, Nsp9, Nsp11 and Nsp12) regions of the genomes 
with evidence for recombination events between lineages 1, 3, 5.1 and 8.7. Taken 
altogether, the results of our study provide further confirmation that PRRSV is 
prone to undergo recombination events. Thus, it is critical to monitor PRRSV 
evolution in China and establish an effective strategy for the control of PRRS.

Genetic analysis indicated that the pandemic influenza strains derived from wild 
aquatic birds harbor viruses of 15 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) 
antigenic subtypes. Surveillance studies have shown that H9N2 subtype viruses 
are worldwide in domestic poultry and could infect mammalian species, including 
humans. Here, we genetically analyzed the HA and NA genes of five H9N2 viruses 
isolated from the migratory ducks in Hokkaido, Japan, the flyway of migration 
from Siberia during 1997-2000. The results showed that HA and NA genes of these 
viruses belong to the same lineages, respectively. Compared with those of 
A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97-like and A/duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97-like viruses, HA and 
NA of the migratory duck isolates had a close relationship with those of H9N2 
viruses isolated from the chicken in Korea, indicating that the Korea H9N2 
viruses might be derived from the migratory ducks. The NA genes of the five 
isolates were located in the same cluster as those of N2 viruses, which had 
caused a human pandemic in 1968, indicating that the NA genes of the previous 
pandemic strains are still circulating in waterfowl reservoirs. The present 
results further emphasize the importance of carrying out molecular 
epidemiological surveillance of H9N2 viruses in wild ducks to obtain more 
information for the future human influenza pandemics preparedness.

Bufavirus is a single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the genus Protoparvovirus. 
This study reports the identification and characterization of a porcine 
bufavirus by a metagenomic approach, and a limited epidemiology investigation of 
bufavirus in six swine farms. A comparative genome analysis showed a similarity 
of 93 % to a Hungarian porcine bufavirus. Bayesian and maximum-likelihood 
analyses of genome sequences showed a close relationship of porcine bufaviruses 
to human and monkey bufaviruses. Molecular dating of the most recent common 
ancestors supported a recent introduction of bufaviruses into human and pig 
populations, respectively. A real-time PCR method was developed to screen 60 
faecal samples for the porcine bufavirus DNA, and eight positive samples were 
found in two neighbouring farms, suggesting a relatively low prevalence 
(13.3 %). No direct transmission of porcine bufaviruses between two neighbouring 
farms was found, suggesting that bufaviruses may have spread widely in different 
geographical regions.

The genus Pestivirus comprises four established species: Bovine viral diarrhoea 
viruses 1 (BVDV-1) and 2 (BVDV-2), Border disease virus (BDV), and Classical 
swine fever virus (CSFV); and a tentative species, Pestivirus of giraffe. 
Additional pestiviruses have been identified and suggested for recognition as 
novel subgroups/species. To achieve a reliable phylogeny as the basis for 
classification of pestiviruses, a molecular dataset of 56 pestiviruses and 2089 
characters, comprising the 5'UTR, complete N(pro) and E2 gene regions was 
analysed by Maximum likelihood and Bayesian approach. An identical, robust tree 
topology was inferred, where seven well-supported monophyletic clades and two 
highly divergent lineages were identified. Dating most recent common ancestor 
was estimated for major pestivirus lineages and their evolutionary histories 
were revealed. Accordingly, a new proposal is presented for the classification 
of pestiviruses into nine species: BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BVDV-3 (atypical bovine 
pestiviruses), Pestivirus of giraffe, CSFV, BDV, Tunisian sheep virus (TSV; 
previously termed ""Tunisian isolates""), Antelope and Bungowannah.

A Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolated from an outbreak in racing pigeons in 
China was characterized in this study. Complete gene of the NDV isolate was 
sequenced and phylogenetic analysis. Pathogenicity experiment was carried out in 
pigeons, chickens, and ducks. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain 
clustered with the Class II viruses, has highly phylogenetically similar to NDV 
strains isolated from pigeons in China, but was distant from the viruses 
prevalence in chickens and vaccine strains used in China. The deduced amino acid 
sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein confirmed that the 
isolate contained the virulent motif (112)RRQKRF(117) at the cleavage site, but 
it caused no appearance disease in chickens and ducks. However, the isolate had 
virulence in pigeons, resulting in severe nervous signs and highly mortality. 
Pigeons were considered as a potential source of NDV infection and disease for 
commercial poultry flocks. Therefore, new vaccines to prevent the NDV infection 
in the pigeon flocks should be developed as soon as possible, and strict 
biosecurity measures should be taken to reduce the risk of pigeon Newcastle 
disease outbreaks.

Hepatitis E is considered as a public health problem in China. To determine the 
overall molecular epidemiology of hepatitis E virus (HEV) and analyze the 
situation of cross-species transmission between humans and swine in China over 
the last 25 years (1986-2011), 626 HEV complete and partial sequences (89 
isolates identified by our group) isolated from humans and animals in China were 
retrieved from GenBank and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. There were three 
genotypes and 11 sub-genotypes of HEV prevailing in China. Furthermore, rabbit 
HEVs, of which the genotype is controversial, are also widespread in China. 
Genotype 1 was the most isolated genotype prior to 2000 and mainly detected in 
Xinjiang, Beijing and East China. However, genotype 4, which was identified in 
most regions of China during the last 10 years, has overtaken genotype 1 in 
frequency of isolation nationwide. Genotype 3 HEV strains have been found only 
in eastern China and were thought to be imported from Japan. Both genotypes 3 
and 4 were found in humans and swine and cross-species transmission from pigs to 
humans of the two genotypes may have occurred in Northeast, Northwest, North, 
East and South China. These results indicate that HEV strains with considerable 
genetic diversity are widespread and the zoonotic transmission between swine and 
humans appears ubiquitous in China.

The spread of H5N1 virus into a wide range of avian and mammalian species may 
facilitate the adaptation of the virus to human populations. In the present 
study, a survey of avian influenza virus in tree sparrows was performed and a 
HPAI H5N1 virus (A/tree sparrow/Jiangsu/1/08) was isolated. The H5N1 virus was 
found to be a genotype V variant belonging to clade 2.3.4, which had newly 
emerged in southern China in 2005. Genetic analysis showed that it had a close 
relation with A/Jiangsu/1/07 (H5N1), which was thought to be responsible for a 
probable limited person-to-person transmission in a family cluster in China in 
2007. Pathogencity studies showed that the virus was highly virulent when 
experimentally inoculated into the chickens, tree sparrow, and mouse. As clade 
2.3.4, genotype V variant of H5N1 virus has been accounted for the most of human 
fatal cases in China during 2005-2008, the existence of such H5N1 variants in 
the tree sparrows highlights the potential threat of this type of wild bird 
infection to veterinary and public health.

"Systematic review of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome:virology, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics","<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was firstly discovered in China in 2010, followed by several reports from many other countries worldwide. SFTS virus (SFTSV) has been identified as the causative agent of the disease and has been recognized as a public health threat. This novel <jats:italic>Bunyavirus</jats:italic> belongs to the <jats:italic>Phlebovirus</jats:italic> genus in the family <jats:italic>Bunyaviridae</jats:italic>. This review also describes the different aspects of virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms on the basis of the published article surveillance data and phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences of large, medium, and small segments retrieved from database using <jats:sc>mega</jats:sc> 5.05, <jats:sc>simplot</jats:sc> 3.5.1, <jats:sc>network</jats:sc> 4.611, and <jats:sc>epi</jats:sc> information system 3.5.3 software. SFTS presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and considerable changes in several serum biomarkers. The disease has 10 ~ 15% mortality rate, commonly because of multiorgan dysfunction. SFTSV is mainly reported in the rural areas of Central and North‐Eastern China, with seasonal occurrence from May to September, mainly targeting those of ≥50 years of age. A wide range of domesticated animals, including sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, dogs, and chickens have been proven seropositive for SFTSV. Ticks, especially <jats:italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</jats:italic>, are suspected to be the potential vector, which have a broad animal host range in the world. More studies are needed to elucidate the vector–animal–human ecological cycle, the pathogenic mechanisms in high level animal models and vaccine development. © 2013 The Authors.

The sequence of a 6.0-kb fragment was compared in the 3'-encoding region of the 
genome in 27 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains. All these strains have 
the same S-3-M-5-N gene order, as is the case for other IBVs. However, the sizes 
of the corresponding open reading frames (ORFs) of some genes varied among the 
virus strains. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments demonstrated that 
recombination events had occurred in the origin and evolution of the strains 
CK/CH/LSD/03I and CK/CH/LLN/98I and the possible recombinant junction sites 
might be located at the 3c and M genes, respectively. The normal product of ORF 
3a is 57 amino acids long, whereas a 43-bp deletion at the 3'-end of the 
CK/CH/LSD/03I 3a gene was detected, resulting in a frameshift event and 
C-terminally truncated protein with 47 amino acids. Comparison of the growth 
ability in embryos and replication and pathogenicity in chickens with IBV 
carrying the normal 3a gene indicated that this deleted sequence in the 3a gene 
of CK/CH/LSD/03I was not necessary for viral pathogenesis and replication either 
in vitro or in vivo. Occurrence of a mutation at the corresponding position of 
the CK/CH/LLN/98I start codon in the 3a gene led to the absence of ORF 3a in 
this virus, resulting in a novel genomic organization at the 3'-encoding 
regions: S-3b, 3c-M-5a, 5b-N. Comparison with other viruses carrying the normal 
3a gene revealed that CK/CH/LLN/98I had replication and pathogenicity abilities 
in vivo similar to those of other IBVs; however, its growth ability in embryos 
was lower, although the relationship between the lower growth ability and the 
ORF 3a defect requires further confirmation.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a devastating disease in livestock industry. 
Most of the previous studies related to the PED were focused on the pathology 
and etiology of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). A little was known 
regarding the status of gut microbiota after piglets infected by PEDV. In this 
study, aided by metagenome sequencing technology, gut microbiota profiles in 
feces of viral diarrhea (VD) and viral control (VC) piglets were investigated. 
The results showed that the abundance of four dominant phyla (Fusobacteria, 
Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria) in feces was affected 
greatly by porcine epidemic diarrhea. Especially, the abundance of Fusobacteria 
was higher in VD piglets (36%) than in VC piglets (5%). On the contrary, the 
Verrucomicrobia was detected in lower distribution proportion in VD piglets 
(around 0%) than in VC piglets (20%). Furthermore, 25 genera were significantly 
different between VC and VD piglets at the genus level. Among the 25 genera, 
Leptotrichia belonging to Fusobacteria was remarkably lower in VC piglets than 
in VD piglets. Akkermansia belonging to Verrucomicrobia was higher in VC piglets 
than in VD piglets. Our findings implicated that the gut microbiota associated 
with PED significantly provided an insight into the pathology and physiology of 
PED.

Due to its high similarity to human hepatitis B virus (HBV), duck HBV (DHBV) is 
often used as an important model for HBV research. While inter-genotypic 
recombination of HBV is common, it has not been reported with DHBV. In this 
study, 32 non-redundant DHBV complete genomes were analyzed using phylogenetic 
methods and classified into two clusters, corresponding to the 'Chinese' and 
'Western country' branches previously reported based on geographical 
distribution. One 'Chinese' branch strain was isolated in Australia and three 
'Western country' branch strains were isolated in China, suggesting 
cross-geographical distribution of both branches. Recombination analyses of the 
32 DHBV genomes identified two possible inter-genotypic recombination events 
with high confidence value. These recombination events occurred between the 
lineages represented, respectively, by the Chinese isolate GD3 (AY536371, 
'Chinese' branch) and the American isolate DHBV16 (K01834, 'Western country' 
branch), giving rise to two Chinese recombinant isolates CH4 (EU429324) and CH6 
(EU429326). The identification of inter-genotypic recombination among 
circulating DHBV isolates suggests the usefulness of DHBV as a model for 
studying the mechanism of HBV recombination.

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is one of the most important virus which 
causes encephalitis. This disease is most prevalent in the south, southeast and 
the east region of Asia. In this study, two JEV strains, named JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 
and JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004, were isolated from aborted fetuses and seminal fluid of 
pigs in China. To determine the characteristic of these virus isolates, the 
virulence of two newly JEV isolates was investigated, the result evidenced that 
the JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 did not kill mice, while the JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004 displayed 
neurovirulence with 0.925log10 p.f.u./LD50. Additionally, the full genome 
sequences of JEV were determined and compared with other known JEV strains. 
Results demonstrated that the genome of two JEV isolates was 10,976 nucleotides 
(nt) in length. As compared to the Chinese vaccine strain SA14-14-2, the 
JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 and the JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004 showed 99.7% and 97.5% identity at 
the nucleotide level, 99.6% and 96.7% identity at the amino acid level, 
respectively. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the full-length genome revealed 
that two JEV isolates were all clustered into genotype III compared to the 
reference strains. Furthermore, selection analyses revealed that dominant 
selective pressure acting on the JEV genome was purifying selection. Four sites 
under positive selection were identified: codon 521 (amino acid E-227), 2296 
(amino acid NS4b-24), 3048 (amino acid NS5-521) and 3055 (amino acid NS5-528). 
Amino acid E-227 was proved to be related to neurovirulence. Taken together, the 
molecular epidemiology and functional of positively selected amino acid sites of 
two newly JEV isolates were fully understood, which might be helpful to predict 
possible changes in virulence.

Porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV; genus Cytomegalovirus, subfamily 
Betaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae) is an immunosuppressive virus that 
mainly inhibits the immune function of T lymphocytes and macrophages, which has 
caused substantial damage in the farming industry. In this study, we obtained 
the miRNA expression profiles of PCMV-infected porcine macrophages via 
high-throughput sequencing. The comprehensive analysis of miRNA profiles showed 
that 239 miRNA database-annotated and 355 novel pig-encoded miRNAs were 
detected. Of these, 130 miRNAs showed significant differential expression 
between the PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine macrophages. The 10 
differentially expressed pig-encoded miRNAs were further determined by stem-loop 
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the results were consistent 
with the high-throughput sequencing. Gene Ontology analysis of the target genes 
of miRNAs in PCMV-infected porcine macrophages showed that the differentially 
expressed miRNAs are mainly involved in immune and metabolic processes. This is 
the first report of the miRNA transcriptome in porcine macrophages and an 
analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanisms during PCMV infection. Further 
research into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive viral 
infections should contribute to the treatment and prevention of 
immunosuppressive viruses.

BACKGROUND: Porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) is an immunosuppressive virus that 
mainly inhibits T-lymphocyte and macrophage immune functions; it has 
significantly damaged the farming industry. Although recent studies have shown 
that miRNAs play important roles in immune responses, the regulatory mechanisms 
of miRNAs during immunosuppressive virus infection remain unclear.
METHODS: In this study, porcine small-RNA transcriptomes of PCMV-infected and 
uninfected vital organs were first characterised by high-throughput sequencing. 
miRDeep2 software was used to predict novel pig-encoded miRNAs. To verify the 
accuracy of the high-throughput sequencing results, stem-loop qRT-PCR was 
performed on 12 significantly DE miRNAs. The physical and functional 
interactions between the immune-related target genes of the DE miRNAs in 
PCMV-infected organs were analysed using the STRING database.
RESULTS: In total, 306 annotated and 295 novel miRNAs were identified from 
PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine organs, respectively, through alignment 
with known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs. Overall, 92, 107, 95, 77 and 111 miRNAs were 
significantly differentially expressed in lung, liver, spleen, kidney and thymus 
after PCMV infection, respectively. According to Gene Ontology enrichment 
analysis, target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs associated with 
immune system processes, regulation of biological processes and metabolic 
processes were enriched in every sample. Integrated expression analysis of the 
differentially expressed miRNAs and their target mRNAs in PCMV-infected thymus 
showed that the significant differential expression of specific miRNAs under the 
pressure of PCMV infection in central immune organs interfered with the 
expression of genes involved in important immune-related signalling pathways, 
thus promoting the viral infection.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive analysis of the responses of host 
small-RNA transcriptomes to PCMV infection in vital porcine organs. It provides 
new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during infection by 
immunosuppressive viruses.

In spring 2009, one strain of H5N1 clade 2.3.2 virus was isolated from wild 
swans in Shanghai, indicating the importance of the wild swan in the ecology of 
this highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) in Eastern China. 
Pathogenicity experiments conducted in this study indicated that the virus was 
highly pathogenic for chickens but lowly pathogenic for mammalian hosts, as 
evidenced by reduced infection of mice. The analysis of complete genome 
sequences and genetic evolution showed that A/Swan/Shanghai/10/09 (SW/SH/09) may 
be derived from the strain A/silky chicken/Shantou/475/2004 (CK/ST/04), which is 
homologous to the influenza viruses isolated from chicken, duck, pika, little 
egret, swan, mandarin duck and bar-headed goose in China Hunan, China Qinghai, 
Mongolia, Russia, Japan, Korea, Laos and Hong Kong during 2007-2011, indicating 
that the virus has retro-infected diverse wild birds from chicken, and 
significant spread of the virus is still ongoing through overlapping migratory 
flyways. On the basis of the molecular analysis, we also found that there was a 
deletion of the glycosylation site (NSS) in amino acid 156 of the hemagglutinin 
(HA) protein when compared with that of the other Clade 2.3.2 viruses isolated 
between 2007 and 2011. More importantly, the sequence analysis of SW/SH/09 virus 
displayed the drug-resistant mutations on the matrix protein (M2) and 
neuraminidase (NA) genes.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; Coronaviridae family) causes huge 
economic losses to the swine industry. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a regulatory role 
in viral infection and may be involved in the mammalian immune response. Here, 
we report a comprehensive analysis of host miRNA expression in TGEV-infected 
swine testis (ST) cells. Deep sequencing generated 3,704,353 and 2,763,665 reads 
from uninfected ST cells and infected ST cells, respectively. The reads were 
aligned to known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs in miRBase 19, identifying 284 annotated 
miRNAs. Certain miRNAs were differentially regulated during TGEV infection. 59 
unique miRNAs displayed significant differentially expression between the normal 
and TGEV-infected ST cell samples: 15 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and 
44 were significantly down-regulated. Stem-loop RT-PCR was carried out to 
determine the expression levels of specific miRNAs in the two samples, and the 
results were consistent with those of sequencing. Gene ontology enrichment 
analysis of host target genes demonstrated that the differentially expressed 
miRNAs are involved in regulatory networks, including cellular process, 
metabolic process, immune system process. This is the first report of the 
identification of ST cell miRNAs and the comprehensive analysis of the miRNA 
regulatory mechanism during TGEV infection, which revealed the miRNA molecular 
regulatory mechanisms for the viral infection, expression of viral genes and the 
expression of immune-related genes. The results presented here will aid research 
on the prevention and treatment of viral diseases.

Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the major diseases in poultry flocks all 
over the world caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). In the study, the 
complete genome sequence of strain A2 was sequenced and analyzed, which was a 
predominant IBV strain in China. The results indicated that there were 
mutations, insertions, and deletions distributed in the whole genome. The A2 
virus had the highest identity to S14 and BJ in terms of full genome, whereas 
had a further distance to Massachusetts strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed 
that A2 isolate clustered together with most Chinese strains. The results of 
this study suggest that strain A2 may play an important role in IBV's evolution 
and A2-like IBVs are predominant strains in China.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: A new molecular classification scheme has recently been 
adopted that groups all enteroviruses into four species, designated human 
enterovirus A (HEV-A) through D. In this study, we tried to demonstrate the 
correlation between this molecular classification scheme and clinical 
manifestations in patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reclassified the clinical isolates of enteroviruses 
from the preceding 4.5 years in our virology laboratory using reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and reviewed the clinical 
manifestations of 138 pediatric patients.
RESULTS: We reclassified 23 isolates of the five serotypes into the HEV-A group, 
110 isolates of 16 sero-types into the HEV-B group, five isolates into the HEV-C 
group, and no isolate of the HEV-D group. HEV-A species caused significantly 
more hand-foot-and-mouth disease (p < 0.001), herpangina (p = 0.029), and 
myoclonic jerks (p < 0.001) compared with HEV-B species. However, HEV-B species 
caused significantly more pharyngitis (p = 0.043), respiratory tract infections 
(p = 0.046), nausea and vomiting (p = 0.007), and aseptic meningitis (p = 
0.001). The only death in our report was caused by coxsackievirus A16, which 
belonged to the HEV-A group.
CONCLUSION: The association between the molecular classification of 
enteroviruses and related disease patterns is an important finding. We suggest 
that this molecular classification could be applied in a clinical laboratory as 
an alternative method under certain circumstances, such as limited availability 
of antisera or questionable serotyping results, to identify the untypeable 
isolates.

Origin and evolution of Nipah virus,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Nipah virus, member of the <jats:italic>Paramyxoviridae</jats:italic> family, is classified as a Biosafety Level‐4 agent and category C priority pathogen. Nipah virus disease is endemic in south Asia and outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia, Singapore, India, and Bangladesh. Bats of the genus <jats:italic>Pteropus</jats:italic> appear to be the natural reservoir of this virus. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of Nipah virus, to estimate the date of origin and the spread of the infection. The mean value of Nipah virus N gene evolutionary rate, was 6.5 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> substitution/site/year (95% HPD: 2.3 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup>–1.18 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>). The time‐scaled phylogenetic analysis showed that the root of the tree originated in 1947 (95% HPD: 1888–1988) as the virus entered in south eastern Asiatic regions. The segregation of sequences in two main clades (I and II) indicating that Nipah virus had two different introductions: one in 1995 (95% HPD: 1985–2002) which correspond to clade I, and the other in 1985 (95% HPD: 1971–1996) which correspond to clade II. The phylogeographic reconstruction indicated that the epidemic followed two different routes spreading to the other locations. The trade of infected pigs may have played a role in the spread of the virus. Bats of the Pteropus genus, that are able to travel to long distances, may have contributed to the spread of the infection. Negatively selected sites, statistically supported, could reflect the stability of the viral N protein. <jats:bold><jats:italic>J. Med.

Pigeon circovirus (PiCV) is taxonomically classified as a member of the 
Circovirus genus, family Circoviridae. The virus contains a single stranded DNA 
genome of approximately 2 kb, with minor length variations among different 
isolates. The occurrence of PiCV infections in pigeons (Columba livia) has been 
documented worldwide over the past 20 years; however, in Brazil there were still 
no reports on PiCV detection. This study identifies seven PiCV genomes recovered 
from domestic pigeons of South Brazil through high-throughput sequencing and 
shows a high frequency of PiCV infection, through quantitative real-time PCR. 
Phylogenetic classification was performed by maximum likelihood analysis of the 
full genomes, ORF V1 (Rep) and ORF C1 (Cap). The results show that either full 
genome or Cap based analysis allowed PiCV classification into five major clades 
(groups A to E), where Brazilian sequences were classified as A, C or D. 
Recombination analyses were carried out with Simplot and RDP4 and the results 
show that both Rep and Cap ORFs contain several recombination hotspots, pointing 
to an important role for such events in PiCV evolution.

Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are the most abundant carnivore species in the 
Northern Hemisphere. Since their populations are well established in peri-urban 
and urban areas, they represent a potential reservoir of viruses that transmit 
from wildlife to humans or domestic animals. In this study, we evaluated the 
faecal virome of juvenile and adult foxes from peri-urban areas in central 
Croatia. The dominating mammalian viruses were fox picobirnavirus and 
parvovirus. The highest number of viral reads (N=1412) was attributed to a new 
fox circovirus and complete viral genome was de novo assembled from the 
high-throughput sequencing data. Fox circovirus is highly similar to dog 
circoviruses identified in diseased dogs in USA and Italy, and to a recently 
discovered circovirus of foxes with neurologic disease from the United Kingdom. 
Our fox picobirnavirus was more closely related to the porcine and human 
picobirnaviruses than to known fox picobirnaviruses.

"Bacteria, phages and pigs: the effects of in-feed antibiotics on the microbiome at different gut locations","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Disturbance of the beneficial gut microbial community is a potential collateral effect of antibiotics, which have many uses in animal agriculture (disease treatment or prevention and feed efficiency improvement). Understanding antibiotic effects on bacterial communities at different intestinal locations is essential to realize the full benefits and consequences of in-feed antibiotics. In this study, we defined the lumenal and mucosal bacterial communities from the small intestine (ileum) and large intestine (cecum and colon) plus feces, and characterized the effects of in-feed antibiotics (chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine and penicillin (ASP250)) on these communities. 16S rRNA gene sequence and metagenomic analyses of bacterial membership and functions revealed dramatic differences between small and large intestinal locations, including enrichment of Firmicutes and phage-encoding genes in the ileum. The large intestinal microbiota encoded numerous genes to degrade plant cell wall components, and these genes were lacking in the ileum. The mucosa-associated ileal microbiota harbored greater bacterial diversity than the lumen but similar membership to the mucosa of the large intestine, suggesting that most gut microbes can associate with the mucosa and might serve as an inoculum for the lumen. The collateral effects on the microbiota of antibiotic-fed animals caused divergence from that of control animals, with notable changes being increases in Escherichia coli populations in the ileum, Lachnobacterium spp. in all gut locations, and resistance genes to antibiotics not administered. Characterizing the differential metabolic capacities and response to perturbation at distinct intestinal locations will inform strategies to improve gut health and food safety.</jats:p>",0

VP6, the most abundant protein of rotaviruses, contains epitopes that allow the 
classification of these viruses into four subgroups (SG), depending on the 
presence or absence of two epitopes called I and II. The subgroup-specific 
epitopes are conformational and appear to be present on trimeric but not 
monomeric VP6. We have identified on VP6 some of the amino acids that determine 
the reactivity of the subgroup-specific mAbs 255/60 and 631/9. A single amino 
acid mutation at positions 172 (Met to Ala) or 305 (Asn to Ala) was sufficient 
to change the subgroup specificity of the human rotavirus Wa VP6 protein from 
SGII to SGI/II, since either of these mutations allowed the protein to be 
recognized by the SGI mAb 255/60, while retaining its capacity to interact with 
the SGII mAb 631/9. In the case of the SGII epitope, the mutation of two 
contiguous amino acids (Ala305 Asn306 to Asn305 Ala306) in the porcine rotavirus 
YM VP6 protein (SGI) enabled the protein to be efficiently recognized by the 
SGII mAb 631/9, while causing the YM VP6 protein to lose its capacity to 
interact with mAb 255/60. These results suggest that both subgroup Abs interact 
with an antigenic domain in VP6 that is composed of at least two regions of the 
protein that, although distant in the linear sequence, might be in close 
proximity in the structured VP6 trimer.

First detection and analysis of a fish circovirus,"<jats:p>Circoviruses are present worldwide in birds and pigs but their occurrence in fish has not yet been reported.

This paper reports the detection of previously unknown circular viral DNA genomes in barbels by the use of a circovirus-specific wide-range nested PCR. The analysis of two complete genomes (Barbel circovirus, BaCV1 and BaCV2) indicated that they belonged into a new genetic group within the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, distinct from known circoviruses and circovirus-like genomes. Their genome size was 1957 bases and contained two major ORFs similar to the capsid and replication-associated protein genes of circoviruses.

Since 2000 several bluetongue virus (BTV) incursions have occurred in Sardinia 
(Italy) involving serotypes 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16. In October 2012, new BT outbreaks 
caused by BTV-1 and BTV-4 were reported. Nearly 500 flocks were infected and 
9238 sheep died because of the infection. When sequenced, Seg-10 of both strains 
shared 99% similarity at nucleotide level with BTV strains that have circulated 
in the Mediterranean basin in the last few years. Similarly, Seg-5 sequences of 
BTV-1 and BTV-4 newly isolated Sardinian strains are identical and cluster 
together with recent BTV-1 circulating in the Mediterranean Basin and the BTV-4 
strains isolated in Tunisia in 2007 and 2009. These BTV-4 strains differ from 
the ones that circulated in Europe from 2003 to 2005 and appear to be 
reassortant strains.

Hospital, Adelaide, SA, 5000, Australia.

The study of poxviruses pioneered the field of vaccinology after Jenner's 
remarkable discovery that 'vaccination' with the phylogenetically related cowpox 
virus conferred immunity to the devastating disease of smallpox. The study of 
poxviruses continues to enrich the field of virology because the global 
eradication of smallpox provides a unique example of the potency of effective 
immunization. Other poxviruses have since been developed as vaccine vectors for 
clinical and veterinary applications and include modified vaccinia virus strains 
such as modified vaccinia Ankara and NYVAC as well as the avipox viruses, 
fowlpox virus and canarypox virus. Despite the empirical development of 
poxvirus-based vectored vaccines, it is only now becoming apparent that we need 
to better understand how the innate arm of the immune system drives adaptive 
immunity to poxviruses, and how this information is relevant to vaccine design 
strategies, which are the topics addressed in this article.

In vitro and in vivo identification of structural and sequence elements in the 5′ untranslated region of Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus required for internal initiation,"<jats:p><jats:italic>Ectropis obliqua</jats:italic>picorna-like virus (EoPV) is a newly described insect virus that is classified as a putative member of the genus<jats:italic>Iflavirus</jats:italic>. The virus possesses a large, positive-sense RNA genome encoding a single polyprotein that shares physicochemical properties with those of members of the family<jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>. The 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) plays an important role in picornavirus translation initiation, as it contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that mediates cap-independent translation. To investigate translation in EoPV, an extensive range of mutations were engineered within the 5′ UTR and the effects of these changes were examined<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>by using a bicistronic construct. Results showed that deletions within the first 63 nt had little impact on IRES activity, whilst core IRES function was contained within stem–loops C and D, as their removal abrogated IRES activity significantly. In contrast to these findings, removal of stem–loop G containing two cryptic AUGs caused a remarkable increase in IRES activity, which was further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis at these two positions. It was also confirmed that initiation of protein synthesis occurs at AUG6 (position 391–394) and not at the AUG immediately downstream of the polypyrimidine tract. Mutation of the polypyrimidine tract (CCTTTC) had a slight effect on EoPV IRES activity. Furthermore, mutations of the RAAA motif led to a decrease in IRES activity of approximately 40 %<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>, but these results were not supported by<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>experiments. In conclusion, this study reveals that the EoPV IRES element is unique, although it has features in common with the type II IRESs.</jats:p>",0

H9N2 subtype influenza virus has become worldwide and prevalent in China. 
Previous studies illustrated that at least three sublineages had been 
established in terrestrial poultry of Eurasian avian. In this presentation, 
eight full-length genes of an H9N2 strain, A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/98 (Ck/SH/F/98) 
were obtained. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies were conducted by 
comparing eight genes with those of all the available H9N2 strains from the 
GenBank. The results showed that four genes (HA, NA, M and NS genes) of 
Ck/SH/F/98 were incorporated into the sublineage represented by the early 
mainland China strain, Ck/BJ/1/94. However, the other four of RNP genes of 
Ck/SH/F/98 did not show close relationship with those of the three known 
sublineages' viruses. Therefore, Ck/SH/F/98 was a natural reassortant between 
different sublineages. In addition, comparison showed that Ck/SH/F/98 could be a 
putative precursor of a later isolate from southern China, Dk/ST/1605/01, with 
at least six genes of both closely related, indicating genes of Ck/SH/F/98 and 
early isolates had ever been circulating. Further comparison in terms of 
molecular markers of species specificity of HA1 revealed that DK/ST/1605/01 also 
resembled Ck/SH/F/98 more than a common earlier duck strain. The results 
supported the idea of two-way transmission between terrestrial and aquatic birds 
that emphasized the importance to raise concerns on the natural evolution of all 
the eight genes of H9N2 avian influenza viruses.

The prevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA in faecal and bile samples from 
pigs in abattoirs in Eastern and South Western China from 2006 to 2011 was 
determined by reverse transcriptase PCR. HEV-3 was detected in 4/5952 (0.07%) 
pigs and HEV-4 was detected in 287/5952 (4.8%) pigs. Two HEV-3 subtype 3a 
strains from South Western China had 87.1-89.7% sequence identity. Two HEV-3 
subtype 3b strains from Eastern China had 91.8-93.8% sequence identity and were 
similar to strains reported previously in Eastern and Central China. The 
distinct subtypes of HEV-3 in different regions of China suggested multiple 
origins of HEV infection.

We report here the complete genome sequence of a bipartite virus, herein denoted 
WLPRV/human/BRA/TO-34/201, from a sample collected in 2015 from a two-year-old 
child in Brazil presenting acute gastroenteritis. The virus has 98-99% identity 
(segments 2 and 1, respectively) with the Wuhan large pig roundworm virus 
(unclassified RNA virus) that was recently discovered in the stomachs of pigs 
from China. This is the first report of a Wuhan large pig roundworm virus 
detected in human specimens, and the second genome described worldwide. However, 
the generation of more sequence data and further functional studies are required 
to fully understand the ecology, epidemiology, and evolution of this new 
unclassified virus.

Little information is available about the natural cycle of foot-and-mouth 
disease (FMD) in the absence of control measures such as vaccination. Cameroon 
presents a unique opportunity for epidemiological studies because FMD 
vaccination is not practiced. We carried out a prospective study including 
serological, antigenic and genetic aspects of FMD virus (FMDV) infections among 
different livestock production systems in the Far North of Cameroon to gain 
insight into the natural ecology of the virus. We found serological evidence of 
FMDV infection in over 75% of the animals sampled with no significant 
differences of prevalence observed among the sampled groups (i.e. market, 
sedentary, transboundary trade and mobile). We also found antibodies reactive to 
five of the seven FMDV serotypes (A, O, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3) among the animals 
sampled. Finally, we were able to genetically characterize viruses obtained from 
clinical and subclinical FMD infections in Cameroon. Serotype O viruses grouped 
into two topotypes (West and East Africa). SAT2 viruses grouped with viruses 
from Central and Northern Africa, notably within the sublineage causing the 
large epidemic in Northern Africa in 2012, suggesting a common origin for these 
viruses. This research will guide future interventions for the control of FMD 
such as improved diagnostics, guidance for vaccine formulation and 
epidemiological understanding in support of the progressive control of FMD in 
Cameroon.

Our investigation of 1004 faecal specimens from European bats for picornaviruses 
by broadly reactive nested reverse transcription-PCR found picornaviral RNA in 
28 samples (2.8 %). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial 3D genomic region 
suggested that one bat virus belonged to the species Enterovirus G (EV-G, 
formerly Porcine enterovirus B). Bat infection was supported by relatively high 
EV-G concentrations of 1.1×106 RNA copies per gram of faeces. All other bat 
viruses belonged either to the bat-associated genus Mischivirus, or to an 
unclassified Picornaviridae group distantly related to the genus Sapelovirus. 
Members of this unclassified sapelovirus-related group had RNA secondary 
structures in their 3'-nontranslated regions that were typical of enteroviruses 
and that resembled structures that occur in bat-associated coronaviruses, 
suggesting ancient recombination events. Based on sequence distances, several 
picornaviruses from European and Chinese bats were likely conspecific, 
suggesting connectivity of virus populations. Due to their high mutation rates 
and their diversity, picornaviruses may be useful tools for studies of bat and 
virus ecology.

Evolutionary Relationships among Parvoviruses: Virus-Host Coevolution among Autonomous Primate Parvoviruses and Links between Adeno-Associated and Avian Parvoviruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            The current classification of parvoviruses is based on virus host range and helper virus dependence, while little data on evolutionary relationships among viruses are available. We identified and analyzed 472 sequences of parvoviruses, among which there were (virtually) full-length genomes of all 41 viruses currently recognized as individual species within the family
            <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic>
            . Our phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes as well as open reading frames distinguished three evolutionary groups of parvoviruses from vertebrates: (i) the human helper-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 1 to 6 and the autonomous avian parvoviruses; (ii) the bovine, chipmunk, and autonomous primate parvoviruses, including human viruses B19 and V9; and (iii) the parvoviruses from rodents (except for chipmunks), carnivores, and pigs. Each of these three evolutionary groups could be further subdivided, reflecting both virus-host coevolution and multiple cross-species transmissions in the evolutionary history of parvoviruses. No parvoviruses from invertebrates clustered with vertebrate parvoviruses. Our analysis provided evidence for negative selection among parvoviruses, the independent evolution of their genes, and recombination among parvoviruses from rodents. The topology of the phylogenetic tree of autonomous human and simian parvoviruses matched exactly the topology of the primate family tree, as based on the analysis of primate mitochondrial DNA. Viruses belonging to the AAV group were not evolutionarily linked to other primate parvoviruses but were linked to the parvoviruses of birds. The two lineages of human parvoviruses may have resulted from independent ancient zoonotic infections. Our results provide an argument for reclassification of
            <jats:italic>Parvovirinae</jats:italic>
            based on evolutionary relationships among viruses.

Evolutionary relationships among Astroviridae,"<jats:p>To study the evolutionary relationships among astroviruses, all available sequences for members of the family <jats:italic>Astroviridae</jats:italic> were collected. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished two deep-rooted groups: one comprising mammalian astroviruses, with ovine astrovirus being an outlier, and the other comprising avian astroviruses. All virus species as well as serotypes of human astroviruses represented individual lineages within the tree. All human viruses clustered together and separately from non-human viruses, which argue for their common evolutionary origin and against ongoing animal-to-human transmissions. The branching order of mammalian astroviruses was exactly the opposite of that of their host species, suggesting at least two cross-species transmissions involving pigs, cats and humans, possibly through intermediate hosts. Analysis of synonymous (Ds) versus non-synonymous (Da) distances revealed that negative selection is dominating in the evolution of astroviruses, with the Ds:Da ratios being up to 46 for the comparisons of the most closely related viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of all open reading frames (ORFs) based on Ds resulted in the loss of tree structures, with virus species – and in ORF2, even serotypes of human astroviruses – branching out from virtually a single node, suggesting their ancient separation. The strong selection against non-synonymous substitutions, the low number of which is, therefore, not proof of a recent separation between lineages, together with the position of the oldest available human astrovirus strain (1971) far from the common node of its serotype 4, suggest that intraserotype diversification originates from an earlier date.</jats:p>",0

When first described in 1946, bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) was characterized as 
an acute transmissible disease associated with severe leucopenia, high fever, 
depression, diarrhea, gastrointestinal erosions, and hemorrhages. Recently the 
severe acute form has been related only to some hypervirulent BVDV-2 strains. 
This article reports the detection of BVDV-1b associated with an acute and fatal 
outbreak of BVD in a Brazilian beef cattle herd. Depression, anorexia, watery 
diarrhea, sialorrhea, and weakness were observed in six steers. One of these 
animals was evaluated for laboratorial, clinical, and pathological alterations. 
Laboratory findings were non-specific; clinically, the animal was weak, with 
dehydration and erosive oral lesions. Pathological alterations were predominant 
at the tongue, esophagus, and rumen. A RT-PCR assay using primers to partially 
amplify the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the BVDV genome was performed and 
identified BVDV in all clinical samples analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of BVDV 
derived from lymph node revealed that this strain was clustered within the BVDV 
subtype 1b. This differentiating was only possible to be performed by molecular 
characterization since both clinical presentation and pathologic findings were 
similar to BVDV-2 infection.

Hierarchical molecular tagging to resolve long continuous sequences by massively parallel sequencing,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Here we demonstrate the use of short-read massive sequencing systems to in effect achieve longer read lengths through hierarchical molecular tagging. We show how indexed and PCR-amplified targeted libraries are degraded, sub-sampled and arrested at timed intervals to achieve pools of differing average length, each of which is indexed with a new tag. By this process, indices of sample origin, molecular origin and degree of degradation is incorporated in order to achieve a nested hierarchical structure, later to be utilized in the data processing to order the reads over a longer distance than the sequencing system originally allows. With this protocol we show how continuous regions beyond 3000 bp can be decoded by an Illumina sequencing system and we illustrate the potential applications by calling variants of the lambda genome, analysing TP53 in cancer cell lines and targeting a variable canine mitochondrial region.</jats:p>",0

As part of our ongoing surveillance program, 40 field strains of avian 
infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from dead or diseased chicken 
flocks in different areas of China between 2009 and 2010. S1 glycoprotein genes 
of these strains were sequenced and analyzed with 38 strains published in 
GenBank. S1 genes of these isolated strains and the vaccine strains showed 
nucleotide homologies ranging from 65.2 to 82% and amino acid homologies ranging 
from 58.4 to 81.9%. Meanwhile, Chinese IBV strains isolated in this study, which 
were mainly nephropathogenic, could be separated into six variant lineages (CH 
I-CH VI), and current vaccine strains used in China formed Mass variant lineage 
that is evolutionarily distant from Chinese isolates. Moreover, CK/CH/GD/NC10, 
CK/CH/GD/KP10, and our previous isolates TC07-2 formed the CH VI lineage, 
showing larger evolutionary distances from other strains. Taken together, these 
findings suggested that various variant lineages were co-circulating in China 
now, and appeared to be continuously evolving, alternative indigenous vaccines 
indeed need for effective control of IB in China.

In this study, suspected classical swine fever (CSF) samples from the Guangxi 
Province of China were obtained from pigs with acute CSF, aborted fetuses, 
newborn pigs that died at 1-2 days of age, tonsils of healthy pigs, and 
leukocytes of immunized sows during 2001-2009. About 92 of 775 samples were 
found to be positive by RT-PCR, and 41 isolates were obtained. Phylogenetic 
analysis was performed on the 31 isolates by sequencing the E2 gene, and the 
isolates were found to cluster into two groups: (1) isolates from aborted 
fetuses (except GXGZ02), deceased newborn baby pigs, tonsils of healthy pigs, 
and leukocytes of immunized sows belonged to group 1.1, along with vaccine 
strain, HCLV, and standard virulent strain, Shimen, of China, and (2) 20 
isolates from pigs with acute CSF belonged to group 2.1, 13 of which were 
clustered into subgroup 2.1b with isolates from other provinces of China, and 7 
of which were clustered into subgroup 2.1a with isolates from Italy and Germany.

Pseudorabies (PR) or Aujeszky's disease (AD), caused by pseudorabies virus 
(PRV), is an economically important viral disease worldwide. Recently, PR 
outbreaks occurred in a large number of Bartha-K61-vaccinated swine herds in 
many regions of China. Here, we isolated a PRV variant, named TJ strain, from a 
Bartha-K61-vaccinated pig farm in China, evaluated the pathogenicity of the TJ 
strain in susceptible animals and analyzed its complete genomic sequence 
obtained by 454 pyrosequencing. Vaccination-challenge experiment in sheep showed 
that the classical Bartha-K61 vaccine could not provide complete protection 
against the challenge with the PRV TJ strain. In mice, the 50% lethal dose 
(LD50) of the TJ strain (10(2.3) TCID50) was lower than that of the classical 
PRV SC strain (10(3.0) TCID50). Furthermore, the TJ strain displayed higher 
mortality for pigs, as compared with the SC strain. The PRV TJ strain genome was 
determined to be 143,642 bp in length, encoding 67 open reading frames. The TJ 
strain was clustered to an independent branch together with some recent PRV 
isolates in China in the phylogenetic tree, which was relatively distant from 
previous PRV isolates. The TJ strain showed unique variations in the viral 
proteins that play key roles in the viral replication cycle. Taken together, the 
TJ strain is a highly pathogenic PRV variant with unique molecular signatures. 
Further studies are needed to explore the relevance of the sequence differences 
to the virulence alteration of the PRV variant.

A distinctive infectious bursal disease (IBD) virus genotype (ITA) was detected 
in IBD-live vaccinated broilers in Italy without clinical signs of IBD. It was 
isolated in specific-pathogen-free eggs and molecularly characterized in the 
hypervariable region of the virus protein (VP) 2. Phylogenetic analysis showed 
that ITA strains clustered separately from other homologous reference sequences 
of IBDVs, either classical or very virulent, retrieved from GenBank or 
previously reported in Italy, and from vaccine strains. The new genotype shows 
peculiar molecular characteristics in key positions of the VP2 hypervariable 
region, which affect charged or potentially glycosylated amino acids virtually 
associated with important changes in virus properties. Characterization of 41 
IBDV strains detected in Italy between 2013 and 2014 showed that ITA is emergent 
in densely populated poultry areas of Italy, being 68% of the IBDV detections 
made during routine diagnostic activity over a two-year period, in spite of the 
immunity induced by large-scale vaccination. Four very virulent strains (DV86) 
and one classical strain (HPR2), together with eight vaccine strains, were also 
detected. The currently available epidemiological and clinical data do not allow 
the degree of pathogenicity of the ITA genotype to be defined. Only in vivo 
experimental pathogenicity studies conducted in secure isolation conditions, 
through the evaluation of clinical signs and macro/microscopic lesions, will 
clarify conclusively the virulence of the new Italian genotype.

Accurate and precise real-time RT-PCR assays for the identification of astrovirus associated encephalitis in cattle,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A novel bovine astrovirus genotype species (BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1) was recently identified in brain tissues of cattle as a plausible cause of encephalitis. The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate real time RT-PCR assays for the detection of BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 in brain tissues of cattle. Three different primer-probe combinations were designed based on BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 full-genome sequences of 11 different strains identified in cattle, and established in three distinct one-step real time RT-PCR protocols. These protocols were compared regarding their diagnostic performance using brain tissues of cattle with and without astrovirus associated encephalitis. The limit of detection (LOD) of all three assays was between 1.34 × 10<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> and 1.34 × 10<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> RNA copies, leading to an analytical sensitivity two orders of magnitude superior compared to a conventional pan-astrovirus RT-PCR protocol (LOD 1.31 × 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> RNA copies). Amplification efficiency was in the range of 97.3% to 107.5% with linearity (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) &gt; 0.99. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the assays was determined as 100%, and all three revealed good intra- and inter-test repeatability. In conclusion, the newly developed RT-qPCRs are sensitive, specific, and reliable test formats that will facilitate BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 detection in routine diagnostics as well as in research settings.</jats:p>",0

Gallid herpesvirus 2 (GaHV-2), which causes Marek's disease in chickens and has 
caused extensive economic losses, has recently evolved increased virulence in 
China. To better understand the genetic basis of the pathogenic characteristics 
changed and increased virulence, we sequenced the genomes of six new GaHV-2 
strains (LCC, LTS, WC/1203, JL/1404, CC/1409, and HS/1412) isolated from 
chickens with failed immunisation as well as one previously isolated Chinese 
GaHV-2 strain, J-1. Based on a multiple sequence alignment, several 
characteristic point mutations were detected in the open reading frames of the 
Chinese isolates. In addition, two deletions and an insertion were identified at 
the unique short region and terminal repeat short region junctions in Chinese 
isolates, and the insertion was a characteristic of the new Chinese isolates. 
According to a phylogenetic analysis, the GaHV-2 genome diverged substantially 
over the last two decades in China. Based on the internal repeat long region, 
the new isolates were closely related to very virulent or very virulent plus 
strains. Additionally, the new Chinese isolates diverged from the previously 
isolated strains J-1 and 814. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that 
Chinese GaHV-2 strains contain characteristic sequences, especially the new 
isolates. The observed genetic divergence in the new Chinese GaHV-2 strains over 
the last two decades may be related to observed changes in pathogenic 
characteristics and virulence.

Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a single-stranded positive RNA virus that 
belongs to the family Picornaviridae. FMDV infects cloven-hoofed animals, such 
as pigs, sheep, goats, cattle and diverse wildlife species, and remains a major 
threat to the livestock industry worldwide. In this study, a transcriptome 
analysis of whole blood from pigs infected with FMDV was performed using the 
paired-end Illumina sequencing technique to understand the interactions between 
the pathogen and its host cells. During infection with FMDV, a total of 120 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 110 
up-regulated genes and 10 down-regulated genes. To further investigate the DEGs 
involved in interactions between the virus and its host, gene ontology (GO) 
annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment were 
conducted. GO annotation indicated that a number of DEGs were enriched in 
categories involved in host-virus interactions, such as response to stimulus, 
immune system process and regulation of biological process. KEGG enrichment 
analysis indicated that the DEGs were primarily involved in the ribosome 
signaling pathway and immune-related signaling pathways. Ten DEGs, including the 
immune-related genes BTK1, C1QB, TIMD4 and CXCL10, were selected and validated 
using quantitative PCR, which showed that the expression patterns of these genes 
are consistent with the results of the in silico expression analysis. In 
conclusion, this study presents the first transcriptome analysis of pig whole 
blood cells infected with FMDV, and the results obtained in this study improve 
our understanding of the interactions between FMDV and host cells as well as the 
diagnosis and control of FMD.

Nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoPCR) is a novel method for 
the rapid amplification of DNA and has been adopted for the detection of virus 
because of its simplicity, rapidity, and specificity. A nanoPCR assay was 
developed to detect and differentiate wild-type and gene-deleted pseudorabies 
virus (PRV). Three pairs of primers for nanoPCR developed in this study were 
selected from conserved regions of PRV, producing specific amplicons of 431 bp 
(gB), 316 bp (gE), and 202 bp (gG). The sensitivity of this assay using purified 
plasmid constructs containing the specific gene fragments was 100-1000 fold 
higher than conventional PCR. The PRV nanoPCR assay did not amplify porcine 
parvovirus, porcine circovirus type 2, porcine reproductive and respiratory 
syndrome virus, porcine teschovirus, or African swine fever virus but produced 
three bands of expected size with PRV and two bands of expected size with the 
gene-deleted PRV-Bartha-K61. Of 110 clinical samples collected from seven 
provinces in China, 53% and 48% were positive for wild-type PRV according to the 
nanoPCR assay and virus isolation, respectively.

Bluetongue (BT) is a non-zoonotic arboviral disease of certain wild and domestic 
species of cloven-hoofed ungulates. The causative agent, bluetongue virus (BTV), 
is spread through temperate and tropical regions of the world by biting 
Culicoides midges. Control of BTV infection is complicated by the plurality of 
virus serotypes and the ubiquity and opportunistic feeding behavior of its midge 
vector. The global distribution of BTV infection has recently altered, perhaps 
driven in part by climatic influences on midge species resident in different 
regions. The goal of this review is to evaluate realistic strategies that might 
be utilized to control or prevent future outbreaks of BT and other 
Culicoides-transmitted diseases. Importantly, optimal control of emerging, 
rapidly evolving arbovirus diseases such as BT will require integrated 
countermeasures that mitigate all aspects of the virus's transmission cycle. 
This will best be accomplished using preventative, rather than purely reactive 
strategies.

Vaccine-like viruses of American type of porcine reproductive and respiratory 
syndrome virus (PRRSV) were detected in serum samples by RT-PCR. The viruses 
were analysed by nucleotide sequencing of the genomic region encoding open 
reading frames 2 to 7. During the ongoing study of Danish isolates of PRRSV by 
means of nucleotide sequencing, RT-PCR reactions and subsequent nucleotide 
sequencing showed the presence of American type PRRSV in Danish breeding herds. 
Most likely, these atypical viruses originated from boars vaccinated with live 
vaccine of American type (MLV RespPRRS), which were taken to artificial 
insemination centres and there brought together with unvaccinated boars already 
at the centres. The nucleotide sequences of three Danish viruses of American 
type PRRSV were compared to those of known PRRSV isolates. The nucleotide 
sequence identities of the atypical Danish isolates were between 99.2-99.5% to 
the vaccine virus RespPRRS and 99.0-99.3% to VR2332 which are the parental virus 
to the vaccine virus. Phylogenetic analysis including field isolates of American 
type supports the conclusion that the introduction of American type PRRSV in 
Denmark was due to spread of vaccine virus.

RNA tumor viruses as classified in Retroviruses have been isolated and 
identified to induce tumors in a variety of animals including chickens, mice, 
and rats, or even in human in the last 100 years, since the first one has been 
reported in 1908. The RNA tumor viruses have been historically classified into 
two groups, acute transforming RNA tumor viruses and nonacute RNA tumor viruses. 
Acute transforming RNA tumor viruses are basically replication-defective and 
rapidly induce tumors by expressing the viral oncogenes captured from cellular 
genome in host cells. The first oncogene derived from Rous sarcoma virus was the 
src non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which has been identified to play the 
significant roles for signal transduction. On the other hand, nonacute RNA tumor 
viruses, which consist of only gag, pro, pol, and env regions but do not carry 
oncogenes, are replication-competent and could activate the cellular 
proto-oncogenes by inserting the viral long terminal repeat close to the 
proto-oncogenes to induce tumors with a long incubation period, as is termed a 
promoter insertion. These molecular mechanisms have been thought to induce 
tumors. However, very recently several reports have described that the 
retroviral structural protein Envelope could directly induce tumors in vivo and 
transform cells in vitro. These are very unusual examples of native retroviral 
structural proteins with transformation potential. In this review we look back 
over the history of oncogenic retrovirus research and summarize recent progress 
for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oncogenic transformation by 
retrovirus Envelope proteins.

BACKGROUND: Orf or contagious ecthyma is a zoonotic viral infection with a 
potential serious health threat for the small ruminants industry as well as 
humans. It is currently emerging in new territories.
RESULTS: Eight suspected clinical cases of pustular dermatitis in goats occurred 
in the rural area of Tebe, in south-eastern Gabon, in January 2013. The orf 
virus (ORFV) was detected by high-throughput sequencing on sera, buccal swabs 
and scab pool samples. It was confirmed in six out of eight sick goats by using 
specific PCR targeting the major envelope protein (B2L) and the orf virus 
interferon resistance (VIR) genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 
Gabonese strain and South Korean strains evolved from a common ancestor, 
suggesting an Asian origin of the ORFV' Gabonese strain.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the molecular detection of the ORFV strain 
involved in the cases of pustular dermatitis in goats and highlights its 
circulation in Gabon.

Eighty-nine bovine viral diarrhoea viruses (BVDV) from Australia have been 
genetically typed by sequencing of the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) and for 
selected isolates the N(pro) region of the viral genome. Phylogenetic 
reconstructions indicated that all of the samples examined clustered within the 
BVDV type 1 genotype. Of the 11 previously described genetic groups of BVDV-1, 
87 of the samples examined in this study clustered with the BVDV-1c, while two 
samples clustered with the BVDV-1a. Based on these analyses there appears to be 
limited genetic variation within the Australian BVDV field isolates. In 
addition, the phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that the clustering of 
Australian BVDV in the phylogenetic trees is not a result of geographic 
isolation.

The virus genus Circovirus belongs to the family Circoviridae and contains virus 
species with circular single-stranded DNA genomes. The viruses are known to 
infect vertebrate species, including pigs, dogs, pigeons and ducks. In this 
study a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to investigate 
prevalence of circoviruses in pigeons in the Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari province, 
Iran. A total of 50 faecal samples were subjected to nucleic acid extraction, 
PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Nested PCR primers were designed to 
amplify a 508 base pair segment of the pigeon circovirus (PiCV) capsid gene. Of 
the 50 faecal samples examined, 12 (24%) produced the expected DNA amplicons 
with identical DNA sequences. Phylogenetic analysis has grouped the viruses with 
those classified as group A circoviruses. The viruses were closely related to 
PiCVs found in Poland, Northern Ireland, the USA, Nigeria and Hungary. To the 
authors' knowledge, this is the first report of molecular detection and genomic 
characterization of PiCV from Iran.

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly discovered coronavirus that causes 
diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration in sucking and nursing piglets. It was first 
reported in Hong Kong in 2012 and has since been discovered in the United 
States, Canada, South Korea, mainland China, Thailand and Laos. PDCoV has been 
experimentally proved to lead to diarrhoea in swine and it was detected positive 
in pigs in Guangdong, southern China. In our study, 252 faecal and intestinal 
samples from sucking piglets and sows with diarrhoea were surveyed for common 
enteric viruses. We found a prevalence of PDCoV (21.8%), porcine epidemic 
diarrhoea virus (65.5%), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (0%), rotavirus 
group A (25.0%) and porcine kobuvirus (68.7%). We isolated 13 PDCoV strains and 
discovered that PDCoV infections were often co-infections with kobuvirus rather 
than the commonly linked porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus. Phylogenetic analysis 
of S gene and N gene revealed that 11 of 13 PDCoV strains belonged to Chinese 
lineage. As for the left two strains, one single strain (CHN-GD16-05) belonged 
to American and Korean lineages while another strain (CHN-GD16-03) was similar 
to a Thai strain, but only in the S gene. This suggested a possible 
recombination event between the Thai and the newly described Chinese strain.

"Human microRNAs profiling in response to influenza A viruses (subtypes pH1N1, H3N2, and H5N1)","<jats:p> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulation of gene silencing and are involved in many cellular processes including inhibition of infected viral replication. This study investigated cellular miRNA expression profiles operating in response to influenza virus in early stage of infection which might be useful for understanding and control of viral infection. A549 cells were infected with different subtypes of influenza virus (pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1). After 24 h post-infection, miRNAs were extracted and then used for DNA library construction. All DNA libraries with different indexes were pooled together with equal concentration, followed by high-throughput sequencing based on MiSeq platform. The miRNAs were identified and counted from sequencing data by using MiSeq reporter software. The miRNAs expressions were classified into up and downregulated miRNAs compared to those found in non-infected cells. Mostly, each subtype of influenza A virus triggered the upregulated responses in miRNA expression profiles. Hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-193b, hsa-miR-23b, and hsa-miR-30e* were upregulated when infected with all three subtypes of influenza A virus. Target prediction results showed that virus infection can trigger genes in cellular process, metabolic process, developmental process and biological regulation. This study provided some insights into the cellular miRNA profiling in response to various subtypes of influenza A viruses in circulation and which have caused outbreaks in human population. The regulated miRNAs might be involved in virus–host interaction or host defense mechanism, which should be investigated for effective antiviral therapeutic interventions. </jats:p>",0

From an industrial perspective, the conventional in vitro and in vivo assays 
used for detection of viral contaminants have shown their limitations, as 
illustrated by the unfortunate detection of porcine circovirus contamination in 
a licensed rotavirus vaccine. This contamination event illustrates the gaps 
within the existing adventitious agent strategy and the potential use of new 
broader molecular detection methods. This paper serves to summarize current 
testing approaches and challenges, along with opportunities for the use of these 
new technologies.
LAY ABSTRACT: Testing of biological products is required to ensure the safety of 
patients. Recently, a licensed vaccine was found to be contaminated with a 
virus. This contamination did not cause a safety concern to the patients; 
however, it highlights the need for using new testing methods to control our 
biological products. This paper introduces the benefits of these new tests and 
outlines the challenges with the current tests.

Nonspecific immunostimulation against viruses.

Mallick BB, Kishore S, Das SK, Garg A.

A trypsinized preparation from chromogenic selected strain of Mycobacterium 
phlei (NSI) stimulated the recipient immune system non-specifically against a 
variety of viruses viz. Rabies virus (RNA virus). Marek's disease (DNA virus) 
and Foot and Mouth disease virus (RNA virus) in phylogenetically different hosts 
like mice, chicks and guinea pigs respectively. Investigation into mechanisms of 
such nonspecific immunostimulation revealed that there was induction of strong 
cell mediated immune response (CMIR) against both specific as well as to 
nonspecific viral antigens as evinced by LMIT, lymphokine (LyIF) assay and 
lymphocyte transformation test etc. There was induction of appreciable quantity 
of ""Infectivity inhibiting substance(s)"" (IIS) which was not the classical 
antibody (Ig) in the serum of NSI inoculated animals and birds. This 
substance(s) neutralized FMD, IBR, rabies and Newcastle disease virus in cell 
culture, mice and in embryonated eggs. Electrophoretic separation of the NSI 
induced serum revealed an increase in beta fraction of globulin.

This report describes the first isolation and characterization of porcine 
circovirus 2 (PCV2) in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The virus was isolated from a 
dead piglet that did not exhibit any typical clinical symptoms of porcine 
circovirus disease at a pig factory in North Kazakhstan oblast (region). The 
isolated virus belongs to genotype 2 (PCV2) and shares 96.6% sequence homology 
with one isolate and two strains from China and two French strains in group 1, 
cluster 1ab and 96.4% homology with two strains isolated in China and one strain 
from Hungary. Electron microscopy revealed the isolated virus had the typical 
morphological structure of PCV. This is the evidence of occurrence of porcine 
circovirus 2 isolation and characterization in Kazakhstan.

Infectious particles, stress, and induced prion amyloids: a unifying 
perspective.

Transmissible encephalopathies (TSEs) are believed by many to arise by 
spontaneous conversion of host prion protein (PrP) into an infectious amyloid 
(PrP-res, PrP (Sc) ) without nucleic acid. Many TSE agents reside in the 
environment, with infection controlled by public health measures. These include 
the disappearance of kuru with the cessation of ritual cannibalism, the dramatic 
reduction of epidemic bovine encephalopathy (BSE) by removal of contaminated 
feed, and the lack of endemic scrapie in geographically isolated Australian 
sheep with susceptible PrP genotypes. While prion protein modeling has 
engendered an intense focus on common types of protein misfolding and amyloid 
formation in diverse organisms and diseases, the biological characteristics of 
infectious TSE agents, and their recognition by the host as foreign entities, 
raises several fundamental new directions for fruitful investigation such as: 
(1) unrecognized microbial agents in the environmental metagenome that may cause 
latent neurodegenerative disease, (2) the evolutionary social and protective 
functions of different amyloid proteins in diverse organisms from bacteria to 
mammals, and (3) amyloid formation as a beneficial innate immune response to 
stress (infectious and non-infectious). This innate process however, once 
initiated, can become unstoppable in accelerated neuronal aging.

During 2000-2007, 218 influenza viruses of 28 different combinations of HA 
(H1-H13) and NA (N1-N9) subtypes were isolated from fecal samples of free-flying 
water birds at two distant lakes in Hokkaido, Japan. Phylogenic analysis of the 
matrix (M) genes of 67 strains, selected on the basis of their subtype 
combinations, revealed that A/duck/Hokkaido/W95/2006 (H10N8) was a reassortant 
whose M and NA genes [corrected] belonged to North American non-gull-avian and 
the other six [corrected] genes to Eurasian non-gull-avian lineages. The M genes 
of other 65 strains belonged to Eurasian non-gull-avian and the one to 
Eurasian-gull lineages. The M genes of 65 strains were grouped into three 
different sublineages, indicating that influenza viruses circulating in 
different populations of free-flying water birds have evolved independently in 
nature.

Infectious bronchitis virus (Gammacoronavirus, Coronaviridae) is a genetically 
variable RNA virus (27.6kb) that causes one of the most persistent respiratory 
disease in poultry. The virus is classified in genotypes with different 
epidemiological relevance and clinical implications. The present study reports 
the development and validation of specific RT-qPCR assays for the detection of 
two major IBV genotypes: South America I (SAI) and Asia/South America II 
(A/SAII). The SAI genotype is an exclusive and widespread South American lineage 
while the A/SAII genotype is distributed in Asia, Europe and South America. Both 
identification assays employ TaqMan probes that hybridize with unique sequences 
in the spike glycoprotein gene. The assays successfully detected all the 
assessed strains belonging to both genotypes, showing high specificity and 
absence of cross-reactivity. Using serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA 
we obtained acceptable determination coefficients, PCR efficiencies and 
relatively small intra- and inter-assay variability. The assays demonstrated a 
wide dynamic range between 10(1)-10(7) and 10(2)-10(7) RNA copies/reaction for 
SAI and A/SAII strains, respectively. The possibility to characterize a large 
number of samples in a rapid, sensitive and reproducible way makes these 
techniques suitable tools for routine testing, IBV control, and epidemiological 
research in poultry.

Infectious bronchitis virus (Gammacoronavirus, Coronaviridae) is a genetically 
variable RNA virus that causes one of the most persistent respiratory diseases 
in poultry. The virus is classified in genotypes and lineages with different 
epidemiological relevance. Two lineages of the GI genotype (11 and 16) have been 
widely circulating for decades in South America. GI-11 is an exclusive South 
American lineage while the GI-16 lineage is distributed in Asia, Europe and 
South America. Here, we obtained the whole genome of two Uruguayan strains of 
the GI-11 and GI-16 lineages using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The 
strains here sequenced are the first obtained in South America for the 
infectious bronchitis virus and provide new insights into the origin, spreading 
and evolution of viral variants. The complete genome of the GI-11 and GI-16 
strains have 27,621 and 27,638 nucleotides, respectively, and possess the same 
genomic organization. Phylogenetic incongruence analysis reveals that both 
strains have a mosaic genome that arose by recombination between Euro Asiatic 
strains of the GI-16 lineage and ancestral South American GI-11 viruses. The 
recombination occurred in South America and produced two viral variants that 
have retained the full-length S1 sequences of the parental lineages but are 
extremely similar in the rest of their genomes. These recombinant virus have 
been extraordinary successful, persisting in the continent for several years 
with a notorious wide geographic distribution. Our findings reveal a singular 
viral dynamics and emphasize the importance of complete genomic characterization 
to understand the emergence and evolutionary history of viral variants.

The study of basic biological properties of H5N1 subtype strain isolated during 
an outbreak among wild birds in Russia in 2010 was presented. The study was 
carried out using conventional methods according to the WHO recommendations. 
H5N1 influenza virus isolated in Siberia belonged to clade 2.3.2 of the 
hemagglutinin gene; the phylogenetic analysis was performed. The antigenic 
characteristics and the basic genetic markers of biological properties were 
studied. It was shown that all strains were highly pathogenic for chickens and 
white mice. Thus, it was shown that in Russia in the 2010 H5N1 virus 
phylogenetically closely related to Asian variants caused epizootic among wild 
birds. The potential danger of this variant of the virus for humans was 
confirmed by different methods. We discussed the possibility of formation of 
H5N1 influenza natural focus.

Nairobi sheep disease (NSD) virus is the prototype of the tick-borne NSD 
serogroup, genus Nairovirus, family Bunyaviridae. It is highly pathogenic for 
sheep and goats, causes disease in humans, and is widespread throughout East 
Africa. Ganjam virus has caused disease in goats and humans in India. Due to 
their occurrence on different continents and association with different ticks, 
these viruses were considered distinct despite serologic cross-reactivity. Their 
S RNA genome segments and encoded nucleocapsid proteins were found to be 1590 
nucleotides and 482 amino acids in length and differed by only 10 and 3% at 
nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Genetic and serologic data 
demonstrate that Ganjam virus is an Asian variant of NSD virus. These viruses 
were phylogenetically more closely related to Hazara virus than Dugbe virus.

Complete genomes of the first isolates of pigeon adenovirus 1 (PiAdV-1) and 
Muscovy duck adenovirus (duck adenovirus 2, DAdV-2) were sequenced. The PiAdV-1 
genome is 45,480bp long, and has a gene organization most similar to turkey 
adenovirus 1. Near the left end of the genome, it lacks ORF0, ORF1A, ORF1B and 
ORF1C, and possesses ORF52, whereas six novel genes were found near the right 
end. The DAdV-2 genome is 43,734bp long, and has a gene organization similar to 
that of goose adenovirus 4 (GoAdV-4). It lacks ORF51, ORF1C and ORF54, and 
possesses ORF55A and five other novel genes. PiAdV-1 and DAdV-2 genomes contain 
two and one fiber genes, respectively. Genome organization, G+C content, 
molecular phylogeny and host type confirm the need to establish two novel 
species (Pigeon aviadenovirus A and Duck aviadenovirus B) within the genus 
Aviadenovirus. Phylogenetic data show that DAdV-2 is most closely related to 
GoAdV-4.

Rabies is endemic in Sudan and remains a continual threat to public health as 
transmission to humans is principally dog-mediated. Additionally, large-scale 
losses of livestock occur each year causing economic and social dilemmas. In 
this study, we analysed a cohort of 143 rabies viruses circulating in Sudan 
collected from 10 different animal species between 1992 and 2006. Partial 
nucleoprotein sequence data (400 bp) were obtained and compared to available 
sequence data of African classical rabies virus (RABV) isolates. The Sudanese 
sequences formed a discrete cluster within the Africa 1a group, including a 
small number of sequences that clustered with sequences from Ethiopian RABV. 
These latter sequences share an Aspartic Acid at position 106 (Asp(106)) with 
all other Africa 1a group members, in contrast to the remaining Sudanese 
strains, which encode Glutamic Acid at this position (Glu(106)). Furthermore, 
when representatives of other African and European lineages were aligned, 
Glu(106) is unique to Sudan, which supports the concept of a single distinct 
virus strain circulating in Sudan. The high sequence identity in all Sudanese 
isolates studied, demonstrates the presence of a single rabies virus biotype for 
which the principal reservoir is the domestic dog.

Rotaviruses are important enteric pathogens of humans and animals. Group A 
rotaviruses (GARVs) account for up to 1 million children deaths each year, 
chiefly in developing countries and human vaccines are now available in many 
countries. Rotavirus-associated enteritis is a major problem in livestock 
animals, notably in young calves and piglets. Early in the epidemiological GARV 
studies in humans, either sporadic cases or epidemics by atypical, animal-like 
GARV strains were described. Complete genome sequencing of human and animal GARV 
strains has revealed a striking genetic heterogeneity in the 11 double stranded 
RNA segments across different rotavirus strains and has provided evidence for 
frequent intersections between the evolution of human and animal rotaviruses, as 
a result of multiple, repeated events of interspecies transmission and 
subsequent adaptation.

Diarrhoea in lambs and kids is often a complex, multi-factorial syndrome. Common 
infectious causes of diarrhoea in lambs and kids during the first month of life 
are of bacterial or parasite nature. However, despite appreciable improvements 
in management practices and prevention and treatment strategies over the last 
decades, diarrhoea is still a common and costly syndrome affecting newborn small 
ruminants. Recent advances in the diagnostics and metagenomic investigations of 
the enteric environment have allowed discovering a number of novel viruses, 
although their pathobiological properties remain largely unknown. Assessing more 
in depth the impact of these viruses on the health and productions of these 
livestock animals is necessary and requires the development of accurate 
diagnostic tools and updating of the diagnostic algorithms of enteric 
pathological conditions.

Rotavirus B (RVB) has been identified as a causative agent of diarrhea in rats, 
humans, cattle, lambs, and swine. Recently, 20 RVB VP7 genotypes were determined 
based on an 80% nucleotide percent cut-off value. In this study, we sequenced 
the RVB VP6 gene segment from 80 RVB positive swine samples from the United 
States and Japan. Phylogenetic analyses, using the 30 available RVB VP6 
sequences from GenBank and our 80 novel RVB VP6 sequences, revealed a large 
genetic diversity of RVB strains, mainly in pigs. For classification purposes, 
pairwise identity frequency analyses suggested an 81% nucleotide percent cut-off 
value, resulting in 13 RVB VP6 (I) genotypes. In addition, an intragenic 
recombinant RVB VP6 segment was identified from Japan. Furthermore, the data 
indicates frequent reassortment events occurred between the porcine RVB VP7 and 
VP6 gene segments.

In alpine pasture, interspecies transmission has recently been incriminated in 
the epidemiology of pestivirus infection. The aim of this study was to 
investigate pestivirus infections in wild and domestic ruminants sharing 
pastures in the French Southern Alps. Animal sera were screened for pestivirus 
antibodies against the pestivirus NS3 protein by a commercial blocking enzyme 
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All 38 domestic herds tested were positive 
for pestivirus-specific antibodies. Individual sero-prevalence reached 76.5% 
(95% confidence interval [95% CI]: [74.2-78.8%]) of the 1383 sheep tested. For 
wild ruminants, 38.7% (95% CI: [33.8-43.9%]) of the 369 chamois tested, 28.7% 
(95% CI: [17.4-38.1%]) of the 72 roe deer, and 22.2% (95% CI: [6.5-37.9%]) of 
the 27 mouflons were seropositive. Virus screening was carried out on spleen 
samples from hunted wild animals (n=160) and from 15 domestic ruminants 
(clinically suspected to be persistently infected animals), by a conventional 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Three pestivirus 
strains were isolated from the sheep samples positive by RT-PCR. The viruses 
were classified in the BDV-3, BDV-Tunisian and BDV-6 genotypes. For the first 
time, one strain (RUPI-05 strain) was isolated from an alpine chamois and 
clustered in the BDV-6 genotype, showing in the 5'-UTR region 92% of identity 
with the ovine isolate from the same area. Thus, an active circulation of 
pestiviruses was demonstrated in both wild and domestic ungulates from the 
French Southern Alps. The results suggest that interspecies transmission between 
sheep and chamois probably occur.

Recombination in Eukaryotic Single Stranded DNA Viruses,"<jats:p>Although single stranded (ss) DNA viruses that infect humans and their domesticated animals do not generally cause major diseases, the arthropod borne ssDNA viruses of plants do, and as a result seriously constrain food production in most temperate regions of the world. Besides the well known plant and animal-infecting ssDNA viruses, it has recently become apparent through metagenomic surveys of ssDNA molecules that there also exist large numbers of other diverse ssDNA viruses within almost all terrestrial and aquatic environments. The host ranges of these viruses probably span the tree of life and they are likely to be important components of global ecosystems. Various lines of evidence suggest that a pivotal evolutionary process during the generation of this global ssDNA virus diversity has probably been genetic recombination. High rates of homologous recombination, non-homologous recombination and genome component reassortment are known to occur within and between various different ssDNA virus species and we look here at the various roles that these different types of recombination may play, both in the day-to-day biology, and in the longer term evolution, of these viruses. We specifically focus on the ecological, biochemical and selective factors underlying patterns of genetic exchange detectable amongst the ssDNA viruses and discuss how these should all be considered when assessing the adaptive value of recombination during ssDNA virus evolution.</jats:p>",0

Group A rotavirus is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis in children and 
young animals. During a retrospective analysis of samples collected from 
Paraguayan children under 5 years old with diarrhea, and previously negative for 
rotavirus and norovirus, we detected the presence of bovine rotavirus sequences 
by viral metagenomics. Nucleic acid was extracted direct from stool sample and 
determined to be G8P[1]. The genomic analyzes revealed that the strain presents 
an Artiodactyl-like genome (G8-P[1]-I2-R2-C2-M1-Ax-N2-T6-E12-H3) suggesting a 
direct animal-to-human transmission.

Bovine coronavirus has been associated with diarrhoea in newborn calves, winter 
dysentery in adult cattle and respiratory tract infections in calves and feedlot 
cattle. In Cuba, the presence of BCoV was first reported in 2006. Since then, 
sporadic outbreaks have continued to occur. This study was aimed at deepening 
the knowledge of the evolution, molecular markers of virulence and epidemiology 
of BCoV in Cuba. A total of 30 samples collected between 2009 and 2011 were used 
for PCR amplification and direct sequencing of partial or full S gene. Sequence 
comparison and phylogenetic studies were conducted using partial or complete S 
gene sequences as phylogenetic markers. All Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences 
were located in a single cluster supported by 100% bootstrap and 1.00 posterior 
probability values. The Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were also clustered 
with the USA BCoV strains corresponding to the GenBank accession numbers 
EF424621 and EF424623, suggesting a common origin for these viruses. This 
phylogenetic cluster was also the only group of sequences in which no 
recombination events were detected. Of the 45 amino acid changes found in the 
Cuban strains, four were unique.

Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is highly 
heterogenic. This heterogeneity has an effect on antigenic composition of PRRSV 
and might create differences in sensitivity to neutralization between isolates. 
The sensitivity to neutralization could be an important feature of PRRSV 
isolates because it is likely that isolates resistant to neutralization pose a 
significant challenge for the development of vaccines that elicit broad 
protective immunity. Nonetheless, little information is available for 
understanding or categorizing the viral neutralization phenotype of PRRSV 
isolates. Consequently, the main purpose of this study was to determine whether 
PRRSV isolates differ in their susceptibility to neutralization and if they can 
be classified in different categories based on their neutralization phenotype. 
For this purpose, a panel of 39 PRRSV isolates and a set of 30 hyperimmune 
monospecific sera were used in cross-neutralization assays. The results of this 
study indicate that PRRSV isolates differ in their sensitivity to neutralization 
and k-means clustering system allowed classifying the isolates in four different 
categories according to their neutralization phenotype: highly sensitive, 
sensitive, moderately sensitive and resistant to neutralization. Further 
analyses using two additional clustering systems that considered individual data 
for the classification of the isolates confirmed that classification obtained by 
k-means is accurate in most cases and that only in a few instances 
classification is less stringent. Sequences of GP3, GP4 and GP5 were analyzed 
but no correlation could be found between the sequence of previously identified 
neutralizing epitopes or the number of N-linked glycosylation sites in different 
proteins and the neutralization phenotype of the isolates. These data provide 
the first systematic assessment of overall neutralization sensitivities of a 
panel of diverse PRRSV isolates. The classification of the isolates provides a 
useful tool to facilitate the systematic characterization of neutralizing 
antibody production elicited by new vaccine candidates.

genotype P[14] strains were identified in Hungary totaling<0.1% of all human 
rotaviruses whose genotype had been determined. In this study we report the 
genome sequence and phylogenetic analysis of a human genotype G8P[14] strain, 
RVA/Human-wt/HUN/182-02/2001/G8P[14]. The whole genome constellation 
(G8-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3) of this strain was shared with another 
Hungarian zoonotic G8P[14] strain, RVA/Human-wt/HUN/BP1062/2004/G8P[14], 
although phylogenetic analyses revealed the two rotaviruses likely had different 
progenitors. Overall, our findings indicate that human G8P[14] rotavirus 
detected in Hungary in the past originated from independent zoonotic events. 
Further studies are needed to assess the public health risk associated with 
infections by various animal rotavirus strains.

Characterization of H9N2 influenza A viruses isolated from chicken products imported into Japan from China,"<jats:p>We characterized eleven H9N2 influenza A viruses isolated from chicken products imported from China. Genetically they were classified into six distinct genotypes, including five already known genotypes and one novel genotype. This suggested that such multiple genotypes of the H9N2 virus have possibly already become widespread and endemic in China. Two isolates have amino-acid substitutions that confer resistance to amantadine in the M2 region, and this supported the evidence that this mutation might be a result of the wide application of amantadine for avian influenza treatment in China. These findings emphasize the importance of surveillance for avian influenza virus in this region, and of quarantining imported chicken products as potential sources for the introduction of influenza virus.</jats:p>",0

To understand the genetic diversity of the S2 gene of infectious bronchitis 
viruses (IBV) isolated in Japan, we determined the nucleotide sequences of these 
IBVs using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method coupled 
with direct sequencing. IBV isolated in Japan were classified into six different 
groups by phylogenetic analysis based on the S2 gene. However, the 
classification based on the S2 gene of IBV isolated in Japan was different for 
some of the strains from those obtained with our previous analysis of the S1 
gene. This suggested that genetic recombination between the virus strains 
classified into different genetic groups had occurred in poultry, and that 
recombinant viruses might be epidemic in Japan.

The complete nucleotide sequences of the fusion (F) protein gene of Newcastle 
disease viruses (NDV) isolated in Japan from 1930 to 2007 (45 strains total) 
were determined and genetically analyzed. In the deduced amino acid sequences of 
fusion protein, the 5 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites and 10 
cysteine residues were all conserved in the NDV examined in this study. The 
major epitopes involved in virus neutralization are conserved in most of the NDV 
strains isolated in Japan except a few strains. By virus neutralization test, no 
major antigenic differences were observed among representative strains of each 
genotype in Japan. All chickens vaccinated with the B1 strain survived without 
clinical signs after challenge with 2 NDV strains isolated in Japan (velogenic 
strains, JP/Ibaraki/2000 and JP/Kagoshima/91), which possess amino acids 
substitutions involved in virus neutralization in the F protein gene.

BACKGROUND: The rising demand for pork has resulted in a massive expansion of 
pig production in Uganda. This has resulted in increased contact between humans 
and pigs. Pigs can act as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore 
identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health 
surveillance. In this study, during a routine general surveillance for African 
swine fever, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and 
DNA viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method.
FINDINGS: Serum samples from 16 domestic pigs were collected from five regions 
in Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and 
sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among the sequences assigned to a taxon, 
53% mapped to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, Torque 
teno viruses (TTVs), and porcine endogenous retroviruses were identified. 
Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had sequences that showed 98% 
sequence identity to Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads had identity to the 
class Insecta indicating that these sequences were unlikely to result from 
contamination with mosquito nucleic acids.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host 
for Ndumu virus. NDUV had been previously isolated only from culicine 
mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a potential zoonotic pathogen, 
particularly given the increasing risk of human-livestock-mosquito contact.

Studies based on low-stringency hybridizations of radiolabeled swinepox virus 
(SPV) DNA to Southern blots containing DNA of representative members of the 
Orthopoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, and Avipoxvirus genera and the Entomopoxvirus 
subfamily have revealed no DNA homology at this level of resolution. Antigenic 
relatedness between SPV and vaccinia was also analyzed using 
immunoprecipitations and revealed little if any cross-reactivity. The growth 
characteristics of SPV in tissue culture were examined by light microscopy and 
revealed both a delayed and a different cytopathology than that of vaccinia 
virus. SPV causes foci in pig kidney cells that are not evident until at least 4 
days postinfection, whereas vaccinia rapidly generates plaques on these cells. 
The kinetics of DNA accumulation, protein expression, and RNA transcription of 
SPV have been examined and indicate that each of these facets of the SPV growth 
cycle is also considerably delayed when compared to vaccinia virus. Our data 
indicate that swinepox virus is unique from other poxviruses characterized to 
date and supports the classification of swinepox virus into a separate genus, 
Suipoxvirus, within the poxvirus family.

There are few reports describing diarrhea of adult cattle caused by group A 
rotaviruses. Here, we report the identification of a novel bovine group A 
rotavirus from diarrhea of adult cows. A group A rotavirus was detected from an 
epizootic outbreak of diarrhea in adult cows with a decrease in milk production 
in Japan in 2013. The comprehensive genomic analyses from fecal samples by viral 
metagenomics using a next-generation sequencer revealed that it had an 
unreported genotype combination G15P[14]. The genome constellation of this 
strain, namely, RVA/Cow-wt/JPN/Tottori-SG/2013/G15P[14] was 
G15-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 representing 
VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5, respectively. Each gene 
segment of Tottori-SG was most closely related to Japanese bovine group A 
rotaviruses suggesting that Tottori-SG might have derived from multiple 
reassortment events from group A rotavirus strains circulating among Japanese 
cattle. No other diarrhea pathogen of adult cattle was detected by routine 
diagnosis and metagenomics. Viral metagenomics, using a next-generation 
sequencer, is useful to characterize group A rotaviruses from fecal samples and 
offers unbiased comprehensive investigations of pathogen.

A novel virus related to the Enterovirus/Sapelovirus supergroup in the family 
Picornaviridae was identified in healthy porcine feces in Japan by using a 
metagenomics approach. The genome of the virus, named Sapelo-like porcine 
picornavirus Japan (SPPVJ) Pig/Isi-Im1/JPN/2016, had a type-IV internal 
ribosomal entry site and carried a 6978-nucleotide-long single open reading 
frame encoding a 2326 amino acids (aa) polyprotein precursor. The coding 
sequence region consisted of leader protein (68 aa), a structural protein region 
P1 (824 aa), and the non-structural protein regions P2 (672 aa) and P3 (762 aa). 
Among representative picornaviruses, the P1, 2C, and 3CD regions of SPPVJ had 
the highest aa identities of 64.4%, 61.9%, and 73.3%, respectively, with the 
corresponding regions of sapelo-like bat picornavirus BtVs-PicoV/SC2013. 
Sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR products derived from the 5' untranslated and 
3D regions revealed the presence of SPPVJ in 17.8% (19/107) of the feces from 
healthy and diarrheal pigs in 12 farms in 2015-2016. Further studies are needed 
to determine the origin and pathogenic potential of SPPJV in pigs and other 
mammals.

BACKGROUND: Transgenic gpt delta mouse and rat models were developed to perform 
gpt and Spi(-) assays for in vivo mutagenicity tests. The animals were 
established by integration of lambda EG10 phage DNA as a transgene into the 
genome. The inserted position of the transgene on chromosome was determined by 
fluorescent in situ hybridization and Southern blot analyses; however, the exact 
position and sequence of the inserted junction were not known. To identify the 
site and pattern of genomic integration of the transgene copies, genomic DNAs 
extracted from C57BL/6J gpt delta mice and F344 gpt delta rats were applied to 
whole genome sequencing and mate-pair analysis.
RESULTS: The result confirmed that multi-copy lambda EG10 transgenes are 
inserted at a single position in the mouse chromosome 17. The junction contains 
70 bp of overlapped genomic sequences, and it has short homology at both ends. A 
copy number analysis suggested that the inserted transgenes may contain 41 
head-to-tail junctions and 16 junctions of other types such as rearranged 
abnormal junctions. It suggested that the number of intact copies could be 
approximately 40 at maximum. In the F344 gpt delta rats, transgenes are inserted 
at a single position in the rat chromosome 4. The junction contains no 
overlapped sequence but 72-kb genomic sequence including one gene was deleted. 
The inserted transgenes may contain 15 head-to-tail junctions and two rearranged 
junctions. It suggested that the number of intact copies could be 14 at maximum. 
One germline base substitution in the gpt gene rescued from gpt delta rats was 
characterized.
CONCLUSIONS: The exact inserted positions of the lambda EG10 transgene in the 
genome of gpt delta transgenic rodents were identified. The copy number and 
arrangement of the transgene were analyzed. PCR primers for quick genotyping of 
gpt delta mice and rats have been designed.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of 
circoviruses in wild bird populations, in Poland. Circoviruses possess 
immuno-suppressive properties and might interfere with the health of wild birds.
METHOD: 83 birds, which belonged to 23 species, were tested with broad-range, 
nested PCR. The obtained PCR products were sequenced and new primers designed, 
to analyse the full-length, viral genome. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted, 
to find any relationship to known circoviruses.
RESULTS: The circovirus DNA sequence was found in 4 birds. All samples 
originated from the velvet scoter (Melanitta fusca) a marine duck from the 
Merginae sub-family. Birds which tested positive for the circovirus were found 
dead in fishing nets, off the Baltic coast. During post-mortem examination, 
carcasses of two of the scoters showed only light emaciation, while the two 
other birds appeared healthy. The obtained, full-length, circovirus sequence 
revealed 1,988 nucleotides and the presence of typical features (i.e. Cap, Rep 
and ORF3). Nucleotide similarity to other duck circoviruses was 84 to 86 %. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome and cap gene, indicated that the 
new circovirus is related to known duck circoviruses, especially to sub-types 
sometimes referred to as duck circovirus genotype 1, but not genotype 2.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have reported a new duck circovirus sequence 
detected in the velvet scoter, a species of marine duck. Sequence comparison and 
phylogenetic analysis of the new virus sequence support previous reports that 
duck circovirus (DuCV) is a species with a high degree of diversity. The viral 
sequence obtained from the velvet scoter suggests that DuCV may infect birds 
from the Anatinae sub-family. More studies are needed to prove if the velvet 
scoter and other marine ducks act as a reservoir for DuCV.

B-cell epitopes of African horse sickness virus serotype 4 recognised by immune horse sera,"<jats:p>Identifying antigenic proteins and mapping their epitopes is important for the development of diagnostic reagents and recombinant vaccines. B-cell epitopes of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) have previously been mapped on VP2, VP5, VP7 and NS1, using mouse, rabbit and chicken monoclonal antibodies. A comprehensive study of the humoral immune response of five vaccinated horses to AHSV-4 antigenic peptides was undertaken. A fragmented-genome phage display library expressing a repertoire of AHSV-4 peptides spanning the entire genome was constructed. The library was affinity selected for binders on immobilised polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from horse sera collected pre- and post-immunisation with an attenuated AHSV-4 monovalent vaccine. The DNA inserts of binding phages were sequenced with Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The data were normalised using preimmune IgG-selected sequences. More sequences mapped to the genes coding for NS3, VP6 and VP5 than to the other genes. However, VP2 and VP5 each had more antigenic regions than each of the other proteins. This study identified a number of epitopes to which the horse’s humoral immune system responds during immunisation with AHSV-4.</jats:p>",0
Human parvovirus 4 ‘PARV4’ remains elusive despite a decade of study,"<ns4:p>Human parvovirus 4 (‘PARV4’) is a small DNA tetraparvovirus, first reported in 2005. In some populations, PARV4 infection is uncommon, and evidence of exposure is found only in individuals with risk factors for parenteral infection who are infected with other blood-borne viruses. In other settings, seroprevalence studies suggest an endemic, age-associated transmission pattern, independent of any specific risk factors. The clinical impact of PARV4 infection remains uncertain, but reported disease associations include an influenza-like syndrome, encephalitis, acceleration of HIV disease, and foetal hydrops. In this review, we set out to report progress updates from the recent literature, focusing on the investigation of cohorts in different geographical settings, now including insights from Asia, the Middle East, and South America, and discussing whether attributes of viral or host populations underpin the striking differences in epidemiology. We review progress in understanding viral phylogeny and biology, approaches to diagnostics, and insights that might be gained from studies of closely related animal pathogens. Crucial questions about pathogenicity remain unanswered, but we highlight new evidence supporting a possible link between PARV4 and an encephalitis syndrome. The unequivocal evidence that PARV4 is endemic in certain populations should drive ongoing research efforts to understand risk factors and routes of transmission and to gain new insights into the impact of this virus on human health.</ns4:p>",0
Full Genome-Based Classification of Rotaviruses Reveals a Common Origin between Human Wa-Like and Porcine Rotavirus Strains and Human DS-1-Like and Bovine Rotavirus Strains,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Group A rotavirus classification is currently based on the molecular properties of the two outer layer proteins, VP7 and VP4, and the middle layer protein, VP6. As reassortment of all the 11 rotavirus gene segments plays a key role in generating rotavirus diversity in nature, a classification system that is based on all the rotavirus gene segments is desirable for determining which genes influence rotavirus host range restriction, replication, and virulence, as well as for studying rotavirus epidemiology and evolution. Toward establishing such a classification system, gene sequences encoding VP1 to VP3, VP6, and NSP1 to NSP5 were determined for human and animal rotavirus strains belonging to different G and P genotypes in addition to those available in databases, and they were used to define phylogenetic relationships among all rotavirus genes. Based on these phylogenetic analyses, appropriate identity cutoff values were determined for each gene. For the VP4 gene, a nucleotide identity cutoff value of 80% completely correlated with the 27 established P genotypes. For the VP7 gene, a nucleotide identity cutoff value of 80% largely coincided with the established G genotypes but identified four additional distinct genotypes comprised of murine or avian rotavirus strains. Phylogenetic analyses of the VP1 to VP3, VP6, and NSP1 to NSP5 genes showed the existence of 4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 5, 7, 11, and 6 genotypes, respectively, based on nucleotide identity cutoff values of 83%, 84%, 81%, 85%, 79%, 85%, 85%, 85%, and 91%, respectively. In accordance with these data, a revised nomenclature of rotavirus strains is proposed. The novel classification system allows the identification of (i) distinct genotypes, which probably followed separate evolutionary paths; (ii) interspecies transmissions and a plethora of reassortment events; and (iii) certain gene constellations that revealed (a) a common origin between human Wa-like rotavirus strains and porcine rotavirus strains and (b) a common origin between human DS-1-like rotavirus strains and bovine rotaviruses. These close evolutionary links between human and animal rotaviruses emphasize the need for close simultaneous monitoring of rotaviruses in animals and humans.</jats:p>",0
Complete molecular genome analyses of equine rotavirus A strains from different continents reveal several novel genotypes and a largely conserved genotype constellation,"<jats:p>In this study, the complete genome sequences of seven equine group A rotavirus (RVA) strains (RVA/Horse-tc/GBR/L338/1991/G13P[18], RVA/Horse-wt/IRL/03V04954/2003/G3P[12] and RVA/Horse-wt/IRL/04V2024/2004/G14P[12] from Europe; RVA/Horse-wt/ARG/E30/1993/G3P[12], RVA/Horse-wt/ARG/E403/2006/G14P[12] and RVA/Horse-wt/ARG/E4040/2008/G14P[12] from Argentina; and RVA/Horse-wt/ZAF/EqRV-SA1/2006/G14P[12] from South Africa) were determined. Multiple novel genotypes were identified and genotype numbers were assigned by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group: R9 (VP1), C9 (VP2), N9 (NSP2), T12 (NSP3), E14 (NSP4), and H7 and H11 (NSP5). The genotype constellation of L338 was unique: G13-P[18]-I6-R9-C9-M6-A6-N9-T12-E14-H11. The six remaining equine RVA strains showed a largely conserved genotype constellation: G3/G14-P[12]-I2/I6-R2-C2-M3-A10-N2-T3-E2/E12-H7, which is highly divergent from other known non-equine RVA genotype constellations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the sequences of these equine RVA strains are related distantly to non-equine RVA strains, and that at least three lineages exist within equine RVA strains. A small number of reassortment events were observed. Interestingly, the three RVA strains from Argentina possessed the E12 genotype, whereas the three RVA strains from Ireland and South Africa possessed the E2 genotype.

This conserved genetic configuration of equine RVA strains could be useful for future vaccine development or improvement of currently used equine RVA vaccines.</jats:p>",0
Cowpox virus: What’s in a Name?,"<jats:p>Traditionally, virus taxonomy relied on phenotypic properties; however, a sequence-based virus taxonomy has become essential since the recent requirement of a species to exhibit monophyly. The species Cowpox virus has failed to meet this requirement, necessitating a reexamination of this species. Here, we report the genomic sequences of nine Cowpox viruses and, by combining them with the available data of 37 additional genomes, confirm polyphyly of Cowpox viruses and find statistical support based on genetic data for more than a dozen species. These results are discussed in light of the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses species definition, as well as immediate and future implications for poxvirus taxonomic classification schemes. Data support the recognition of five monophyletic clades of Cowpox viruses as valid species.</jats:p>",0

In the case of Newcastle disease virus, multiple factors such as host 
adaptation, immune response evasion, and selective pressures have been suggested 
to result in evolution of viruses and the emergence of genetic variants. 
Multiple studies on virus classification and global epidemiological links have 
yielded consistent data. Here, we have performed a molecular analysis study of 
circulating Newcastle disease viruses in Iran (1995-2016). According to 
evolutionary divergences, subgenotype VIg, VIj, VIIj, VIId, XIIIa and XIIId 
isolates have been circulating in the country during a 21-year period. Based on 
data analysis, VIg isolates shared highest sequence identity with Russian and 
Polish isolates of the VIg subgenotype, while VIj subgenotype isolates (2012) 
were most similar to a virus isolated in 2015 in India. Analysis of the 
evolutionary divergence of subgenotype VIIj suggests that Chinese and Ukrainian 
viruses may have played a crucial role in the emergence of VIIj isolates. 
Evolutionary difference studies also indicated that XIIIa isolates circulating 
in Iran may have caused the emergence of adapted variants of subgenotype XIIId. 
Therefore, we propose that the evolutionary and epidemiological study of 
virulent Newcastle disease viruses could help to provide accurate molecular data 
about variants circulating in the region, thus aiding in the design of more 
efficient recombinant vaccines.

Interruption of cytokine networks by poxviruses: lessons from myxoma virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Myxoma virus is an infectious poxvirus pathogen that induces a virulent systemic disease called myxomatosis in European rabbits. The disease is rapidly and uniformly fatal to susceptible rabbits and is characterized by generalized dysfunction of cellular immunity and multiple interruptions of the host cytokine network. A number of virus genes are classified as virulence factors because virus constructs bearing targeted gene disruptions induce attenuated disease symptoms. Many of these genes encode proteins that interact directly with effector elements of the host immune system. Included among these immunosubversive viral proteins are secreted mimics of host ligands or regulators (virokines) and homologues of cellular cytokine receptors (viroceptors). Five examples of these immune modulator proteins encoded by myxoma virus are reviewed: (1) myxoma growth factor, a member of the epidermal growth factor ligand superfamily; (2) SERP-1, a secreted serine proteinase inhibitor; (3) M11L, a receptor-like surface protein; (4) T2, a tumor necrosis factor receptor homologue; and (5) T7, an interferon-γ receptor homologue. The origin of viral strategies designed to subvert immune regulation by host cytokines is considered in the context of the biology of myxoma virus within immunocompetent hosts. J. Leukoc.

University, Christchurch, 7647, New Zealand.

Four new infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains (T6, K32, K43, and K87) were 
isolated from clinically infected chickens in New Zealand. These strains were 
compared with four strains (A, B, C, and D), which had circulated 25 years 
previously, by sequencing the gene coding for the S1 subunit of the spike 
glycoprotein. Analysis of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences 
revealed that the eight strains from New Zealand are genetically related and 
share greater than 82.8% nucleotide and 79% amino acid homology within the S1 
region. Strains T6, K43, and K87 were more than 99% homologous to previously 
described strains C and D. A fourth new strain (K32) was most closely related to 
the previously described B strain. Phylogenetic analysis of strains revealed 
that New Zealand strains were more closely related to Australian than European 
or North American strains. The New Zealand A strain shared 99.5% nucleotide and 
98.7% amino acid homology with the Australian Vic S strain. Deduced amino acid 
sequence of the S1 glycoprotein indicated differences between strains that were, 
in general, consistent with virus neutralization patterns.

Canine distemper virus infection in a lesser grison (Galictis cuja): first report and virus phylogeny,"<jats:p>Infectious diseases in wild animals have been increasing as a result of their habitat alterations and closer contact with domestic animals. Canine distemper virus (CDV) has been reported in several species of wild carnivores, presenting a threat to wildlife conservation. We described the first case of canine distemper virus infection in lesser grison (Galictis cuja). A free-ranging individual, with no visible clinical sigs, presented sudden death after one day in captivity. Molecular diagnosis for CDV infection was performed using whole blood collected by postmortem intracardiac puncture, which resulted positive. The virus phylogeny indicated that domestic dogs were the probable source of infection.</jats:p>",0

The influenza D virus, a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, is 
predominantly found in cattle. Although viral pathology and clinical disease in 
cattle appear mild, this virus plays an important role as a trigger of bovine 
respiratory disease (BRD). BRD is a costly illness worldwide. Thus, 
epidemiological surveys of the influenza D virus are necessary. Here, we 
conducted a molecular epidemiological survey for the influenza D virus in 
healthy and respiratory-diseased cattle in Japan. We found that 2.1% (8/377) of 
the cattle were infected with influenza D. The cattle with and without 
respiratory symptoms had approximately equal amounts of the virus. A full-genome 
sequence analysis revealed that the influenza D virus that was isolated in Japan 
formed an individual cluster that was distinct from the strains found in other 
countries. These results suggest that this virus might have evolved uniquely in 
Japan over a long period of time and that the viral pathology of Japanese 
strains might be different from the strains found in other countries. Continuous 
surveillance is required to determine the importance of this virus and to 
characterize its evolution.

The history of the enteroviruses is described, and how poliovirus came to be 
recognized as the prototype species of the genus, a subdivision of the family 
Picornaviridae. Albert Sabin was one of the main contributors. He isolated 
several enterovirus types and established them as causative agents of human 
disease. The enteroviruses were discovered only after new methods were 
introduced for working with viruses. They are now recognized as constituting one 
of the genera of the picornavirus family. Pico-rna-virus stands for viruses 
which are small (pico), and have an RNA genome. The enterovirus genus includes 
the polioviruses, the coxsackieviruses and the echoviruses of humans, plus a 
number of enteroviruses of lower animals (e.g., monkeys, cattle, pigs, mice). 
Over 100 serotypes are now recognized, the first having been the polioviruses.

Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are recognized as causal agents of benign and 
malignant tumors in cattle. Thirteen types of BPVs have already been described 
and classified into 3 distinct genera. Divergences in the nucleotide sequence of 
the L1 gene are used to identify new viral types through the employment of PCR 
assays with degenerated primers. In the present study, a method for identifying 
BPVs based on PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing allowed the identification of a new 
putative Deltapapillomavirus, designated JN/3SP (JQ280500.1). The analysis of 
the L1 gene showed that this strain was most closely related to the BPVs -1, -2, 
-13 , and OaPV1 (71-73% genetic similarity). In this study, we describe the 
detection of this new putative Deltapapillomavirus type and verify its 
phylogenetic position within the genus.

Sciences, 518 Ziyue Road, Shanghai 200241, People's Republic of China.

A lentogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Duck/JS/10 (JS10), was isolated from 
an unvaccinated duck in China. The complete genome of the virus contained 15,198 
nucleotides. Based on length of the genome and a partial sequence of the F gene, 
the virus was classified as a class I genotype 4 NDV. The antigenicity of the 
virus was compared with that of NDV strain La Sota via hemagglutination 
inhibition (HI), virus neutralization (VN) assay and animal experiments. Our 
results show that JS10 generates higher HI and VN titers than La Sota against 
both class I and II virulent NDV strains. Experiments on animals demonstrate 
that virus shedding from chickens vaccinated with JS10 is significantly reduced 
when compared to those vaccinated with La Sota. Overall, this study strongly 
suggests that JS10 may qualify as a new vaccine candidate against Newcastle 
disease.

Newcastle disease (ND), caused by ND virus (NDV), is one of the most infectious 
and economically important diseases of the poultry industry worldwide. While 
infections are reported in a wide range of avian species, the pathogenicity of 
chicken-origin virulent NDV isolates in ducks remains elusive. In this study, 
two NDV strains were isolated and biologically and genetically characterized 
from an outbreak in chickens and apparently healthy ducks. Pathogenicity 
assessment indices, including the mean death time (MDT), intracerebral 
pathogenicity index (ICPI) and cleavage motifs in the fusion (F) protein, 
indicated that both isolates were velogenic in nature. While these isolates 
carried pathogenic characteristics, interestingly they showed differential 
pathogenicity in ducks. The chicken-origin isolate caused high (70%) mortality, 
whereas the duck-origin virus resulted in low (20%) mortality in 4-week-old 
ducks. Intriguingly, both isolates showed comparable disease pathologies in 
chickens. Full-genome sequence analysis showed that the virus genome contains 
15 192 nucleotides and carried features that are characteristic of velogenic 
strains of NDV. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that both isolates clustered in 
class II and genotype VII. However, there were several mutations in the 
functionally important regions of the fusion (F) and 
haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins, which may be responsible for the 
differential pathogenicity of these viruses in ducks. In summary, these results 
suggest that NDV strains with the same genotype show differential pathogenicity 
in chickens and ducks. Furthermore, chicken-origin virulent NDVs are more 
pathogenic for ducks than duck-origin viruses. These findings propose a role for 
chickens in the evolution of viral pathogenicity and the potential genetic 
resistance of ducks to poultry viruses.

Ticks are implicated in the transmission of various human and livestock 
pathogens worldwide. This study aimed to understand the geographical 
distribution of tick species, along with tick-associated viruses, in 
Heilongjiang Province, northeast China. Molecular methods were used to classify 
tick species, with next-generation sequencing and polymerase chain 
reaction-based analyses used to assess the viromes of ticks from four 
representative sampling locations in the Greater Khingan Mountains. Five species 
of ixodid ticks were identified, including Ixodes persulcatus, Dermacentor 
nuttalli, Dermacentor silvarum, Haemaphysalis longicornis, and Haemaphysalis 
concinna. From the 1102 ticks, 3,568,561 high-quality reads were obtained by 
next-generation sequencing. Following trimming, 302,540 reads were obtained, of 
which 6577 (2.16%) reads were annotated to viruses. Phylogenetic analysis 
revealed that the viral sequences shared a close relationship with 
Orthonairovirus, Phlebovirus, deer tick Mononegavirales-like virus, and Jingmen 
tick virus sequences, but the significance of these newly-identified tick-borne 
viruses to human and animal health requires further investigation. The results 
of this study provide a basis not only for further studies on the relationship 
between ticks and tick-borne viruses, but also for preventing future tick-borne 
epidemic outbreaks by means of vector control.

BACKGROUND: In spite of the purification of the laying hens and broilers of 
avian leukosis virus (ALV) has made remarkable achievements, the infection of 
ALV was still serious in Chinese indigenous chickens.
METHODS: In order to assess the epidemic state of avian leukosis virus in 
indigenous chickens in China, 10 novel strains of ALV subgroup J (ALV-J), named 
JS16JH01 to JS16JH10, were isolated and identified by virus isolation and 
immunofluorescence antibody assays from a Chinese local breed farm with a 
sporadic incidence of tumors. To understand their virological characteristics 
further, the proviral genome of ENV-LTR was sequenced and compared with the 
reference strains.
RESULTS: The homology of the gp85 gene between the ten ALV-J strains and NX0101 
was in the range from 89.7-94.8% at the nuclear acid level. In addition, their 
gp85 genes were quite varied, with identities of 92-98% with themselves at the 
nuclear acid level. There were several snp and indel sites in the amino acid 
sequence of gp85 genes after comparison with other reference strains of ALV. 
Interestingly, a novel insertion in the gp85 region was found in two strains, 
JS16JH01 and JS16JH07, compared with NX0101 and HPRS-103.
DISCUSSION: At present, owing to the large-scale purification of ALV in China, 
laying hens and broiler chickens with ALV infection are rarely detected, but 
ALVs are still frequently detected in the local chickens, which suggests that 
more efforts should be applied to the purification of ALV from indigenous 
chickens.

Velogenic Newcastle disease has threatened the Mexican poultry industry since 
1946. Seven strains of velogenic Newcastle disease virus were isolated from 
poultry and other avian species in central and northern Mexico from 1998 to 2006 
and subjected to phylogenetic analysis and biological characterization using 
standard pathogenicity tests and challenge studies. Phylogenetic analysis showed 
that all velogenic strains belonged to genetic group V and are clearly divided 
in two lineages, since phylogenetic similarities between groups are of only 
93-94%. Isolates from 1998 to 2001 are closely related to the strain responsible 
for the 2000 year outbreak raised in La Laguna region (Torreon strain), and are 
phylogenetically distinct from viruses isolated between 2004 and 2006 that are 
genetically related to the Chimalhuacan strain isolated in 1973. All the viruses 
of both, the Chimalhuacan and the Torreon groups, contained a virulent fusion 
protein cleavage site represented by the motif ""GGRRQKRF"", revealing that 
evolutionary changes occurred at a different site. Chicken embryo mean death 
time value was shorter for the Chimalhuacan-like viruses (43.9 hours), when 
compared with the 1998-2001 average (54.3 hours). ICPI average value was higher 
(1.92) for viruses isolated during 2004-2006 than that for viruses isolated 
before 2001 (1.74). Microscopic evaluation of bursa of Fabricius and thymus of 
5w-o broiler chickens challenged with 10⁶ LD₅₀/0.2 ml showed that 
Chimalhuacan-like isolate caused more severe lesions at 48 hpi in bursa and 72 
and 96 hpi in thymus than Torreon-like isolate. Along with the MDT, ICPI and 
microscopic results, our findings suggest that some distinct selective pressure 
on the very virulent Chimalhuacan strain isolated in early 1970's may have led 
to the appearance of the still velogenic but less virulent new group 
(Torreon-like) in the middle of 1990's.

The history of virology is a history of conceptual and technological inventions 
and breakthroughs. The development of filters made of porcelain or kieselgur by 
the end of the 19th century which withheld bacteria allowed the identification 
of infectious agents smaller than bacteria and noncultivable on the media known 
at that time and used to grow bacteria. Even finer-grain filters resulted in the 
observation that the ultravisible novel infectious agents are in fact of 
particulate nature. Infections of plants and animals were the first to be 
attributed to these tiny entities. Proof resulted from experimental infection of 
the natural hosts (including humans). Thus, of the first 30 viruses identified, 
20 are veterinary viruses, i.e. infectious agents of poultry and livestock. The 
discovery that bacteria also have viruses in the 1910s expanded the viral 
universe which continues today. Filterability and ultravisibility remained a 
hallmark for the identification of viruses until the advent of the electron 
microscope in the late 1930s marking another technological breakthrough in 
virology. Cell culture techniques allowed virus propagation outside the infected 
organism. In the past decades, the advent and development of molecular biology 
has brought more innovations culminating in the rapid and accurate determination 
of genomic material of a variety of living beings including viruses in a 
hitherto unknown speed and depth using next-generation sequencing and 
metagenomic analyses. Thus, it is no surprise that new viruses are detected 
constantly including specimens of unprecedented size and shape. Virologists 
agree that the viral universe is immense, and only a small fraction has been 
explored yet.

Characterization of proteins encoded by ORFs 2 to 7 of Lelystad virus,"1. Virology. 1995 Jan 10;206(1):155-63. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(95)80030-1.

The genome of Lelystad virus (LV), a positive-strand RNA virus, is 15 kb in 
length and contains 8 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode putative viral 
proteins. ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned in plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA 
polymerase promoter, and the translation of transcripts generated in vitro 
yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. 
Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid 
sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were raised in rabbits. Antisera 
that immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7 
were obtained. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORFs 3 
to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the 
immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and porcine 
anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their 
corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 
kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated 
membrane protein of 25 kDa (E). The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein 
is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The E protein in virus 
particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to 
endo-beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase H. This finding indicates that the 
high-mannose glycans are processed into complex glycans in the Golgi 
compartment. The protein composition of the LV virions further confirms that LV 
is evolutionarily related to equine arteritis virus, simian hemorrhagic fever 
virus, and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.

Fourteen orthopoxvirus strains isolated from humans, cats, a dog, a cow, and an 
elephant in Germany were characterized. All were classified as cowpox virus 
based on haemorrhagic lesions induced on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken 
eggs and reactivity of a 160 kDa protein with anti-A-type inclusion protein 
hyperimmune serum in a Western blot. More detailed comparison of the isolates by 
restriction endonuclease mapping using HindIII and XhoI demonstrated a close 
relationship between all isolates and confirmed them as cowpox viruses. However, 
some minor differences between the isolates were detected which proved to be of 
epidemiological value. One group consisting of five closely related isolates 
contained a unique 4.0 kb HindIII fragment. In a Southern blot this fragment 
failed to hybridize with other cowpox virus isolates including the reference 
strain.

African swine fever (ASF) is a highly lethal disease of domestic pigs caused by 
the only known DNA arbovirus. It was first described in Kenya in 1921 and since 
then many isolates have been collected worldwide. However, although several 
phylogenetic studies have been carried out to understand the relationships 
between the isolates, no molecular dating analyses have been achieved so far. In 
this paper, comprehensive phylogenetic reconstructions were made using newly 
generated, publicly available sequences of hundreds of ASFV isolates from the 
past 70 years. Analyses focused on B646L, CP204L, and E183L genes from 356, 251, 
and 123 isolates, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses were achieved using 
maximum likelihood and Bayesian coalescence methods. A new lineage-based 
nomenclature is proposed to designate 35 different clusters. In addition, dating 
of ASFV origin was carried out from the molecular data sets. To avoid bias, 
diversity due to positive selection or recombination events was neutralized. The 
molecular clock analyses revealed that ASFV strains currently circulating have 
evolved over 300 years, with a time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) 
in the early 18(th) century.

Next-generation sequencing is a new research tool in our hands helping us to 
explore still unknown fields of human and veterinary virology. Metagenomic 
analysis has enabled the discovery of putative novel pathogens and the 
identification of the etiologic agents of several diseases, solving 
long-standing mysteries caused by divergent viruses. This approach has been used 
in several studies investigating fecal samples of livestock, and companion 
animal species, providing information on the diversity of animal fecal virome, 
helping the elucidation of the etiology of diarrheal disease in animals and 
identifying potential zoonotic and emerging viruses.

"Nyamanini and Midway Viruses Define a Novel Taxon of RNA Viruses in the Order
            <i>Mononegavirales</i>","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Here, we report the sequencing and classification of Nyamanini virus (NYMV) and Midway virus (MIDWV), two antigenically related viruses that were first isolated in 1957 and 1966, respectively. Although these viruses have been cultured multiple times from cattle egrets, seabirds, and their ticks, efforts to classify them taxonomically using conventional serological and electron microscopic approaches have failed completely. We used a random shotgun sequencing strategy to define the genomes of NYMV and MIDWV. Contigs of 11,631 and 11,752 nucleotides, representing the complete genome of NYMV and the near-complete genome of MIDWV, respectively, were assembled. Each virus genome was predicted to carry six open reading frames (ORFs). BLAST analysis indicated that only two of the ORF proteins of each virus, the putative nucleocapsid and polymerase, had detectable sequence similarity to known viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of these ORF proteins demonstrated that the closest relatives of NYNV and MIDWV are negative-stranded-RNA viruses in the order
            <jats:italic>Mononegavirales</jats:italic>
            . On the basis of their very limited sequence similarity to known viruses, we propose that NYMV and MIDWV define a novel genus,

A first look at the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Oxford Nanopore's third‐generation single‐molecule sequencing platform promises to decrease costs for reagents and instrumentation. After a 2‐year hiatus following the initial announcement, the first devices have been released as part of an early access program. We explore the performance of this platform by resequencing the lambda phage genome, and amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the handheld Min<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ION</jats:styled-content> sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting reads map to the reference, with less than average 10% identity. Much of the sequence consists of insertion/deletion errors, or is seemingly without similarity to the template. Using the lambda phage data as an example, although the reads are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 ± 1932 bases per mapped read could be matched to the reference without soft clipping. In the course of a 36 h run on the MinION, it was possible to resequence the 48 kb lambda phage reference at 16× coverage. Currently, substantially larger projects would not be feasible using the Min<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ION</jats:styled-content>. Without increases in accuracy, which would be required for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, the current utility of the Min<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ION</jats:styled-content> appears limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory, and is of similar complexity and cost to that of other next‐generation sequencing platforms. The Min<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ION</jats:styled-content> is an exciting step in a new direction for single‐molecule sequencing, though it will require dramatic decreases in error rates before it lives up to its promise.</jats:p>",0

Newcastle disease: evolution of genotypes and the related diagnostic challenges.

Research Laboratory, 934 College Station Road, Athens, GA 30052, USA.

Since the discovery of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in 1926, nine genotypes of 
class I viruses and ten of class II have been identified, representing a diverse 
and continually evolving group of viruses. The emergence of new virulent 
genotypes from global epizootics and the year-to-year changes observed in the 
genomic sequence of NDV of low and high virulence implies that distinct 
genotypes of NDV are simultaneously evolving at different geographic locations 
across the globe. This vast genomic diversity may be favored by the large 
variety of avian species susceptible to NDV infection and by the availability of 
highly mobile wild bird reservoirs. The genomic diversity of NDV increases the 
possibility of diagnostic failures, resulting in unidentified infections. 
Constant epidemiological surveillance and pro-active characterization of 
circulating strains are needed to ensure that the immunological and PCR reagents 
are effective in identifying NDV circulating worldwide. For example, in the 
United States, the widely used real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RRT-PCR) matrix gene assay for the identification of NDV often fails 
to detect low virulence APMV-1 from waterfowl, while the RRT-PCR fusion gene 
assay, used to identify virulent isolates, often fails to detect certain 
virulent NDV genotypes. A new matrix-polymerase multiplex test that detects most 
of the viruses currently circulating worldwide and a modified fusion test for 
the identification of virulent pigeon viruses circulating in the U.S. and Europe 
have recently been developed. For newly isolated viruses with unknown sequences, 
recently developed random priming sequencing methods need to be incorporated 
into the diagnostic arsenal. In addition, the current system of classifying NDV 
into genotypes or lineages is inadequate. Here, we review the molecular 
epidemiology and recent diagnostic problems related to viral evolution of NDV 
and explain why a new system, based on objective criteria, is needed to 
categorize genotypes.

Common evolutionary origin of hepatitis B virus and retroviruses.,"<jats:p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV), although classified as a double-stranded DNA virus, has been shown recently to replicate by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Also, the putative viral polymerase has been found to share amino acid homology with reverse transcriptase of retroviruses. Using computer-assisted DNA and protein sequence analyses, we examined the genomes of 13 hepadnavirus isolates (nine human, two duck, one woodchuck, and one ground squirrel) and found that other conserved regions of the hepadnavirus genome share homology to corresponding regions of the genomes of type C retroviruses and retrovirus-like endogenous human DNA elements. Specifically, the most highly conserved sequence of the HBV genome, positioned at or near the initiation site for first-strand HBV DNA synthesis, is homologous over 67 nucleotides to the U5 region, a comparable region in retrovirus long terminal repeats. Within a highly conserved (i.e., 90%) 16-nucleotide sequence a heptanucleotide sequence CCTTGGG is 97% homologous between 27 virus isolates. Also, we found that the highly conserved HBV core, or nucleocapsid, protein shares 41% homology over 98 amino acids with the carboxyl-terminal region of the p30 gag nucleocapsid protein of type C retroviruses. In both cases, as with the previously reported polymerase homology, HBV is most homologous to the murine leukemia/sarcoma retroviruses. Further analysis revealed additional similarities between hepadnavirus and retroviral genomes. Taken together, our results suggest that HBV and retroviruses have a common evolutionary origin, with HBV arising through a process of deletion from a retrovirus, or retrovirus-like, progenitor.</jats:p>",0

We investigated the sensitivity of human rotavirus rapid antigen detection (RAD) 
kits, RT-PCR and next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) for detection of bovine 
group A rotavirus (RVA). The Dipstick 'Eiken' Rota (Dipstick) showed the highest 
sensitivity out of the seven RAD kits against all selected strains in limited 
dilution analyses, which was consistent with the results for equine rotavirus 
previously reported. RT-PCR had 10⁰-10³-fold higher sensitivity than the 
Dipstick. NGS using thirteen RT-PCR-negative fecal samples revealed that all 
samples yielded RVA reads and especially that two of them covered all 11 genome 
segments. Moreover, mapping reads to reference sequences allowed genotyping. The 
NGS would be sensitive and useful for analysis of less dependent on specific 
primers and screening of genotypes.

A Systematic Review of the Natural Virome of Anopheles Mosquitoes,"<jats:p>Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors of human malaria, but they also harbor viruses, collectively termed the virome. The Anopheles virome is relatively poorly studied, and the number and function of viruses are unknown. Only the o’nyong-nyong arbovirus (ONNV) is known to be consistently transmitted to vertebrates by Anopheles mosquitoes. A systematic literature review searched four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Lissa. In addition, online and print resources were searched manually. The searches yielded 259 records. After screening for eligibility criteria, we found at least 51 viruses reported in Anopheles, including viruses with potential to cause febrile disease if transmitted to humans or other vertebrates. Studies to date have not provided evidence that Anopheles consistently transmit and maintain arboviruses other than ONNV. However, anthropophilic Anopheles vectors of malaria are constantly exposed to arboviruses in human bloodmeals. It is possible that in malaria-endemic zones, febrile symptoms may be commonly misdiagnosed. It is also possible that anophelines may be inherently less competent arbovirus vectors than culicines, but if true, the biological basis would warrant further study. This systematic review contributes a context to characterize the biology, knowledge gaps, and potential public health risk of Anopheles viruses.</jats:p>",0
Rapid evolution of the human gut virome,"<jats:p>
            Humans are colonized by immense populations of viruses, which metagenomic analysis shows are mostly unique to each individual. To investigate the origin and evolution of the human gut virome, we analyzed the viral community of one adult individual over 2.5 y by extremely deep metagenomic sequencing (56 billion bases of purified viral sequence from 24 longitudinal fecal samples). After assembly, 478 well-determined contigs could be identified, which are inferred to correspond mostly to previously unstudied bacteriophage genomes. Fully 80% of these types persisted throughout the duration of the 2.5-y study, indicating long-term global stability. Mechanisms of base substitution, rates of accumulation, and the amount of variation varied among viral types. Temperate phages showed relatively lower mutation rates, consistent with replication by accurate bacterial DNA polymerases in the integrated prophage state. In contrast, Microviridae, which are lytic bacteriophages with single-stranded circular DNA genomes, showed high substitution rates (&gt;10
            <jats:sup>−5</jats:sup>
            per nucleotide each day), so that sequence divergence over the 2.5-y period studied approached values sufficient to distinguish new viral species. Longitudinal changes also were associated with diversity-generating retroelements and virus-encoded Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats arrays. We infer that the extreme interpersonal diversity of human gut viruses derives from two sources, persistence of a small portion of the global virome within the gut of each individual and rapid evolution of some long-term virome members.

Human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is a cause of seasonal epidemics of hand, foot and 
mouth disease, and of less common but severe neurological manifestations. 
Uncertainty persists regarding the circulation of virus populations in several 
geographical areas and the timescale of their dissemination. We determined EV-71 
sequences at loci 1D (VP1 capsid protein) and 3CD (non-structural proteins) in 
86 strains recovered in Austria, France and Germany and performed an 
evolutionary genetic study of extant virus populations. Phylogenetic analyses 
positioned 78 of the 86 sequences within two clades among subgenogroups C1 and 
C2. A minor sequence cluster was assigned to subgenogroup C4. Analyses 
incorporating the available sequences estimated the substitution rate in 
genogroup C at 3.66 x 10(-3) and 4.46 x 10(-3) substitutions per site year(-1) 
for loci 1D and 3CD, respectively, assuming a relaxed molecular-clock model for 
sequence evolution. Most of the 'European' strains belonged to clades C1b and 
C2b, which originated in 1994 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 1992.7-1995.8] and 
2002 (95 % CI, 2001.6-2003.8), respectively. Estimates of divergence times for 
locus 3CD were consistent with those measured for locus 1D. Intertwining between 
clades representing EV-71 subgenogroups and clades corresponding to other 
enterovirus types (notably early coxsackievirus A prototype strains) in the 3CD 
phylogeny is highly indicative of ancestral recombination events. Incongruent 
phylogenetic patterns estimated for loci 1D and 3CD show that a single tree 
cannot model the epidemic history of circulating EV-71 populations. The 
evolutionary timescale of genogroup C estimated for both loci was measured only 
in decades, indicating recent dissemination.

Genetic diversity of bovine diarrhea and mucosal disease virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified as a member of the <jats:italic>Pestivirus</jats:italic> genus of the <jats:italic>Flaviviridae</jats:italic> family. BVDV is one of the most important viral pathogens of ruminants worldwide, causing severe economic losses. Infection results in a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild respiratory disease to fetal death and mucosal disease. The virus particles are small and contain a singlestranded, positive-sense RNA molecule of approximately 12.3 kb with one large open reading frame flanked by two untranslated regions (5’UTR and 3’UTR). The polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved by viral and host proteases resulting in the formation of mature viral proteins. It is well established that BVDV strains show considerable genetic diversity. BVD viruses are classified as two species: BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. Quite recently, a new putative species, BVDV-3, was detected. The viruses exist as one of two biotypes: cytopathic or non- cytopathic, based on their activity in cell cultures. The phylogenetic analysis of the 5’UTR and N<jats:sup>pro</jats:sup> region has revealed at least 21 distinct subtypes of BVDV-1 and 4 subtypes of BVDV-2. Genetic diversity of BVD viruses has serious clinical implications such as immune evasion, increase of virulence, host range alteration and also affects the efficacy of vaccination programmes and diagnostic methods.</jats:p>

Sheeppox disease is associated with significant losses in sheep production world 
over. The sheep pox virus, the goatpox virus, and the lumpy skin disease virus 
cannot be distinguished by conventional serological tests. Identification of 
these pathogens needs molecular methods. In this study, seven genes viz. EEV 
maturation protein-F12L, Virion protein-D3R, RNA polymerase subunit-A5R, Virion 
core protein-A10L, EEV glycoprotein-A33R, VARV B22R homologue, and Kelch like 
protein-A55R that cover the start, middle, and end of the genome were selected. 
These genes were amplified from Roumanian-Fanar vaccine strain and Jaipur 
virulent strain, cloned, and sequenced. On analysis with the available database 
sequences, VARV B22R homologue was identified as a marker for phylogenetic 
reconstruction for classifying the sheeppox viruses of the ungulates. Further, 
divergence time dating with VARV B22R gene accurately predicted the sheeppox 
disease outbreak involving Jaipur virulent strain.

The wide spread prevalence of bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1) in 
cattle and recent identification of BVDV-2 in goats in India warranted 
pestivirus surveillance in sheep. Nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect BVDV-2 in one of 1561 blood samples 
collected randomly from 78 sheep flocks in 11 states of India. Antigenic 
characterization of the isolated pestivirus using polyclonal and monoclonal 
antibodies typed the isolate as BVDV-2. When analyzed at genetic level in N(pro) 
(N-terminal autoprotease) and entire gene region coding structural proteins, 
namely capsid (C) protein and envelope proteins E(rns) (ribonuclease secreted), 
E1 and E2 genomic organization was the same for all pestiviruses, the nucleic 
acid and amino acid sequences showed highest similarity with those of BVDV-2. 
When compared with BVDV-2 isolate 890, the sequence homology was 83.7% for C, 
84.6% for E(rns) and E1, and 81.5% for E2. The cleavage site C/E(rns) was found 
totally conserved while N(pro)/C was conserved only from C-terminus of N(pro), 
E(rns)/E1 site was conserved only from C-terminus of E(rns) and E1/E2 site was 
conserved only from C-terminus of E1. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide 
sequences in 5' untranslated regions (UTR), N(pro), E2, NS3 and NS5B regions 
placed the sheep isolate in a separate clade within BVDV-2 subtype b. This was 
supported by the presence of unique mutations in the structural protein coding 
regions beside NS3 and NS5B. To our knowledge this is the first report on the 
sequence analysis of the entire structural gene coding region of a BVDV-2b 
isolate. This is also the first occurrence of BVDV-2 subtype b in sheep, 
providing the evidence that this subtype can also occur in species other than 
cattle.

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most costly disease affecting the cattle 
industry. The pathogenesis of BRD is complex and includes contributions from 
microbial pathogens as well as host, environmental and animal management 
factors. In this study, we utilized viral metagenomic sequencing to explore the 
virome of nasal swab samples obtained from feedlot cattle with acute BRD and 
asymptomatic pen-mates at six and four feedlots in Mexico and the USA, 
respectively, in April-October 2015. Twenty-one viruses were detected, with 
bovine rhinitis A (52.7 %) and B (23.7 %) virus, and bovine coronavirus (24.7 %) 
being the most commonly identified. The emerging influenza D virus (IDV) tended 
to be significantly associated (P=0.134; odds ratio=2.94) with disease, whereas 
viruses commonly associated with BRD such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine 
herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza 3 
virus were detected less frequently. The detection of IDV was further confirmed 
using a real-time PCR assay. Nasal swabs from symptomatic animals had 
significantly more IDV RNA than those collected from healthy animals (P=0.04). 
In addition to known viruses, new genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus and 
enterovirus E were identified and a newly proposed species of bocaparvovirus, 
Ungulate bocaparvovirus 6, was characterized. Ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 was 
also detected for the first time in North America to our knowledge. These 
results illustrate the complexity of the virome associated with BRD and 
highlight the need for further research into the contribution of other viruses 
to BRD pathogenesis.

The present study was undertaken to characterize recent field isolates of 
infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) and partial sequencing of VP2 gene. The virus could be 
detected in 17 of 20 field samples from broiler chickens in Haryana state, India 
as well as in all the four vaccine strains. Nucleotide sequences of four field 
isolates and one vaccine strain were compared with 10 reported IBDV strains from 
different parts of the world. Nucleotide substitutions at 795G, 827T, 833C, 
857C, 897A, 905T, 908T, 1011A and 1094G specific for very virulent (vv) strains, 
were maintained in all the four field isolates. However, unique nucleotide 
substitutions at 806A-G, 851 C-T, 1010 T-C, 1019T-C and 1082T-C showed further 
divergence of these isolates from already reported vvIBDVs. Deduced amino acid 
substitutions at 222P-A, 256V-I, 279N-D, 294L-I and 299N-S specific for vvIBDV 
strains were also present in all the four isolates. The vaccine strain showed 
amino acid change 279D-N, a characteristic of attenuated vaccine strains. 
Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the field isolates in the present study 
were closely related to reported UK (UK661) and Japan (OKYM) field isolates. All 
the four field IBDV strains of the present study were closely related to each 
other but distinct from already reported vvIBDVs of India. On the basis of 
nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, it is very likely that IBD 
causing strains in this part of India are of very virulent character and are 
still undergoing changes at genetic level.

Kobuviruses are small non-enveloped RNA viruses that probably cause diarrhea in 
cattle and swine. Since its discovery in 2003, few studies have addressed bovine 
kobuvirus (BKoV; a species of Aichivirus B) infections. BKoV has been reported 
in Europe, Asia, and South America, suggesting a worldwide distribution. To 
investigate the presence of BKoV in Egypt, 36 fecal specimens from diarrheic 
calves in two different Egyptian provinces (Cairo and Sharkia) were screened by 
RT-PCR and 24 (66.7%) were found positive for BKoV. RNA from one of the positive 
samples (BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744) was subjected to next-generation sequencing to 
determine the complete BKoV genome sequence. When compared to the only recorded 
BKoV genome sequence (BKoV/U-1/AB084788), the studied strain showed 94 amino 
acid (aa) substitutions through its entire polyprotein (2463 aa), one nucleotide 
(nt) insertion and one nt deletion in the 2B gene and 4-nt deletions in the UTRs 
(2 each). Additionally, five VP1 and seven 3D sequences were obtained from other 
samples by using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. A discrepancy in the phylogenetic 
topography of VP1 and 3D was observed, where the Egyptian VP1 sequences were 
classified as a distinct cluster within the proposed lineage 1 (genotype A), 
which also contained strains from the UK, Brazil, and Japan. While, the 3D 
sequences from Cairo were related to those of Chinese strains unlike Sharkia 
ones that were more closer to Korean  strains. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first detection and genomic characterization of BKoV in Egypt or 
indeed Africa.

Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly devastating disease for the poultry industry 
as it causes high economic losses. In this present study, a DNA vaccine 
containing the F and HN surface antigens of a highly virulent Newcastle disease 
virus (NDV), NDV/1/Chicken/2005 (FJ939313), was successfully generated. Cell 
transfection test indicated that the vaccine expressed the F and HN genes in 
Hep-2 cells. The main objective of this study was to compare the extent of 
protection induced by DNA vaccination after homologous and heterologous 
NDV-challenge as determined by the amount of NDV shedding after challenge. 
NDV-antibody-negative chickens were vaccinated either once, twice or thrice 
intramuscularly at 7, 14 and 21 days old and were challenged 14 days post 
vaccination with either homologous virus (vaccine-matched velogenic 
viscerotropic Newcastle disease virus (vvNDV) strain, FJ939313), 
phylogenetically related to group VII, or a phylogenetically divergent 
heterologous virus (unmatched vvNDV strain, AY968809), which belongs to 
genogroup VI and shows 84.1% nucleotide similarity to the NDV-sequences of the 
DNA vaccine. Our data indicate that birds, which received a single dose of the 
DNA vaccine were poorly protected, and only 30-40% of these birds survived after 
challenge with high virus shedding titre. Multiple administration of the DNA 
vaccine induced high protection rates of 70-90% with reduced virus shedding 
compared to the non-vaccinated and challenged birds. Generally, homologous 
challenge led to reduced tracheal and cloacal shedding compared to the 
heterologous vvNDV strain. This study provides a promising approach for the 
control of ND in chickens using DNA vaccines, which are phylogenetically closely 
related to the circulating field strains.

The complete genome sequence of a virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) 
isolated from chickens in Egypt was determined and compared to the sequence of 
NDV strains isolated from different parts of the world. The genome is 15,186 
nucleotides (nt) long and consists of 6 genes in the order of 
3'-N-P-M-F-HN-L-5'. The genome contains a 55-nt leader region at the 3' end and 
a 114-nt trailer region at the 5' end. Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis 
showed that strain Egypt is closely related with the NDV strains isolated in 
China. In addition, the sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site of strain 
Egypt was identical to that of the NDV strain recently isolated in Mali. 
Determination of complete genome sequences of additional NDV strains from Africa 
is necessary to understand the epidemiology of currently circulating viruses in 
Africa.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), isolate 318 (EHDV-318), an untyped 
virus recovered from a sentinel calf herd at the Khartoum University farm in 
central Sudan, was characterized using molecular biological techniques. With dot 
blot hybridization technique, a cDNA probe derived from genome segment 6 of 
EHDV-2 (Alberta strain) hybridized with RNA from EHDV-318. Application of 
serogroup-specific EHDV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to EHDV-318 RNA resulted 
in specific amplification of a 387 bp PCR product. Amplification product was 
visualized on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Specificity of the PCR 
products was confirmed by chemiluminescent hybridization with a 
non-radiolabelled internal probe. No amplification product or hybridization 
signal was detected when the serotype-specific EHDV-1 or EHDV-2 PCR-based assays 
were applied to RNA from EHDV-318. The scientific data presented in this study 
indicated that cDNA probes and serogroup-specific PCR-based assay can be used to 
classify the virus as a member of EHDV serogroup, and as serotypically distinct 
from EHDV-1 and EHDV-2.

Genotype inclusive grouping of Indian type A isolates as observed in 1D region 
based phylogeny was distorted at complete L(pro) region, where the 
VP3(59)-deletion group lineages of genotype VII clustered away from both 
genotypes VII and VI, confirming its uniqueness and independent evolution of 
L(pro) and 1D region. Akin to the 1D region, this deletion group is gradually 
diverging genetically even at L region forming more number of lineages and 
inter-lineage distance at L region is considerably more than that for 1D region. 
The deletion group is restricted to India only as none of the exotic sequences 
clustered within this group. Notably, L protein exhibited variability comparable 
to external capsid proteins as evident from its high d(N)/d(S) ratio (0.105), 
number of variable amino acid positions (41%), low Ts/Tv ratio (3.47) and 
alignment revealed N-terminal region, beta2 sheet and C-terminal extension to be 
extremely variable. Basic residues at P1, P3 and only leucine at P2 were 
predicted to provide an optimum autocatalytic cleavage site at L/P1 junction. 
All of the eight sites identified to be under positive selection revealed aa 
substitutions of varied physicochemical properties and at two positions lineage 
specific signatures were observed, which supports the contention that lineages 
are evolving under differential selection pressure to adapt to the varied 
ecological environment.

Rotaviruses (RV) are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans and 
animals. Despite the seven groups/species of RV (A-G), recently it was proposed 
the creation of a new RV group/specie H (RVH) based on VP6 sequence analysis. In 
this study we determined the VP6, VP7, VP4, and NSP4 nucleotide and deduced 
amino acid sequences of 6 (BR59-BR64) RVH-positive stool specimens obtained from 
piglets with diarrhea in Mato Grosso do Sul, Central-West region of Brazil in 
2012, using RT-PCR assay. Based on the high sequence identities (>99%) of the 
VP6, VP4, VP7, and NSP4 genes among 5 of the studied fecal specimens 
(BR59-BR63), they are considered the same local rotavirus strain denominated 
RVH/BRA-1. In contrast, once that the fecal sample BR64 showed a relatively high 
difference (81.6% nt identity and 83.4% aa identity) in the VP7 sequence when 
compared to the other 5 specimens it was named RVH/BRA-2 strain. Comparative 
phylogenetic analysis showed that the 6 RVH strains do not cluster together with 
any available sequences of members of the established RV groups (RVA-RVG), 
however, seem to be related to RVB and RVG. These results confirm the presence 
of RVH in Brazil, demonstrate their genetic diversity, and provide new data that 
will assist in understanding the viral phylogeny and epidemiology, as well as 
the explanation of patterns of viral evolution and biological properties of RVH.

The Genome of the Chicken DT40 Bursal Lymphoma Cell Line,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>The chicken DT40 cell line is a widely used model system in the study of multiple cellular processes due to the efficiency of homologous gene targeting. The cell line was derived from a bursal lymphoma induced by avian leukosis virus infection. In this study we characterized the genome of the cell line using whole genome shotgun sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism array hybridization. The results indicate that wild-type DT40 has a relatively normal karyotype, except for whole chromosome copy number gains, and no karyotype variability within stocks. In a comparison to two domestic chicken genomes and the Gallus gallus reference genome, we found no unique mutational processes shaping the DT40 genome except for a mild increase in insertion and deletion events, particularly deletions at tandem repeats. We mapped coding sequence mutations that are unique to the DT40 genome; mutations inactivating the PIK3R1 and ATRX genes likely contributed to the oncogenic transformation. In addition to a known avian leukosis virus integration in the MYC gene, we detected further integration sites that are likely to de-regulate gene expression. The new findings support the hypothesis that DT40 is a typical transformed cell line with a relatively intact genome; therefore, it is well-suited to the role of a model system for DNA repair and related processes. The sequence data generated by this study, including a searchable de novo genome assembly and annotated lists of mutated genes, will support future research using this cell line.</jats:p>",0

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces six subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, each 
containing a 64 nucleotide (nt) leader sequence, derived from the 5' end of the 
genome by a discontinuous process. Several putative functional domains such as a 
papain-like proteinase (PL(pro)), main protease (M(pro)), RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase (RdRp), and RNA helicase encoded by the replicase gene are important 
for virus replication. We have sequenced four regions of the replicase genes 
corresponding to the 5'-terminal sequence, PL(pro), M(pro), and RdRp domains 
from 20 heterologous IBV strains, and compared them with previously published 
coronavirus sequences. All the coronavirus 5'-termini and PL(pro) domains were 
divergent, unlike the M(pro) and the RdRp domains that were highly conserved 
with 28% and 48% conserved residues, respectively. Among IBV strains, the 5' 
untranslated region including the leader sequence was highly conserved (>94% 
identical); whereas, the N-terminal coding region and the PL(pro) domains were 
highly variable ranging from 84.6% to 100%, and 77.6% to 100% identity, 
respectively. The IBV M(pro) and RdRp domains were highly conserved with 82.7% 
and 92.7% conserved residues, respectively. The BJ strain was the most different 
from other IBVs in all four regions of the replicase. Phylogeny-based clustering 
based on replicase genes was identical to the antigen-based classification of 
coronaviruses into three groups. However, the IBV strain classification based on 
replicase gene domains did not correlate with that of the type-specific 
antigenic groups. The replicase gene sequences of many IBVs recovered from 
infected chickens were identical to those of vaccine viruses irrespective of 
serotype, suggesting that either there has been an exchange of genetic material 
among vaccine and field isolates or that there is a convergent evolution to a 
specific replicase genotype. There was no correlation between the genotype of 
any region of the replicase gene and pathotype, suggesting that the replicase is 
not the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity.

A total of 232 stools collected from calves with rotavirus infection in herds 
located in northern Italy from 2003 to 2005 was investigated. Determination of 
the rotavirus G and P types was carried out using nested RT-PCR. G6 was the most 
prevalent genotype, accounting for 78.5% of samples, G10 accounted for 9.9% of 
samples and viruses of G8 type were found in 4.7% of samples. In 3% of samples, 
viruses were not classified due to concomitant infection with more G type 
strains, whereas viruses in 3.9% of samples could not be characterized with any 
of the G-specific primers used in this study. Most common P types were P[11] and 
P[5], accounting for 65.1% and 25%, respectively. In 2.6% of cases, samples 
reacted with multiple P-specific primers; no P[1] serotype was identified. The 
G6P[11] combination was predominant throughout the study period, i.e. 52.5% in 
2003, 50% in 2004 and 40% in 2005. The incidence of G6P[5] increased from 13.1% 
in 2003 to 27% in 2004 and 25.5% in 2005. The G10P[11] combination decreased 
markedly from 18% in 2003 to 2.6% in 2004, rising again to 7.3% in 2005. G8P[11] 
viruses were similarly present in 2003 (5%) and 2004 (4.3%), declining slightly 
in 2005 (1.8%).

Detection and genetic identification of pestiviruses in Brazilian lots of fetal bovine serum collected from 2006 to 2014,"<jats:p>ABSTRACT: The present study performed a genetic identification of pestiviruses contaminating batches of fetal bovine serum (FBS) produced in Brazil from 2006 to 2014. Seventy-three FBS lots were screened by a RT-PCR targeting the 5’untranslated region (UTR) of the pestivirus genome. Thirty-nine lots (53.4%) were positive for pestivirus RNA and one contained infectious virus. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 5’UTR revealed 34 lots (46.6%) containing RNA of bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1), being 23 BVDV-1a (5’ UTR identity 90.8-98.7%), eight BVDV-1b (93.9-96.7%) and three BVDV-1d (96.2- 97.6%). Six lots (8.2%) contained BVDV-2 (90.3-100% UTR identity) being two BVDV-2a; three BVDV-2b and one undetermined. Four FBS batches (5.5%) were found contaminated with HoBi-like virus (98.3 to 100%). Five batches (6.8%) contained more than one pestivirus. The high frequency of contamination of FBS with pestivirus RNA reinforce the need for systematic and updated guidelines for monitoring this product to reduce the risk of contamination of biologicals and introduction of contaminating agents into free areas.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a major cause of acute viral hepatitis in 
developing countries, has been classified into four main genotypes and a number 
of subtypes. New genotypes have been recently identified in various mammals, 
including HEV genotype 3, which has a worldwide distribution. It is widespread 
among pigs in developed countries.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the genetic diversity of HEV among humans 
and swine in Italy. The date of origin and the demographic history of the HEV 
were also estimated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 327 HEV sequences of swine and humans from 
Italy were downloaded from the national centre for biotechnology information. 
Three different data sets were constructed. The first and the second data set 
were used to confirm the genotype of the sequences analyzed. The third data set 
was used to estimate the mean evolutionary rate and to determine the time-scaled 
phylogeny and demographic history.
RESULTS: The Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree and the time of the most 
common recent ancestor estimates showed that the root of the tree dated back to 
the year 1907 (95% HPD: 1811 - 1975). Two main clades were found, divided into 
two subclades. Skyline plot analysis, performed separately for human and swine 
sequences, demonstrated the presence of a bottleneck only in the skyline plot 
from the swine sequences. Selective pressure analysis revealed only negatively 
selected sites.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides support for the hypothesis that humans are 
probably infected after contact with swine sources. The findings emphasize the 
importance of checking the country of origin of swine and of improving sanitary 
control measures from the veterinary standpoint to prevent the spread of HEV 
infection in Italy.

This review explores the recent advances that have been made in our 
understanding of host viral interactions in the intestine. Technical advances 
have allowed the initial definition of intestinal viromes in a number of species 
including humans. Important advances in our knowledge of the host response to 
viral infection have shown that interferon lambda has a role that is unique from 
type I interferons in the intestine. Lastly, our understanding of virally 
induced phenotypes has expanded through new studies that show bacteria can play 
an important role in the outcome of viral infection in the intestine.

Georgia, Athens 30602, USA.

The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) spike glycoprotein S1 subunit is required 
to initiate infection and contains virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific 
epitope(s). Reported are the S1 gene nucleotide and predicted amino acid 
sequences for the Florida 18288 strain and isolates GA-92, CV-56b, CV-9437, 
CV-1686, and 1013. These sequences were compared with previously published gene 
sequences of IBV strains, and phylogenetic relationships are reported. The S1 
amino acid sequence of Florida 18288 was 94.9% similar to the Connecticut 
strain, and GA-92 was 92.8% similar to the Arkansas 99 strain. S1 amino acid 
sequences of the California variants, CV-56b, CV-9437, and CV-1686, were 
97.6-99.3% similar to one another and only 76.6%-76.8% similar to the 
Arkansas-type strains. Isolate 1013, also from California, was 84.0% similar to 
Ark DPI and 77.9% similar to CV-56b. When comparing 19 viruses isolated from the 
United States, sequence variations were observed between amino acids 55-96, 
115-149, 255-309, and 378-395. Similar regions are reported to be involved in 
virus-neutralizing and/or serotype-specific epitopes. These data demonstrate 
that variant IBV strains continue to emerge, and unique variants may circulate 
among poultry in geographically isolated areas.

In the present study, the hemagglutinin genes from 12 influenza viruses of the 
H9N2 subtype were isolated from chicken flocks in different provinces of Iran 
from 2003 to 2005, amplified and sequenced. All of the 12 isolates showed 
similar sequences at the cleavage site, RSSF/GLF, bearing eight potential 
glycosylation sites and sharing the characteristic deduced amino acid residues 
alanine-190, glutamine-226, and glutamine-227 at the receptor-binding site. Ten 
out of these 12 isolates possessed leucine at position 226, which prevails in 
the sequences found in human H2 and H3 strains. Overall, the presence in these 
Iranian poultry H9N2 viruses of the sequence known to bind to human-type 
receptors and the presence of antibodies in the human population of Iran to H9N2 
showed that it is possible for circulating H9N2 avian influenza viruses in Iran 
to infect humans. Hence, extensive surveillance of H9N2 in this country is 
highly recommended.

Detection and molecular characterization of Porcine astrovirus strains associated with swine diarrhea,"<jats:p> Astrovirus has been reported to be associated with diarrhea in pigs. The current study was conducted for the detection and molecular characterization of astroviruses in diarrheic pigs submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, University of Minnesota. Intestinal contents from 269 pigs were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 62% were found positive for astroviruses. Of the positive samples, 20% were positive for astrovirus alone while astrovirus with rotavirus was detected in 58% of the samples. The remaining 22% revealed the presence of astrovirus along with Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, Transmissible gastroenteritis virus, or Porcine circovirus-2. Sequencing the capsid gene of 56 randomly selected samples confirmed them to be Porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV-4) with 58–100% nucleotide identity within these viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 2 possible subgroups. The results indicate that PAstV is present on swine farms in the United States and that it may be associated with diarrhea either alone or in combination with other enteric viruses. Further studies are needed to determine strain diversity among porcine astroviruses so that appropriate control strategies can be devised and implemented. </jats:p>",0

Seven strains of turkey arthritis reovirus (TARV) isolated from cases of turkey 
arthritis were characterized on the basis of their L class genome segment 
sequences, which were then compared with those of turkey enteric reovirus (TERV) 
and chicken reovirus (CRV). All three L class gene segments of TARVs and TERVs 
and their encoded proteins λA, λB, and λC were similar in size to those of CRV 
reference strain S1133. The conserved motifs such as C2H2 zinc-binding motif and 
conserved polymerase region were present in λA and λB, respectively. A conserved 
motif for ATP/GTP-binding site and an S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-binding 
pocket for methyltransferase were observed in λC protein of TARVs and TERVs with 
only one substitution as compared to that in CRV. We propose a new genotype 
classification system for avian reoviruses (ARVs) based on the nt identity 
cut-off value for each of the L class. Based on this new genotype 
classification, all ARVs were divided into six, seven and eight genotypes in L1, 
L2 and L3 genes, respectively. Interestingly TARVs and TERVs grouped with three 
CRVs (two arthritic strains from Taiwan and one enteritic strain from Japan) in 
genotype L1-I and formed a different genotypes (L2-I, L3-I) from CRVs in L2 and 
L3 genes. The maximum nucleotide divergence was observed in genotypes of L1 and 
L2 genes but less at amino acid level indicates mostly changes were synonymous 
type. Compared to L1 and L2 genes, the nonsynonymous changes were more in L3 
gene. Point mutations and possible reassortments among TARVs, TERVs and CRVs 
were also observed.

"Genomic evolution, recombination, and inter-strain diversity of chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 from Florida and Hawaii green sea turtles with fibropapillomatosis","<jats:p>Chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is a herpesvirus associated with fibropapillomatosis (FP) in sea turtles worldwide. Single-locus typing has previously shown differentiation between Atlantic and Pacific strains of this virus, with low variation within each geographic clade. However, a lack of multi-locus genomic sequence data hinders understanding of the rate and mechanisms of ChHV5 evolutionary divergence, as well as how these genomic changes may contribute to differences in disease manifestation. To assess genomic variation in ChHV5 among five Hawaii and three Florida green sea turtles, we used high-throughput short-read sequencing of long-range PCR products amplified from tumor tissue using primers designed from the single available ChHV5 reference genome from a Hawaii green sea turtle. This strategy recovered sequence data from both geographic regions for approximately 75% of the predicted ChHV5 coding sequences. The average nucleotide divergence between geographic populations was 1.5%; most of the substitutions were fixed differences between regions. Protein divergence was generally low (average 0.08%), and ranged between 0 and 5.3%. Several atypical genes originally identified and annotated in the reference genome were confirmed in ChHV5 genomes from both geographic locations. Unambiguous recombination events between geographic regions were identified, and clustering of private alleles suggests the prevalence of recombination in the evolutionary history of ChHV5. This study significantly increased the amount of sequence data available from ChHV5 strains, enabling informed selection of loci for future population genetic and natural history studies, and suggesting the (possibly latent) co-infection of individuals by well-differentiated geographic variants.</jats:p>",0

RNA2DMut: a web tool for the design and analysis of RNA structure mutations,"<jats:p>With the widespread application of high-throughput sequencing, novel RNA sequences are being discovered at an astonishing rate. The analysis of function, however, lags behind. In both the<jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>- and<jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>-regulatory functions of RNA, secondary structure (2D base-pairing) plays essential regulatory roles. In order to test RNA function, it is essential to be able to design and analyze mutations that can affect structure. This was the motivation for the creation of the RNA2DMut web tool. With RNA2DMut, users can enter in RNA sequences to analyze, constrain mutations to specific residues, or limit changes to purines/pyrimidines. The sequence is analyzed at each base to determine the effect of every possible point mutation on 2D structure. The metrics used in RNA2DMut rely on the calculation of the Boltzmann structure ensemble and do not require a robust 2D model of RNA structure for designing mutations. This tool can facilitate a wide array of uses involving RNA: for example, in designing and evaluating mutants for biological assays, interrogating RNA–protein interactions, identifying key regions to alter in SELEX experiments, and improving RNA folding and crystallization properties for structural biology. Additional tools are available to help users introduce other mutations (e.g., indels and substitutions) and evaluate their effects on RNA structure. Example calculations are shown for five RNAs that require 2D structure for their function: the MALAT1 mascRNA, an influenza virus splicing regulatory motif, the EBER2 viral noncoding RNA, the Xist lncRNA repA region, and human Y RNA 5.

We applied a high-throughput sequencing platform, Ion PGM, for viral detection 
in fecal samples from adult cows collected in Hokkaido, Japan. Random RT-PCR was 
performed to amplify RNA extracted from 0.25 ml of fecal specimens (N = 8), and 
more than 5 μg of cDNA was synthesized. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing 
using the 318 v2 semiconductor chip of these eight samples yielded 57-580 K 
(average: 270 K, after data analysis) reads in a single run. As a result, viral 
genome sequences were detected in each specimen. In addition to bacteriophage, 
mammal- and insect-derived viruses, partial genome sequences of plant, algal, 
and protozoal viruses were detected. Thus, this metagenomic analysis of fecal 
specimens could be useful to comprehensively understand viral populations of the 
intestine and food sources in animals.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes an emerging autochthonous disease in developed 
countries where links with a viral porcine reservoir have been evidenced. 
Moreover, chronic HEV infection and associated-cirrhosis have been described in 
severely immunocompromized patients. Nonetheless, only few studies have focused 
on pediatric HEV infections worldwide and only four autochthonous cases have 
been reported in children in developed countries. We describe here acute 
hepatitis E in three immunocompromized children. Case no. 1 was a 9-year-old 
liver transplant recipient girl in whom H1N1 2009 flu infection was diagnosed 
concurrently with hepatitis E. Case no. 2 was a 12-year-old boy presenting early 
medullar relapse of lymphoblastic leukemia of type B and in whom HEV RNA was 
detected over a 29-week period. Case no. 3 was a 9-year-old boy with a rare 
primary immunodeficiency due to XIAP deficiency. HEV infections were all 
autochthonously acquired and involved different viruses classified as subtype f, 
c, and e of genotype 3, which are those described in autochthonous cases in 
Europe. These three observations prompt to consider HEV as a causative agent of 
hepatitis in children in developed countries, and to perform particularly HEV 
testing in those severely immunocompromized who may develop chronic hepatitis E.

Population of wild boar is increasing in the whole Europe, the animals migrate 
close to human habitats which greatly increases the possibility of natural 
transmission between domestic animals or humans and wild boars. The aim of the 
study was to estimate in population of free-living wild boar in the Czech 
Republic the prevalence of enteric viral pathogens, namely rotavirus groups A 
and C (RVA and RVC), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 
(PRRSV), and members of family Coronaviridae (transmissible gastroenteritis 
virus - TGEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus - PEDV, porcine respiratory 
coronavirus - PRCV, and porcine hemagglutination encephalomyelitis virus - PHEV) 
and Picornaviridae,(teschovirus A - PTV, sapelovirus A - PSV, and enterovirus G 
- EV-G). In our study, stool samples from 203 wild boars culled during hunting 
season 2014-2015 (from October to January) were examined by RT-PCR. RVA was 
detected in 2.5% of tested samples. Nucleotide analysis of VP7, VP4, and VP6 
genes revealed that four RVA strains belong to G4P[25]I1, G4P[6]I5, G11P[13]I5, 
and G5P[13]I5 genotypes and phylogenetic analysis suggested close relation to 
porcine and human RVAs. The prevalence of RVC in wild boar population reached 
12.8%, PTV was detected in 20.2%, PSV in 8.9%, and EV-G in 2.5% of samples. 
During our study no PRRSV or coronaviruses were detected. Our study provides the 
first evidence of RVC prevalence in wild boars and indicates that wild boars 
might contribute to the genetic variability of RVA and also serve as an 
important reservoir of other enteric viruses.

DEAD-box helicases play essential roles in RNA metabolism across species, but 
emerging data suggest that they have additional functions in immunity. Through 
RNAi screening, we identify an evolutionarily conserved and 
interferon-independent role for the DEAD-box helicase DDX17 in restricting Rift 
Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-transmitted virus in the bunyavirus family 
that causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock. Loss of 
Drosophila DDX17 (Rm62) in cells and flies enhanced RVFV infection. Similarly, 
depletion of DDX17 but not the related helicase DDX5 increased RVFV replication 
in human cells. Using crosslinking immunoprecipitation high-throughput 
sequencing (CLIP-seq), we show that DDX17 binds the stem loops of host pri-miRNA 
to facilitate their processing and also an essential stem loop in bunyaviral RNA 
to restrict infection. Thus, DDX17 has dual roles in the recognition of stem 
loops: in the nucleus for endogenous microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and in the 
cytoplasm for surveillance against structured non-self-elements.

African swine fever virus (ASFV) outbreak has been considered as an emerging and 
re-emerging disease for almost a century. Diagnostically, simple polymerase 
chain reaction and sequencing-based molecular detection could be employed for 
both viral identification and genotyping. This study established a novel 
phylogenetic analysis and epidemiology comparison based on 205 bp of p72 gene 
sequences. Based on this partial p72 fragment, an updated list of 44 different 
genotypes from a total of 516 ASFV sequences compiled from GenBank was 
generated. Nucleotide diversity was 0.04325 ± 0.00231. The analysis of spatial 
genetic variation divided the ASFV populations of the African continent into 
four clades (clade A: central and upper eastern Africa; clade B: eastern Africa; 
clade C: eastern and southern Africa; and clade D: southern Africa). These 
results and the developed protocol could serve as useful molecular tools for 
ASFV diagnosis from degraded DNA or putrefied samples, and also provide the 
phylogeographic perspective to identify the origin of viral outbreaks, 
facilitating the decision planning to limit their spread.

‘Next‐Generation’ Surveillance: An Epidemiologists’ Perspective on the Use of Molecular Information in Food Safety and Animal Health Decision‐Making,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Advances in the availability and affordability of molecular and genomic data are transforming human health care. Surveillance aimed at supporting and improving food safety and animal health is likely to undergo a similar transformation. We propose a definition of ‘molecular surveillance’ in this context and argue that molecular data are an adjunct to rather than a substitute for sound epidemiological study and surveillance design. Specific considerations with regard to sample collection are raised, as is the importance of the relation between the molecular clock speed of genetic markers and the spatiotemporal scale of the surveillance activity, which can be control‐ or strategy‐focused. Development of standards for study design and assessment of molecular surveillance system attributes is needed, together with development of an interdisciplinary skills base covering both molecular and epidemiological principles.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

The National Livestock Epidemiology and Information Center (NALEIC) in Zambia 
reported over 132 cases of canine rabies diagnosed by the direct fluorescent 
antibody test (DFAT) from 2004 to 2009. In this study, the lineage of rabies 
virus (RABV) in Zambia was determined by phylogenetic analysis of the 
nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) gene sequences. Total RNA was extracted 
from 87-DFAT brain specimens out of which only 35 (40%) were positive on nested 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for each gene, and 26 
being positive for both genes. Positive specimens for the N (n=33) and G (n=35) 
genes were used for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the N gene 
showed two phylogenetic clusters in Zambia belonging to the Africa 1b lineage 
present in eastern and southern Africa. While one cluster exclusively comprised 
Zambian strains, the other was more heterogeneous regarding the RABV origins and 
included strains from Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia. Phylogenetic analysis of 
the G gene revealed similar RABV strains in different hosts and regions of 
Zambia. We designed primers for reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal 
amplification (RT-LAMP) assay from the consensus sequence of the N gene in an 
attempt to improve the molecular diagnosis of RABV in Zambia. The specificity 
and reproducibility of the RT-LAMP assay was confirmed with actual clinical 
specimens. Therefore, the RT-LAMP assay presented in this study may prove to be 
useful for routine diagnosis of rabies in Zambia.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes widespread disease in poultry and 
wild-birds throughout the world. cDNA microarray analysis was used to examine 
the effect of NDV infection on host cell transcription. The results show that 
NDV infection causes an apparent suppression of the interferon response genes 
during the early stages of infection. In addition, the results reveal 
transcriptional silencing of cytoskeletal proteins such as the alpha, beta, and 
gamma types of actin, and a downregulation of the thioredoxin gene, a likely 
mediator of apoptosis with possible implications in NDV pathogenesis. 
Comparative analyses show that a majority of genes that were transcriptionally 
regulated during infection with another common respiratory pathogen of poultry, 
the avian pneumovirus, remained unaltered during NDV infection, suggesting that 
even phylogenetically related viruses elicit unique or ""signature"" patterns of 
host transcriptional profiles during infection of host cells.

Two groups with three wild boars each were used: Group A (animals 1 to 3) served 
as the control, and Group B (animals 4 to 6) was postnatally persistently 
infected with the Cat01 strain of CSFV (primary virus). The animals, six weeks 
old and clinically healthy, were inoculated with the virulent strain Margarita 
(secondary virus). For exclusive detection of the Margarita strain, a specific 
qRT-PCR assay was designed, which proved not to have cross-reactivity with the 
Cat01 strain. The wild boars persistently infected with CSFV were protected from 
superinfection by the virulent CSFV Margarita strain, as evidenced by the 
absence of clinical signs and the absence of Margarita RNA detection in serum, 
swabs and tissue samples. Additionally, in PBMCs, a well-known target for CSFV 
viral replication, only the primary infecting virus RNA (Cat01 strain) could be 
detected, even after the isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue 
level in vivo. Furthermore, the data analysis of the Margarita qRT-PCR, by means 
of calculated ΔCt values, supported that PBMCs from persistently infected 
animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro 
inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, while this virus was able to infect 
naive PBMCs efficiently. In parallel, IFN-α values were undetectable in the sera 
from animals in Group B after inoculation with the CSFV Margarita strain. 
Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no 
E2-specific or neutralising antibodies) or cellular immune responses (in terms 
of IFN-γ-producing cells) after inoculation with the second virus. Finally, a 
sequence analysis could not detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the samples tested from 
Group B. Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon might be involved in the 
evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in CSFV control by vaccination. 
To the best of our knowledge, this study was one of the first showing efficient 
suppression of superinfection in animals, especially in the absence of IFN-α, 
which might be associated with the lack of innate immune mechanisms.

Molecular and biophysical characterization of TT virus: Evidence for a new virus family infecting humans,"<jats:p>The recent isolation of a novel DNA virus from the serum of a Japanese patient (T.T.) has provided the latest possible candidate virus associated with cryptogenic hepatitis. In the present study, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus (TTV) isolated from the serum of a West African. Based on PCR studies designed to amplify overlapping regions of the viral genome and sensitivity to digestion with mung bean nuclease, the viral genome is circular and negative stranded, and comprises 3,852 nt, which is 113 nt longer than the prototype isolate from Japan. Cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation demonstrated banding of the virus at 1.31–1.34 g/ml; filtration studies indicated that TTV had a particle size of 30–50 nm. These results suggest that the virus is similar to the Circoviridae, viruses known to infect plants and vertebrates (e.g., birds and swine); however, sequence similarity searches of available databases did not reveal identity between TTV and other viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of a 260-nt region from 151 globally distributed isolates demonstrated the existence of three major TTV genotypes. Several individuals at high risk for infection with parenterally transmitted viruses were infected with more than one genotype. There was no correlation between genotype and geographic origin. Finally, intravenous inoculation of TTV-positive human serum into chimpanzees demonstrated that TTV can be transmitted to primates; no biochemical or histological evidence for hepatitis was obtained. The distinct biophysical and molecular characteristics of TTV suggest that it is a member of a new family of viruses, which we have tentatively named the Circinoviridae.</jats:p>",0

The Azov and Black Sea basins are part of the transcontinental wild bird 
migration routes from Northern Asia and Europe to the Mediterranean, Africa, and 
Southwest Asia. These regions constitute an area of transit, stops during 
migration, and nesting for many different bird species. From September 2010 to 
September 2011, a wild bird surveillance study was conducted in these regions to 
identify avian influenza viruses. Biological samples consisting of cloacal and 
tracheal swabs and fecal samples were collected from wild birds of different 
ecological groups, including waterfowl and sea- and land-based birds, in places 
of mass bird accumulations in Sivash Bay and the Utlyuksky and Molochniy 
estuaries. The sampling covered the following wild bird biological cycles: 
autumn migration, wintering, spring migration, nesting, and postnesting seasons. 
A total of 3634 samples were collected from 66 different species of birds. 
During the autumn migration, 19 hemagglutinating viruses were isolated, 14 of 
which were identified as low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus subtypes 
H1N?, H3N8, H5N2, H7N?, H8N4, H10N7, and H11N8. From the wintering samples, 45 
hemagglutinating viruses were isolated, 36 of which were identified as LPAI 
virus subtypes H1N1, H1N? H1N2, H4N?, H6N1, H7N3, H7N6, H7N7, H8N2, H9N2, H10N7, 
H10N4, H11N2, H12N2, and H15N7. Only three viruses were isolated during the 
spring migration, nesting, and postnesting seasons (serotypes H6, H13, and H16). 
The HA and NA genes were sequenced from the isolated H5 and N1 viruses, and the 
phylogenetic analysis revealed possible ecological connections between the Azov 
and Black Sea regions and Europe. The LPAI viruses were isolated mostly from 
mallard ducks, but also from shellducks, shovelers, teals, and white-fronted 
geese. The rest of the 14 hemagglutinating viruses isolated were identified as 
different serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses (APMV-1, APMV-4, APMV-6, and 
APMV-7). This information furthers our understanding of the ecology of avian 
influenza viruses in wild bird species.

Infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV) is very common worldwide. HEV causes 
acute viral hepatitis with approximately 20 million cases per year. While HEV 
genotypes 1 and 2 cause large waterborne and foodborne outbreaks with a 
significant mortality in developing countries, genotypes 3 and 4 are more 
prevalent in developed countries with transmission being mostly zoonotic. In 
North America and Europe, HEV has been increasingly detected in swine, and 
exposure to pigs and pork products is considered to be the primary source of 
infection. Therefore we set out to investigate the prevalence of HEV in retail 
pork products available in Canada, by screening meal-size portions of pork 
pâtés, raw pork sausages, and raw pork livers. The presence of the HEV genomes 
was determined by RT-PCR and viral RNA was quantified by digital droplet PCR. 
Overall, HEV was detected in 47% of the sampled pork pâtés and 10.5% of the 
sampled raw pork livers, but not in the sampled pork sausages, and sequencing 
confirmed that all HEV strains belonged to genotype 3. Further phylogenetic 
analysis revealed that except for one isolate that clusters with subtype 3d, all 
isolates belong to subtype 3a. Amino acid variations between the isolates were 
also observed in the sequenced capsid region. In conclusion, the prevalence of 
HEV in pâtés and raw pork livers observed in this study is in agreement with the 
current HEV distribution in pork products reported in other developed countries.

Coronaviruses are of major importance for both animal and human health. With the 
emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the need for fast genome 
characterisation is ever so important. Further, in order to understand the 
influence of quasispecies of these viruses in relation to biology, techniques 
for deep-sequence and full-length viral genome analysis are needed. In the 
present study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches 
[sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and single primer 
isothermal amplification (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit)] coupled with 
high-throughput sequencing to generate the full-length genome of bovine 
coronavirus (BCoV) from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage 
(100% for SPIA and 99% for SISPA), however, there was a clear difference in the 
percentage of reads that mapped to BCoV. While approximately 45% of the Ovation 
reads mapped to BCoV (sequence depth of 169-284 944), only 0.07% of the SISPA 
reads (sequence depth of 0-249) mapped to the reference genome. Although BCoV 
was the focus of the study we also identified a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) 
in the data sets. The trend for this virus was similar to that observed for BCoV 
regarding Ovation vs. SISPA, but with fewer sequences mapping to BRBV due to a 
lower amount of this virus. In summary, the SPIA approach used in this study 
produced coverage of the entire BCoV (high copy number) and BRBV (low copy 
number) and a high sequence/genome depth compared to SISPA. Although this is a 
limited study, the results indicate that the Ovation method could be a preferred 
approach for full genome sequencing if a low copy number of viral RNA is 
expected and if high sequence depth is desired.

Phylogenetic analysis of the five different regions (5' non-coding region 
(5'NCR), N(pro), E2, NS3 and NS5B-3'NCR) of 48 Japanese and reported bovine 
viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) genomes was performed. Japanese BVDVs were 
segregated into BVDV1 subdivided into six subgroups and BVDV2. One isolate, So 
CP/75, isolated in 1975 and previously proposed as subgroup 1e according to its 
5'NCR sequence, was quite unique and formed an independent lineage in the tree 
of any region. Another isolate, 190CP, obtained from an experimental mucosal 
disease case was classified as subgroup 1e, defined by Becher et al. in the 
5'NCR, N(pro) and E2 regions, whereas it was classified as subgroup 1a in the 
NS5B-3'NCR region. The genomic sequences of the American isolates ILLC and ILLNC 
obtained from the GenBank database were assigned into subgroup 1b in the 5'NCR, 
N(pro), E2 and NS5B-3'NCR regions, whereas they were assigned into subgroup 1a 
in the NS3 region, suggesting that recombination between the virus strains 
classified into different subgroups had occurred in an animal. These findings 
suggest that phylogenetic analysis of several genetic regions is useful for the 
further characterization of field BVDV isolates.

Genomic properties of 62 field isolates of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) 
collected from 1974 to 1999 in Japan were investigated. The 5' untranslated 
region (UTR) was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) and the 244 to 247 base nucleotide sequences were determined. 
Serological properties were also characterized by the cross-neutralization test 
using antisera against the representative strain of the classified genotype. 
Using phylogenetic tree analysis, BVDV 1 was subdivided into two major clusters, 
BVDV-1a (29 isolates) and BVDV-1b (27 isolates). In group 1a, 3 differed from 
the other viruses, and were classified in a branch assigned as 1a'. However, 4 
isolates (So CP/75, 190 CP, 190 NCP and KS86-1-NCP) could not be assigned to 
group 1a or 1b. In comparison with the published sequence data, KS86-1-NCP, 190 
CP and 190 NCP were similar to the Southern Africa isolates that have recently 
been proposed as BVDV 1c. The 5' UTR sequence of So CP/75 was unique among those 
of BVDV 1, suggesting that the isolate should be classified into a new genotype. 
Only 2 out of 62 isolates collected in 1989 and 1990 were identified as BVDV 2. 
The results of the cross-neutralization test strongly supported these data, 
suggesting a close correlation between the 5' UTR sequence and the antigenicity 
of BVDV.

We identified novel viruses in feces from cattle with diarrhea collected in 2009 
in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, by using a metagenomics approach and determined 
the (near) complete sequences of the virus. Sequence analyses revealed that they 
had a standard picornavirus genome organization, i.e. 5' untranslated region 
(UTR) - L- P1 (VP4- VP3- VP2- VP1) - P2 (2A- 2B- 2C) - P3 (3A- 3B- 3C-3D) - 
3'UTR- poly(A). They are closely related to other unclassified Chinese 
picornaviruses; bat picornaviruses group 1-3, feline picornavirus, and canine 
picornavirus, sharing 45.4-51.4% (P1), 38.0-44.9% (P2), and 49.6-53.3% (P3) 
amino acid identities, respectively. The phylogenetic analyses and detailed 
genome characterization showed that they, together with the unclassified Chinese 
picornaviruses, grouped as a cluster for the P1, 2C, 3CD and VP1 coding regions. 
These viruses had conserved features (e.g. predicted protein cleavage sites, 
presence of a leader protein, 2A, 2C, 3C, and 3D functional domains), suggesting 
they have a common ancestor. Reverse-transcription-PCR assays, using specific 
primers designed from the 5'UTR sequence of these viruses, showed that 23.0% 
(20/87) of fecal samples from cattle with diarrhea were positive, indicating the 
prevalence of these picornavirus in the Japanese cattle population in Hokkaido 
Prefecture. However, further studies are needed to investigate the pathogenic 
potential and etiological role of these viruses in cattle.

A viral metagenomics approach was used to investigate fecal samples of Japanese 
calves with and without diarrhea. Of the different viral pathogens detected, 
read counts gave nearly complete astrovirus-related RNA sequences in 15 of the 
146 fecal samples collected in three distinct areas (Hokkaido, Ishikawa, and 
Kagoshima Prefectures) between 2009 and 2015. Due to the lack of genetic 
information about bovine astroviruses (BoAstVs) in Japan, these sequences were 
analyzed in this study. Nine of the 15 Japanese BoAstVs were closely related to 
Chinese BoAstVs and clustered into a lineage (tentatively named lineage 1) in 
all phylogenetic trees. Three of 15 strains were phylogenetically separate from 
lineage 1, showing low sequence identities, and clustered instead with an 
American strain isolated from cattle with respiratory disease (tentatively named 
lineage 2). Interestingly, two of 15 strains clustered with lineage 1 in the 
open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b regions, while they clustered with lineage 
2 in the ORF2 region. Remarkably, one of 15 strains exhibited low amino acid 
sequence similarity to other BoAstVs and was clustered separately with porcine 
astrovirus type 5 in all trees, and ovine astrovirus in the ORF2 region, 
suggesting past interspecies transmission.

GiRaF: robust, computational identification of influenza reassortments via graph 
mining.

Reassortments in the influenza virus--a process where strains exchange genetic 
segments--have been implicated in two out of three pandemics of the 20th century 
as well as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. While advances in sequencing have led to an 
explosion in the number of whole-genome sequences that are available, an 
understanding of the rate and distribution of reassortments and their role in 
viral evolution is still lacking. An important factor in this is the paucity of 
automated tools for confident identification of reassortments from sequence data 
due to the challenges of analyzing large, uncertain viral phylogenies. We 
describe here a novel computational method, called GiRaF 
(Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder), that robustly identifies 
reassortments in a fully automated fashion while accounting for uncertainties in 
the inferred phylogenies. The algorithms behind GiRaF search large collections 
of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-sampled trees for groups of incompatible 
splits using a fast biclique enumeration algorithm coupled with several 
statistical tests to identify sets of taxa with differential phylogenetic 
placement. GiRaF correctly finds known reassortments in human, avian, and swine 
influenza populations, including the evolutionary events that led to the recent 
'swine flu' outbreak. GiRaF also identifies several previously unreported 
reassortments via whole-genome studies to catalog events in H5N1 and swine 
influenza isolates.

The leader protease (L pro) and capsid-coding sequences (P1) constitute 
approximately 3 kb of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). We studied the 
phylogenetic relationship of 46 FMDV serotype A isolates of Indian origin 
collected during the period 1968-2005 and also eight vaccine strains using the 
neighbour-joining tree and Bayesian tree methods. The viruses were categorized 
under three major groups -Asian, Euro-South American and European. The Indian 
isolates formed a distinct genetic group among the Asian isolates. The Indian 
isolates were further classi?ed into different genetic subgroups (<5% 
divergence).Post-1995 isolates were divided into two subgroups while a few 
isolates which originated in the year 2005 from Andhra Pradesh formed a separate 
group. These isolates were closely related to the isolates of the 1970s. The 
FMDV isolates seem to undergo reverse mutation or convergent evolution wherein 
sequences identical to the ancestors are present in the isolates in circulation. 
The eight vaccine strains included in the study were not related to each other 
and belonged to different genetic groups. Recombination was detected in the L 
pro region in one isolate (A IND 20/82) and in the VP1 coding 1D region in 
another isolate (A RAJ 21/96). Positive selection was identi?ed at aa positions 
23 in the L pro (P < 0.05; 0.046*) and at aa 171 in the capsid protein VP1 (P < 
0.01; 0.003**).

Novel real-time PCR-based patho- and phylotyping of potentially zoonotic avian influenza A subtype H5 viruses at risk of incursion into Europe in 2017,"<jats:p>Since November 2016, Europe witnesses another wave of incursion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses of the Asian origin goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage. Infections with H5 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b affect wild bird and poultry populations. H5 viruses of clades 2.2, 2.3.1.2c and 2.3.4.4a were detected previously in Europe in 2006, 2010 and 2014. Clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1.c are endemic in Egypt and Western Africa, respectively and have caused human fatalities. Evidence exists of their co-circulation in the Middle East. Subtype H5 viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAI) are endemic in migratory wild bird populations. They potentially mutate into highly pathogenic phenotypes following transmission into poultry holdings. However, to date only the gs/GD H5 lineage had an impact on human health. Rapid and specific diagnosis marks the cornerstone for control and eradication of HPAI virus incursions. We present the development and validation of five real-time RT-PCR assays (RT-qPCR) that allow sequencing-independent pathotype and clade-specific distinction of major gs/GD HPAI H5 virus clades and of Eurasian LPAI viruses currently circulating. Together with an influenza A virus-generic RT-qPCR, the assays significantly speed up time-to-diagnosis and reduce reaction times in a OneHealth approach of curbing the spread of gs/GD HPAI viruses.</jats:p>",0

The nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequence of the fibre gene of the HNF-61 
strain of porcine adenovirus serotype 5 (PAdV-5) was determined and compared to 
that of the HNF-70 strain of the same serotype (Nagy et al., J Gen Virol 82, 
525-529, 2001) and also to adenovirus fibre genes from the genera Mastadenovirus 
and Atadenovirus. The putative HNF-61 and HNF-70 proteins were similar to each 
other, with 90% amino acid identity. Conserved amino acid sequences described 
for mastadenovirus fibre shafts were identified in the shaft regions of both 
PAdV-5 fibres, except for the so-called TLWT motif. The head regions of the 
PAdV-5 fibre did not resemble any of the known mastadenovirus fibre heads, but 
they showed characteristics of the fibre head protein sequences of viruses 
grouped in the proposed genus Atadenovirus (Benkö et al., Virus Taxonomy, 
Seventh Report of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, 
Academic Press, New York, San Diego, 2000, pp. 227-238). The findings suggested 
recombination between viruses of different adenovirus genera.

Dynamic Evolution of Endogenous Retrovirus-Derived Genes Expressed in Bovine Conceptuses during the Period of Placentation,"1. Genome Biol Evol. 2013;5(2):296-306. doi: 10.1093/gbe/evt007.

In evolution of mammals, some of essential genes for placental development are 
known to be of retroviral origin, as syncytin-1 derived from an envelope (env) 
gene of an endogenous retrovirus (ERV) aids in the cell fusion of placenta in 
humans. Although the placenta serves the same function in all placental mammals, 
env-derived genes responsible for trophoblast cell fusion and maternal immune 
tolerance differ among species and remain largely unidentified in the bovine 
species. To examine env-derived genes playing a role in the bovine placental 
development comprehensively, we determined the transcriptomic profiles of bovine 
conceptuses during three crucial windows of implantation periods using a 
high-throughput sequencer. The sequence reads were mapped into the bovine 
genome, in which ERV candidates were annotated using RetroTector(©) (7,624 and 
1,542 for ERV-derived and env-derived genes, respectively). The mapped reads 
showed that approximately 18% (284 genes) of env-derived genes in the genome 
were expressed during placenta formation, and approximately 4% (63 genes) were 
detected for all days examined. We verified three env-derived genes that are 
expressed in trophoblast cells by polymerase chain reaction. Out of these three, 
the sequence of env-derived gene with the longest open reading frame (named 
BERV-P env) was found to show high expression levels in trophoblast cell lines 
and to be similar to those of syncytin-Car1 genes found in dogs and cats, 
despite their disparate origins. These results suggest that placentation depends 
on various retrovirus-derived genes that could have replaced endogenous 
predecessors during evolution.

Nucleotide sequences of hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates infecting wild boars in 
Mie prefecture, which is located in the central region of Japan and is far from 
the most prevalent regions of HEV infection in Japan, were determined and 
characterised. Among 144 serum samples of wild boars captured in Mie prefecture, 
7 were positive for HEV-RNA. The nucleotide sequence of nearly the entire genome 
was determined for 4 of the 7 positive samples. Phylogenetic tree analyses 
indicated that 6 samples were subtype 3e and 1 was subtype 3a among the 7 
isolates. We identified the indigenization of subtype 3e isolates in Japanese 
wild boars. Furthermore, 5 subtype 3e isolates were closely related and were 
located in the peripheral branch of subtype 3e isolates from European countries 
in the phylogenetic tree. The structure indicated that the ancestor of the 5 
subtype 3e isolates originated in Europe. The phylogenetic structure and 
coalescent analyses suggested that the subtype 3e isolates entered Japan from 
Europe by importation of large-race pigs around 1966. The results also indicated 
that several lineages of subtype 3e expanded to a wide area of Japan around 1992 
and 1 of the lineages was indigenized in wild boars in Mie prefecture between 
1992 and 2009. The appearance of a wild boar cluster in the peripheral branch in 
the phylogenetic lineage may indicate the direction of gene flow of HEV subtype 
3e from swine to wild boars. Clarification of the transmission direction or 
route should be helpful to prevent a future endemic or epidemic of HEV 
infection.

Dysfunction of Bovine Endogenous Retrovirus K2 Envelope Glycoprotein Is Related to Unsuccessful Intracellular Trafficking,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are the remnants of retroviral infection of ancestral germ cells. Mutations introduced into ERVs halt the production of infectious agents, but their effects on the function of retroviral proteins are not fully understood. Retroviral envelope glycoproteins (Envs) are utilized in membrane fusion during viral entry, and we recently identified intact coding sequences for bovine endogenous retrovirus K1 (BERV-K1) and BERV-K2 Envs. Amino acid sequences of BERV-K1 Env (also called Fematrin-1) and BERV-K2 Env are similar, and both viruses are classified in the genus
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Betaretrovirus</jats:named-content>
            . While Fematrin-1 plays an important role in cell-to-cell fusion in bovine placenta, the BERV-K2 envelope gene is marginally expressed
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            , and its recombinant Env protein is defective in membrane fusion due to inefficient cleavage of surface (SU) and transmembrane subunits. Here, we conducted chimeric analyses of Fematrin-1 and BERV-K2 Envs and revealed that defective maturation of BERV-K2 Env contributed to failed intracellular trafficking. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis suggested that in contrast to Fematrin-1 Env, BERV-K2 Env could not be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the
            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>
            -Golgi network, where cellular proteases required for processing retroviral Envs are localized. We also identified that one of the responsive regions of this phenomenon resided within a 65-amino-acid region of BERV-K2 SU. This is the first report to identify that retroviral Env SU is involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, and it may help to elucidate the maturation process of Fematrin-1 and other related Envs.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Retroviruses utilize envelope glycoproteins (Envs) to enter host target cells. Mature retroviral Env is a heterodimer, which consists of surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) subunits that are generated by the cleavage of an Env precursor protein in the
            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>
            -Golgi network. SU and TM mediate the recognition of the entry receptor and virus-host membrane fusion, respectively. However, unexplained issues remain for the maturation process of retroviral Env. We previously reported that bovine endogenous retrovirus K2 (BERV-K2) Env lost fusogenicity due to a defect in the cleavage of SU and TM. In this study, we identified that mutations residing in BERV-K2 SU disturbed intracellular trafficking of BERV-K2 Env and resulted its inefficient cleavage. Because SU is not known to play an important role in this process, our study may provide novel insights into the maturation mechanism of retroviral Envs.

This project sought to investigate the domestic caprid rumen virome by 
developing a robust viral DNA isolation and enrichment protocol (utilizing 
membrane filtration, ultra-centrifugation, overnight PEG treatment and nuclease 
treatment) and using RSD-PCR and high throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques. 
3.53% of the reads obtained were analogous to those of viruses denoting 
Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, Podoviridae, Mimiviridae, Microviridae, Poxviridae, 
Tectiviridae and Marseillevirus. Most of the sequenced reads from the rumen were 
similar to those of phages, which are critical in maintaining the rumen 
microbial populations under its carrying capacity. Though identified in the 
rumen, most of these viruses have been reported in other environments as well. 
Improvements in the viral DNA enrichment and isolation protocol are required to 
obtain data that are more representative of the rumen virome. The 102,130 
unknown reads (92.31%) for the goat and 36,241 unknown reads (93.86%) for the 
sheep obtained may represent novel genomes that need further study.

Viral contamination along the production chain is a significant concern in both 
food safety and livestock health. Pigs have been reported to act as a reservoir 
for zoonotic viruses, sometimes emerging ones, and epidemiological studies have 
shown direct links between the consumption of uncooked pork offal and cases of 
hepatitis caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 in humans. The 
presence of HEV in swine herds has been reported, but its dissemination in pork 
production environments is still unknown. To investigate viral contamination 
sources in the swine industry, 452 environment and fecal samples, including 
samples from livestock transportation vehicles, were collected over a period of 
11 months from ten farms and one slaughterhouse that together represent a single 
production network. Hepatitis E virus RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR in 32 
samples from both inside and outside farm buildings, on trucks, and, mostly, 
from fomites collected in the slaughterhouse yard, such as on a utility vehicle. 
Phylogenetic analysis showed a wide diversity of HEV genotype 3 strains, similar 
to human and swine strains previously found. According to the results of this 
study, the movements of trucks and utility vehicles might play an important role 
in HEV dissemination on a slaughterhouse site and throughout an entire network.

Genetic Predisposition To Acquire a Polybasic Cleavage Site for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses with H5 and H7 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes evolve from low-pathogenic precursors through the acquisition of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been observed to occur naturally only in these HA subtypes, little is known about the genetic basis for the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site. Here we show that consecutive adenine residues and a stem-loop structure, which are frequently found in the viral RNA region encoding amino acids around the cleavage site of low-pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses isolated from waterfowl reservoirs, are important for nucleotide insertions into this RNA region. A reporter assay to detect nontemplated nucleotide insertions and deep-sequencing analysis of viral RNAs revealed that an increased number of adenine residues and enlarged stem-loop structure in the RNA region accelerated the multiple adenine and/or guanine insertions required to create codons for basic amino acids. Interestingly, nucleotide insertions associated with the HA cleavage site motif were not observed principally in the viral RNA of other subtypes tested (H1, H2, H3, and H4). Our findings suggest that the RNA editing-like activity is the key mechanism for nucleotide insertions, providing a clue as to why the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is restricted to the particular HA subtypes.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on the antigenicity of the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase. Of the 16 HA subtypes (H1 to -16) maintained in waterfowl reservoirs of influenza A viruses, H5 and H7 viruses often become highly pathogenic through the acquisition of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been known since the 1980s, the genetic basis for nucleotide insertions has remained unclear. This study shows the potential role of the viral RNA secondary structure for nucleotide insertions and demonstrates a key mechanism explaining why the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is restricted to particular HA subtypes in nature. Our findings will contribute to better understanding of the ecology of influenza A viruses and will also be useful for the development of genetically modified vaccines against H5 and H7 influenza A viruses with increased stability.

During an investigation of porcine fecal viruses using a metagenomics approach, 
a novel picornavirus was identified from the feces of a healthy two-month-old 
pig. This virus, named porcine picornavirus Japan (PPVJ), had a standard 
picornavirus genome organization, including the L protein region. The 5' 
untranslated region harbored a type II internal ribosomal entry site. This virus 
was most closely related to lesavirus 1 (amino acid sequence identity: 38.2 %) 
in P1, equine rhinitis A virus (25.8 %) in P2, and lesavirus 2 (40.9 %) in P3. 
According to the genus demarcations for the family Picornaviridae (less than 
40 %, 40 %, and 50 % amino acid sequence identity in P1, P2, and P3, 
respectively), PPVJ represents a new genus in the family Picornaviridae. PPVJ 
was detected in 23.3 % of the fecal samples (from 58.3 % of the farms across a 
wide area) from pigs less than four months old, by reverse transcription PCR, 
using specific primers designed from the 3D sequence, followed by sequencing. 
The host range and pathogenic potential of this virus in animals is yet to be 
determined.

Given that Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the major threats for the poultry 
industry, testing of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been carried out since 
2010 in cases of mortality in wild birds (passive surveillance) in Catalonia. 
The objective is to provide an early warning system to prevent the infection of 
poultry. Since 2010, 35 episodes of mortality in wild birds were attributed to 
NDV infection. Throughout this period there was a progressive expansion of NDV 
to new areas, with an increase in the episodes of mortality, although it is not 
clear whether they were the result of the spread of the virus, or of the 
improvement of the surveillance. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that two 
distinct sublineages of NDV, 4a and 4b, were circulating in Catalonia. Both 
sublineages seem to be endemic in the wild bird population, affecting mainly 
Eurasian-collared doves, with a clear pattern in relation to its spatial 
distribution (coincident with the distribution of this species), and its 
temporal distribution (with the majority of cases between September and 
February). So far, endemicity in wild birds has not resulted in ND outbreaks in 
poultry. However, there are still many uncertainties about, for example, whether 
NDV may expand to new areas of Catalonia (with higher poultry density), or about 
the threat that the apparently more novel sublineage 4a may represent. Hence, 
efforts should be made so that measures to prevent infection of poultry farms 
(particularly in high-risk areas and periods) are encouraged, and surveillance 
is maintained.

Surveillance of Rotavirus A (RVA) infections in North America swine populations 
are limited and not performed over a significant time period to properly assess 
the diversity of RVA strains in swine. The VP7 (G) and VP4 (P) genes of 32 
Canadian RVA strains, circulating between 2009 and 2015 were sequenced, 
identifying the G3P[13], G5P[7], G9P[7], G9[13], and G9[19] genotype 
combinations. The Canadian RVA strains were compared to the RVA strains present 
in the swine ProSystems RCE rotavirus vaccine. The comparison revealed multiple 
amino acid differences in the G and P antigenic epitopes, regardless of the G 
and P genotypes but specifically in the Canadian G3, P[13] and P[19] genotypes. 
Our study further contributes to the characterization of RVA's evolution and 
disease mitigation among swine, which may optimize target vaccine design, 
thereby minimizing RVA disease in this economically important animal population.

Long‐term evolution of viruses: A Janus‐faced balance,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>The popular textbook image of viruses as noxious and selfish genetic parasites greatly underestimates the beneficial contributions of viruses to the biosphere. Given the crucial dependency of viruses to reproduce in an intracellular environment, viruses that engage in excessive killing (lysis) can drive their cellular hosts to extinction and will not survive. The lytic mode of virus propagation must, therefore, be tempered and balanced by non‐lytic modes of virus latency and symbiosis. Here, we review recent bioinformatics and metagenomic studies to argue that viral endogenization and domestication may be more frequent mechanisms of virus persistence than lysis. We use a triangle diagram to explain the three major virus persistence strategies that explain the global scope of virus‐cell interactions including lysis, latency and virus‐cell symbiosis. This paradigm can help identify novel directions in virology research where scientists could artificially gain control over switching lytic and beneficial viral lifestyles.

In the present study, four chicken anaemia virus (CAV) isolates (CAV-A, -B, -E 
and -P) recovered from different geographical regions of India were 
characterized. CAV genome of 1,766 bp nucleotide region containing the complete 
coding region of VP2 and VP3 proteins, and partial coding region of VP1 protein 
were sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the Indian CAV 
isolates were aligned and compared with CAV isolates of European, Asian, 
American and Australian origin. Phylogenetic analysis of the Indian CAV isolates 
were also carried out based on the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. 
The results indicated that Indian isolates were genetically evolved from 
different parts of the world. Indian isolate, CAV-A was found closely related to 
European Cux-1 strain, CAV-B and -P were closely related to Bangladesh BD-3 
strain and CAV-E was closely related to Australian 704 strain. The pathogenicity 
of the four CAV isolates was studied in day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) 
chicks. Day-old SPF chicks (n=50) were divided into five groups comprised of 10 
chicks in each group. Group 1 was kept as control and groups 2-5 were infected 
with each CAV isolate separately. The chicks were infected at a dose rate of 1 
ml cell culture fluid (10(4.5)TCID(50)/0.1 ml) per bird intramuscularly. The 
clinical signs, mortality and packed cell volume (PCV) and body weight gain were 
recorded on 5, 10 and 15 days post-infection. At 15th day, all the birds were 
sacrificed and various organs, viz., thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver and 
bursa were examined for gross and microscopic changes. The pathogenicity study 
indicated that all the CAVs except CAV-B were able to produce clinical disease 
and immunosuppression in young chicks whereas the isolate CAV-B produced no 
clinical disease but only induced immunosuppression, which was revealed by 
microscopic examination of the lymphoid organs. The study showed valuable 
information on molecular epidemiological status of CAV isolates prevalent in 
India for the first time.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a collective term used to refer microparticles, 
exosomes, and apoptotic bodies produced by a variety of cells and released into 
interstitial spaces and bodily fluids. Serum exosomes can serve as invaluable 
biomarkers, containing m/miRNAs, lipids, and proteins, indicative of various 
conditions. There are currently limited studies on the characterization and 
mutual consensus of biomarker profiles of serum exosomes purified by different 
methods. Here we compared the advantages and disadvantages of two commonly used 
serum exosome purification procedures including ultracentrifugation (UC) and 
Total Exosome Isolation (TEI) reagent, by analyzing exosome size distribution, 
concentration, morphology and miRNA expression profiles. Serum was obtained from 
Marek's disease virus (MDV)-infected chickens that were either vaccinated 
against Marek's disease (MD), and thus protected, or unvaccinated and bearing 
MDV-induced tumors. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and Transmission 
Electron Microscopy (TEM) were performed to evaluate particle size, 
concentration, and morphological integrity, respectively. Our results indicate 
that the size distribution of particles purified by either procedure is 
consistent with that of exosomes (30-150 nm). TEI reagent generated higher 
yields and co-isolated additional EV populations that are slightly larger 
(∼180 nm). Based on the miRNA expression profiles from a previous high 
throughput sequencing experiment of exosome small RNAs, we selected six cellular 
and four MDV1 miRNAs, to validate their expression in UC- and TEI-purified 
exosomes. miRNA expression profiles displayed relative correlation between the 
two procedures, but distinctive differences were observed in abundance with 
TEI-purified exosomes showing higher miRNA expression consistent with higher 
yield than those purified by UC. TEI-purified exosomes from vaccinated chickens 
exhibited greater expression of tumor suppressor miRNA, gga-mir-146b and least 
expression of oncomiR, gga-mir-21 compared to those obtained from tumor-bearing 
chickens. We propose that gga-mir-146 and -21 can serve as serum exosome 
biomarkers for vaccine-induced protection and MD tumors respectively.

Improvements and widespread use of nucleic acid amplification and sequencing 
methods have led to the recognition of new virus diversity in various domestic 
animals, including pigs. In this study we utilized either virus species specific 
or broadly reactive PCR assays to describe the occurrence and genetic diversity 
of selected DNA viruses belonging to families Adenoviridae, Circoviridae, 
Anelloviridae and Parvoviridae in Cameroonian pigs. Fecal specimens were 
collected during spring of 2011. No adenoviruses, circoviruses and anelloviruses 
were detected, however, high prevalence and remarkable genetic diversity within 
the identified parvoviruses and, particularly, within bocaviruses was observed. 
PPV4 was the most prevalent virus (20%), followed by PBoV3 (18%), PBoV4 (18%), 
PBoV5 plus 6V/7V (16%), and PBoV1 plus PBoV2 (6%). The frequency of mixed 
infections with various combinations of these virus species reached 20%. Genetic 
analysis of the identified viruses showed that the capsid gene of PBoV1 and 
PBoV2 strains shared up to 91% and 94%nt sequence similarities to reference 
PBoV1 and PBoV2 strains, respectively. The identified PBoV3 and PBoV4 strains 
shared ≤ 95% and ≤ 98%nt identities with reference PBoV3 and PBoV4 strains, 
respectively, along the NS gene, whereas the PBoV5 strains shared 86%nt 
identities with Hungarian and 87%nt identities with Chinese PBoV5 strains along 
the capsid gene. In addition, a single PBoV5-like strain shared ≤ 71%nt sequence 
identity with other PBoV5 strains. This is the first study to report evidence of 
the circulation of bocaviruses in Africa and contributes to our understanding of 
the impact of globalization on the dispersal of new and emerging viruses.

          <jats:p>
            Avian leukosis virus (ALV) induces tumors by integrating its proviral DNA into the chicken genome and altering the expression of nearby genes via strong promoter and enhancer elements. Viral integration sites that contribute to oncogenesis are selected in tumor cells. Deep-sequencing analysis of B-cell lymphoma DNA confirmed that the telomerase reverse transcriptase (
            <jats:italic>TERT</jats:italic>
            ) gene promoter is a common ALV integration target. Twenty-six unique proviral integration sites were mapped between 46 and 3,552 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the
            <jats:italic>TERT</jats:italic>
            transcription start site, predominantly in the opposite transcriptional orientation to
            <jats:italic>TERT</jats:italic>
            . Transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of normal bursa revealed a transcribed region upstream of
            <jats:italic>TERT</jats:italic>
            in the opposite orientation, suggesting the
            <jats:italic>TERT</jats:italic>

            expression is upregulated in tumors with integrations in the
            <jats:italic>TERT</jats:italic>
            promoter region. We now report that the viral promoter drives the expression of a chimeric transcript containing viral sequences spliced to exons 4 through 7 of this antisense RNA. Clonal expansion of cells with ALV integrations driving overexpression of the
            <jats:italic>TERT</jats:italic>

Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) are arguably the most important viral 
pathogen of ruminants worldwide and can cause severe economic loss. Clinical 
symptoms of the disease caused by BVDV range from subclinical to severe acute 
hemorrhagic syndrome, with the severity of disease being strain dependent. These 
viruses are classified as members of the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae. 
BVDV are considered primarily a pathogen of cattle but can infect most ruminant 
species. The virus particle consists of a lipid bilayer membrane surrounding the 
encapsidated genomic RNA. Inserted in the outer membrane are two virus-encoded 
glycoproteins that contain the major antigenic determinants of the virus as well 
as receptor binding and cell fusion functions. A third glycoprotein is weakly 
associated with the virion, but also possesses unique features that play 
important roles in suppression of innate immunity. The viral proteins are 
encoded in a single, large open reading frame. The viral proteins are 
proteolytically cleaved from the polyprotein by different proteases. The 
structural proteins are processed by cellular signal peptidases while the 
processing of the nonstructural proteins is by the viral serine protease. The 
virus is assembled and matures in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi bodies of 
the cell. The virus is released via exocytosis, where viral proteins are not 
exposed on the surface of the cell.

Genetic relatedness of the caliciviruses: San Miguel sea lion and vesicular exanthema of swine viruses constitute a single genotype within the Caliciviridae,"<jats:p>The San Miguel sea lion viruses (SMSV) and vesicular exanthema of swine viruses (VESV) are related morphologically and antigenically, but little has been done to determine their genotypic relationship to each other and to other caliciviruses. To examine this relationship, reverse transcriptase PCRs were performed by using oligonucleotide primer sets designed to amplify portions of the 2C RNA helicase-like and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions with total cellular RNA purified from virus-infected cell cultures as a template. The 2C RNA helicase primers directed the amplification of this region from eight SMSV serotypes, five VESV serotypes, and four related viruses. The RNA polymerase primer sets amplified products from all these viruses except one. Phylogenetic comparison of the caliciviruses demonstrated that SMSV, VESV, and four related viruses are closely related while being distinct from feline calicivirus, the human caliciviruses (small, round-structured viruses), and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and that they should be classified as a single genotype within the Caliciviridae.</jats:p>",0
Donor‐derived infections and infectious risk in xenotransplantation and allotransplantation,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Post‐transplantation infections are common in allograft recipients and should be expected in all immunocompromised hosts. Based on the need for immunosuppression in xenotransplantation, procedures developed to enhance safety in allotransplantation can be applied in future xenotransplantation clinical trials. Standardized approaches can be developed to guide the evaluation of common infectious syndromes in xenograft recipients. The opportunity created by screening of swine intended as xenograft donors has equal applicability to allotransplantation—notably broader screening strategies for allograft donors such as use of advanced sequencing modalities including broad‐range molecular probes, microarrays, and high‐throughput pyrosequencing. Considerations in management of allotransplant‐ and xenotransplant‐associated infections are largely the same. Experience in xenotransplantation will continue to inform thinking regarding donor‐derived infections in allotransplantation. We expect that experience in managing complex allotransplant recipients will similarly inform clinical trials in xenotransplantation.</jats:p>",0

The pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), classical swine fever 
(CSFV) and border disease virus, are important livestock pathogens in many 
countries, but current vaccines do not completely prevent the spread of 
infection. Control of pestiviral diseases is especially difficult due to the 
constant viremia and viral shedding of persistently infected (PI) animals, which 
must be identified and eliminated to prevent disease transmission. Existing 
vaccines are limited by the delay between vaccination and the onset of 
protection, the difficulty of differentiating serologically between vaccinated 
and naturally infected animals and the need for broad vaccine cross-protection 
against diverse virus strains. Antiviral therapy could potentially supplement 
vaccination by providing immediate protection in the case of an outbreak. 
Numerous compounds with in vitro antiviral activity against BVDV have been 
identified through its role as a surrogate for hepatitis C virus. Fewer drugs 
active against CSFV have been identified, but many compounds that are effective 
against BVDV will likely inhibit CSFV, given their similar genomic sequences. 
While in vitro research has been promising, the paucity of efficacy studies in 
animals has hindered the commercial development of effective antiviral drugs 
against the pestiviruses. In this article, we summarize the clinical syndromes 
and routes of transmission of BVD, CSF and border disease, discuss currently 
approved vaccines, review efforts to develop antiviral therapies for use in 
outbreak control and suggest promising directions for future research.

The southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) is a threatened marine sentinel. 
During postmortem investigations of stranded sea otters from 2004 to 2013 in 
California, US, papillomas were detected in the oral cavity of at least seven 
otters via necropsy and histopathology. Next-generation sequencing of viral 
particles purified from a single papilloma revealed a novel papillomavirus, 
Enhydra lutris papillomavirus 1 (ElPV-1). The genome of ElPV-1 was obtained, 
representing the first fully sequenced viral genome from southern sea otters. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the entire L1 gene, as well as a concatenated protein 
identities plot of all papillomaviral genes revealed that ElPV-1 is a 
λ-papillomavirus, related to a raccoon papillomavirus (Procyon lotor 
papillomavirus type 1) and a canine oral papillomavirus. Immunohistochemical 
staining, using a cross-reactive bovine papillomavirus antibody, suggested that 
ElPV-1 is present in intranuclear inclusions and intracytoplasmic keratin 
granules. Virus-infected cells were scattered throughout the stratum granulosum 
and stratum spinosum of the gingival and buccal papillomas. Using 
ElPV-1-specific PCR, we confirmed viral DNA in oral papillomas from all seven 
stranded sea otters, with identical L1 sequences. This virus is associated with 
the development of oral papillomatosis in southern sea otters.

Metagenomic identification of a novel anellovirus in Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsii) lung samples and its detection in samples from multiple years,"<jats:p>To investigate viral pathogens potentially involved in a mortality event of 21 Pacific harbor seals (<jats:italic>Phoca vitulina richardsii</jats:italic>) in California in 2000, viral metagenomics was performed directly on lung samples from five individuals. Metagenomics revealed a novel seal anellovirus (SealAV), which clusters phylogenetically with anelloviruses from California sea lions and domestic cats. Using specific PCR, SealAV was identified in lung tissue from two of five animals involved in the 2000 mortality event, as well as one of 20 harbor seal samples examined post-mortem in 2008. The identification of SealAV in multiple years demonstrates that this virus is persistent in the harbor seal population. SealAV is the second anellovirus reported in the lungs of pinnipeds, suggesting that anellovirus infections may be common amongst marine mammals and that more research is needed to understand the roles of these viruses in marine mammal health and disease.</jats:p>",0
A Metagenomics and Case-Control Study To Identify Viruses Associated with Bovine Respiratory Disease,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a common health problem for both dairy and beef cattle, resulting in significant economic loses. In order to identify viruses associated with BRD, we used a metagenomics approach to enrich and sequence viral nucleic acids in the nasal swabs of 50 young dairy cattle with symptoms of BRD. Following deep sequencing,
            <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>
            assembly, and translated protein sequence similarity searches, numerous known and previously uncharacterized viruses were identified. Bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine influenza D virus, bovine parvovirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 6, bovine rhinitis A virus, and multiple genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus were identified. The genomes of a previously uncharacterized astrovirus and picobirnaviruses were also partially or fully sequenced. Using real-time PCR, the rates of detection of the eight viruses that generated the most reads were compared for the nasal secretions of 50 animals with BRD versus 50 location-matched healthy control animals. Viruses were detected in 68% of BRD-affected animals versus 16% of healthy control animals. Thirty-eight percent of sick animals versus 8% of controls were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. Significantly associated with BRD were bovine adenovirus 3 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.005), and the recently described bovine influenza D virus (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.006), which were detected either alone or in combination in 62% of animals with BRD. A metagenomics and real-time PCR detection approach in carefully matched cases and controls can provide a rapid means to identify viruses associated with a complex disease, paving the way for further confirmatory tests and ultimately to effective intervention strategies.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Bovine respiratory disease is the most economically important disease affecting the cattle industry, whose complex root causes include environmental, genetics, and infectious factors. Using an unbiased metagenomics approach, we characterized the viruses in respiratory secretions from BRD cases and identified known and previously uncharacterized viruses belonging to seven viral families. Using a case-control format with location-matched animals, we compared the rates of viral detection and identified 3 viruses associated with severe BRD signs. Combining a metagenomics and case-control format can provide candidate pathogens associated with complex infectious diseases and inform further studies aimed at reducing their impact.

Discovery of a Novel Single-Stranded DNA Virus from a Sea Turtle Fibropapilloma by Using Viral Metagenomics,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Viral metagenomics, consisting of viral particle purification and shotgun sequencing, is a powerful technique for discovering viruses associated with diseases with no definitive etiology, viruses that share limited homology with known viruses, or viruses that are not culturable. Here we used viral metagenomics to examine viruses associated with sea turtle fibropapillomatosis (FP), a debilitating neoplastic disease affecting sea turtles worldwide. By means of purifying and shotgun sequencing the viral community directly from the fibropapilloma of a Florida green sea turtle, a novel single-stranded DNA virus, sea turtle tornovirus 1 (STTV1), was discovered. The single-stranded, circular genome of STTV1 was approximately 1,800 nucleotides in length. STTV1 has only weak amino acid level identities (25%) to chicken anemia virus in short regions of its genome; hence, STTV1 may represent the first member of a novel virus family. A total of 35 healthy turtles and 27 turtles with FP were tested for STTV1 using PCR, and only 2 turtles severely afflicted with FP were positive. The affected turtles were systemically infected with STTV1, since STTV1 was found in blood and all major organs. STTV1 exists as a quasispecies, with several genome variants identified in the fibropapilloma of each positive turtle, suggesting rapid evolution of this virus. The STTV1 variants were identical over the majority of their genomes but contained a hypervariable region with extensive divergence. This study demonstrates the potential of viral metagenomics for discovering novel viruses directly from animal tissue, which can enhance our understanding of viral evolution and diversity.</jats:p>",0
Novel anellovirus discovered from a mortality event of captive California sea lions,"<jats:p>A viral metagenomic study was performed to investigate potential viral pathogens associated with a mortality event of three captive California sea lions (<jats:italic>Zalophus californianus</jats:italic>). This study identified a novel California sea lion anellovirus (ZcAV), with 35 % amino acid identity in the ORF1 region to feline anelloviruses. The double-stranded replicative form of ZcAV was detected in lung tissue, suggesting that ZcAV replicates in sea lion lungs. Specific PCR revealed the presence of ZcAV in the lung tissue of all three sea lions involved in the mortality event, but not in three other sea lions from the same zoo. In addition, ZcAV was detected at low frequency (11 %) in the lungs of wild sea lions. The higher prevalence of ZcAV and presence of the double-stranded replicative form in the lungs of sea lions from the mortality event suggest that ZcAV was associated with the death of these animals.</jats:p>",0

We report on the genetic analysis of 213 highly pathogenic avian influenza 
(HPAI) H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry in Vietnam between 2007 and 2010. 
Phylogenetic analyses of the viral genomes revealed 38 distinct viral genotypes, 
29 were novel and 9 were reported in Vietnam or neighboring countries in recent 
years. Viruses from only six genotypes persisted beyond one season or year. 
Thus, most reassortant viruses were transient, suggesting that such genotypes 
lacked significant fitness advantages. Viruses with clade 2.3.2.1 HA were 
re-introduced into Vietnam in 2009 and their prevalence rose steeply towards the 
end of 2010. Clade 2.3.4-like viruses (genotype V) were predominant in northern 
Vietnam and caused the majority of zoonotic infections, whereas clade 1.1 
(genotype Z) viruses were only detected in the Mekong delta region, in southern 
Vietnam. Antigenic analysis of representative viruses from the four clades 
indicated substantial drift.

BACKGROUND: Parvoviruses are classified into two subfamilies based on their host 
range: the Parvovirinae, which infect vertebrates, and the Densovirinae, which 
mainly infect insects and other arthropods. In recent years, a number of novel 
parvoviruses belonging to the subfamily Parvovirinae have been identified from 
various animal species and humans, including human parvovirus 4 (PARV4), porcine 
hokovirus, ovine partetravirus, porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), and porcine 
parvovirus 5 (PPV5).
METHODS: Using sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA), a novel 
parvovirus within the subfamily Parvovirinae that was distinct from any known 
parvoviruses was identified and five full-length genome sequences were 
determined and analyzed.
RESULTS: A novel porcine parvovirus, provisionally named PPV6, was initially 
identified from aborted pig fetuses in China. Retrospective studies revealed the 
prevalence of PPV6 in aborted pig fetuses and piglets(50% and 75%, respectively) 
was apparently higher than that in finishing pigs and sows (15.6% and 3.8% 
respectively). Furthermore, the prevalence of PPV6 in finishing pig was similar 
in affected and unaffected farms (i.e. 16.7% vs. 13.6%-21.7%). This finding 
indicates that animal age, perhaps due to increased innate immune resistance, 
strongly influences the level of PPV6 viremia. Complete genome sequencing and 
multiple alignments have shown that the nearly full-length genome sequences were 
approximately 6,100 nucleotides in length and shared 20.5%-42.6% DNA sequence 
identity with other members of the Parvovirinae subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis 
showed that PPV6 was significantly distinct from other known parvoviruses and 
was most closely related to PPV4.
CONCLUSION: Our findings and review of published parvovirus sequences suggested 
that a novel porcine parvovirus is currently circulating in China and might be 
classified into the novel genus Copiparvovirus within the subfamily 
Parvovirinae. However, the clinical manifestations of PPV6 are still unknown in 
that the prevalence of PPV6 was similar between healthy pigs and sick pigs in a 
retrospective epidemiological study. The identification of PPV6 within the 
subfamily Parvovirinae provides further insight into the viral and genetic 
diversity of parvoviruses.

Hepatitis E virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive‐stranded RNA virus with a 7.2 kb genome that is capped and polyadenylated. The virus is currently unclassified: the organisation of the genome resembles that of the <jats:italic>Caliciviridae</jats:italic> but sequence analyses suggest it is more closely related to the <jats:italic>Togaviridae</jats:italic>. Hepatitis E virus is an enterically transmitted virus that causes both epidemics and sporadic cases of acute hepatitis in many countries of Asia and Africa but only rarely causes disease in more industrialised countries. Initially the virus was believed to have a limited geographical distribution. However, serological studies suggest that HEV may be endemic also in the United States and Europe even though it infrequently causes overt disease in these countries. Many different animal species worldwide recently have been shown to have antibodies to HEV suggesting that hepatitis E may be zoonotic. Although two related strains have been experimentally transmitted between species, direct transmission from an animal to a human has not been documented. There are four currently recognised genotypes and two of the four contain viruses isolated from swine as well as from humans. Regardless of country of origin or genotype of the virus, most, if not all, strains belong to a single serotype. A promising recombinant vaccine candidate comprised of a truncated capsid protein is currently under evaluation in Nepal. Published in 2003 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",0

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has previously been reported in wild mongooses 
on Okinawa Island; to date however, only one HEV RNA sequence has been 
identified in a mongoose. Hence, this study was performed to detect HEV RNA in 
209 wild mongooses on Okinawa Island. Six (2.9%) samples tested positive for HEV 
RNA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 6 HEV RNAs belonged to genotype 3 and 
were classified into groups A and B. In group B, mongoose-derived HEV sequences 
were very similar to mongoose HEV previously detected on Okinawa Island, as well 
as to those of a pig. This investigation emphasized the possibility that the 
mongoose is a reservoir animal for HEV on Okinawa Island.

Since 2003, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses have caused outbreaks 
among poultry in Indonesia every year, producing the highest number of human 
victims worldwide. However, little is known about the H5N1 influenza viruses 
that have been circulating there in recent years. We therefore conducted 
surveillance studies and isolated eight H5N1 viruses from chickens. Phylogenic 
analysis of their hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes revealed that all eight 
viruses belonged to clade 2.1.3. However, on the basis of nucleotide 
differences, these viruses could be divided into two groups. Other viruses 
genetically closely related to these two groups of viruses were all Indonesian 
isolates, suggesting that these new isolates have been evolving within 
Indonesia. Among these viruses, two distinct viruses circulated in the 
Kalimantan islands during the same season in 2010. Our data reveal the continued 
evolution of H5N1 viruses in Indonesia.

Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) is an enterovirus that is both genetically 
and antigenically closely related to human coxsackievirus B5 within the 
Picornaviridae family. SVDV is the causative agent of a highly contagious 
(though rarely fatal) vesicular disease in pigs. We report a rapid method that 
is suitable for sequencing the complete protein-encoding sequences of SVDV 
isolates in which the RNA is relatively intact. The approach couples a single 
PCR amplification reaction, using only a single PCR primer set to amplify the 
near-complete SVDV genome, with deep-sequencing using a small fraction of the 
capacity of a Roche GS FLX sequencing platform. Sequences were initially 
verified through one of two criteria; either a match between a de novo assembly 
and a reference mapping, or a match between all of five different reference 
mappings performed against a fixed set of starting reference genomes with 
significant genetic distances within the same species of viruses. All reference 
mappings used an iterative method to avoid bias. Further verification was 
achieved through phylogenetic analysis against published SVDV genomes and 
additional Enterovirus B sequences. This approach allows high confidence in the 
obtained consensus sequences, as well as provides sufficiently high and evenly 
dispersed sequence coverage to allow future studies of intra-host variation.

Different RNA splicing mechanisms contribute to diverse infective outcome of classical swine fever viruses of differing virulence: insights from the deep sequencing data in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells,"<jats:p>Molecular mechanisms underlying RNA splicing regulation in response to viral infection are poorly understood. Classical swine fever (CSF), one of the most economically important and highly contagious swine diseases worldwide, is caused by classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain the digital gene expression (DGE) profile in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells (SUVEC) to identify different response genes for CSFV by using both Shimen and C strains. The numbers of clean tags obtained from the libraries of the control and both CSFV-infected libraries were 3,473,370, 3,498,355, and 3,327,493 respectively. In the comparison among the control, CSFV-C, and CSFV-Shimen groups, 644, 158, and 677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were confirmed in the three groups. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that many of these DEGs were enriched in spliceosome, ribosome, proteasome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, cell cycle, focal adhesion, Wnt signalling pathway, etc., where the processes differ between CSFV strains of differing virulence. To further elucidate important mechanisms related to the differential infection by the CSFV Shimen and C strains, we identified four possible profiles to assess the significantly expressed genes only by CSFV Shimen or CSFV C strain. GO analysis showed that infection with CSFV Shimen and C strains disturbed ‘RNA splicing’ of SUVEC, resulting in differential ‘gene expression’ in SUVEC. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identified as a significant response regulator contributed to impact on SUVEC function for CSFV Shimen. This computational study suggests that CSFV of differing virulence could induce alterations in RNA splicing regulation in the host cell to change cell metabolism, resulting in acute haemorrhage and pathological damage or infectious tolerance.</jats:p>",0

Avian pneumovirus (APV, Turkey rhinotracheitis virus) and Human metapneumovirus 
(hMPV) are pathogens of birds and humans, respectively, that are associated with 
upper respiratory tract infections. Based on their different genomic 
organization and low level of nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identity with 
paramyxoviruses in the genus Pneumovirus, APV and hMPV have been classified into 
a new genus referred to as Metapneumovirus. First isolated in 1970s, APV strains 
have since been isolated in Europe, Africa, middle east, and United States (US) 
and classified in four subgroups, APV/A, APV/B, APV/C, and APV/D based on nt and 
predicted aa sequence identity. Although it was first isolated in 2001, 
serological evidence indicates that hMPV may have been present in human 
population from as early as the 1950s. There is only one subgroup of hMPV so 
far, whose nt and aa sequence identity indicates that it is more closely related 
to APV/C than to APV/A, APV/B, or APV/D.

BACKGROUND: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) types 1 and 2 are members of the 
Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. This genus also includes the 
HoBi-like virus, tentatively classified as BVDV type 3. BVDV-1 is widely 
distributed in Italy despite the extensive use of BVDV-1-based vaccines, while 
BVDV-2 and HoBi-like Pestivirus have been detected occasionally. Monitoring the 
occurrence of sporadic or atypical pestiviruses is a useful approach to evaluate 
the need for additional vaccine strains that can be used in BVDV control 
programs.
RESULTS: In this study we developed a multiwell antibody ELISA based on the 
recombinant E2 protein of the three bovine pestiviruses. We evaluated the 
assay's applicability for surveillance purposes using pooled milk samples, each 
prepared from a maximum of 35 lactating cows and collected from 176 dairy herds. 
As expected, the majority of the pooled samples reacted to a greater extent 
against the BVDV-1 E2 antigen. All three milk pools from a single farm reacted 
to the BVDV-2 antigen, however. Further analysis using spot tests, antigen 
detection, and sequence analysis of the 5'-UTR region confirmed the presence of 
five persistently infected calves carrying a BVDV-2a strain.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights for the first time that sporadic circulation 
of BVDV-2 can be predicted by immunoenzymatic methods in the absence of specific 
vaccination.

Severe outbreaks of diarrhoeic syndrome occurred in young foals at the same stud 
farm during two consecutive breeding periods namely spring 2006 and 2007. 
Rotavirus-like particles were detected by electron microscopy in the faeces of 
the affected foals and group A rotavirus infection was confirmed by 
Reverse-Transcription (RT)-PCR with selected sets of rotavirus-specific primers. 
Sequence analysis of the genes encoding the outer capsid rotavirus proteins VP7 
and VP4 enabled classification of the viruses as G3AP[12] and revealed that the 
viruses were highly similar to recently reported equine rotavirus strains 
circulating in Europe. All Greek equine rotavirus isolates were genetically 
identical, suggesting persistence of the same viral strain in the stud farm, 
over the two consecutive foaling periods.

BACKGROUND: African swine fever (ASF) is a re-expanding devastating viral 
disease currently threatening the pig industry worldwide. MicroRNAs are a class 
of 17-25 nucleotide non- coding RNAs that have been shown to have critical 
functions in a wide variety of biological processes, such as cell 
differentiation, cell cycle regulation, carcinogenesis, apoptosis, regulation of 
immunity as well as in viral infections by cleavage or translational repression 
of mRNAs. Nevertheless, there is no information about miRNA expression in an 
ASFV infection.
METHODS: In this proof-of-concept study, we have analyzed miRNAs expressed in 
spleen and submandibular lymph node of experimentally infected pigs with a 
virulent (E75) or its derived attenuated (E75CV1) ASFV strain, as well as, at 
different times post-infection with the virulent strain, by high throughput 
sequencing of small RNA libraries.
RESULTS: Spleen presented a more differential expression pattern than lymph 
nodes in an ASFV infection. Of the most abundant miRNAs, 12 were differentially 
expressed in both tissues at two different times in infected animals with the 
virulent strain. Of these, miR-451, miR-145-5p, miR-181a and miR-122 presented 
up-regulation at late times post-infection while miR-92a, miR-23a, miR-92b-3p, 
miR-126-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-30d, miR-23b and miR-92c showed down-regulation. Of 
the 8 differentially expressed miRNAs identified at the same time post-infection 
in infected animals with the virulent strain compared with animals infected with 
its attenuated strain, miR-126-5p, miR-92c, miR-92a, miR-30e-5p and miR-500a-5p 
presented up-regulation whereas miR-125b, miR-451 and miR-125a were 
down-regulated. All these miRNAs have been shown to be associated with cellular 
genes involved in pathways related to the immune response, virus-host 
interactions as well as with several viral genes.
CONCLUSION: The study of miRNA expression will contribute to a better 
understanding of African swine fever virus pathogenesis, essential in the 
development of any disease control strategy.

Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the essential etiological infectious agent 
of PCV2-systemic disease and has been associated with other swine diseases, all 
of them collectively known as porcine circovirus diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 
are a new class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression 
post-transcriptionally. miRNAs play an increasing role in many biological 
processes. The study of miRNA-mediated host-pathogen interactions has emerged in 
the last decade due to the important role that miRNAs play in antiviral defense. 
The objective of this study was to identify the miRNA expression pattern in PCV2 
subclinically infected and non-infected pigs. For this purpose an experimental 
PCV2 infection was carried out and small-RNA libraries were constructed from 
tonsil and mediastinal lymph node (MLN) of infected and non-infected pigs. High 
throughput sequencing determined differences in miRNA expression in MLN between 
infected and non-infected while, in tonsil, a very conserved pattern was 
observed. In MLN, miRNA 126-3p, miRNA 126-5p, let-7d-3p, mir-129a and 
mir-let-7b-3p were up-regulated whereas mir-193a-5p, mir-574-5p and mir-34a 
down-regulated. Prediction of functional analysis showed that these miRNAs can 
be involved in pathways related to immune system and in processes related to the 
pathogenesis of PCV2, although functional assays are needed to support these 
predictions. This is the first study on miRNA gene expression in pigs infected 
with PCV2 using a high throughput sequencing approach in which several host 
miRNAs were differentially expressed in response to PCV2 infection.

BACKGROUND: African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the etiological agent of African 
swine fever (ASF), a re-expanding devastating and highly lethal hemorrhagic 
viral disease. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small non-coding RNAs that 
regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. The discovery of virus specific 
miRNAs has increased both in number and importance in the past few years. We 
have recently described the differential expression of several porcine miRNAs 
during in vivo infection with attenuated and virulent ASFV strains. Here, we 
have extended these studies trying to identify the presence of viral miRNAs 
encoded by ASFV in an in vivo infection in pigs.
RESULTS: Sixteen small RNA libraries were analyzed from spleen and submandibular 
lymph nodes obtained from eight pigs, seven infected with either the virulent 
E75 ASFV strain or its attenuated counterpart E75CV1, or from pigs surviving 
E75CV1-infection and challenged with BA71 (heterologous challenge) and one non 
infected as negative control. Samples were recovered at different times 
post-infection. Libraries were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Some 
viral miRNA candidates were initially identified, which did not correspond to 
porcine miRNAs. Further structural analyses were carried out in order to confirm 
if they met the conformational requirements to be considered a viral miRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of sixteen small RNA libraries prepared from two 
different tissues obtained from pigs experimentally infected with E75, E75CV1 or 
with E75CV1 plus BA71, revealed the presence of six potential miRNA sequences 
but none of them met the requirements to be considered as viral miRNAs. Thus, we 
can conclude that ASFV does not express miRNAs in vivo, at least under the 
experimental conditions described here.

Porcine Teschoviruses (PTVs) are associated with polioencephalomyelitis and 
various diseases, including reproductive and gastrointestinal disorders, of pigs 
and wild boars, and are also detected in the feces of healthy pigs. The genus 
Teschovirus contains a single species Teschovirus A that currently includes 13 
serotypes. In the present study, we identified novel PTVs that are distantly 
related to Teschovirus A and were found in fecal samples of pigs with or without 
diarrhea in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid (aa) sequences of the 
complete coding region revealed that these newly identified viruses did not 
cluster with any strains of PTVs or other strains within the picornavirus 
supergroup 1, suggesting that the viruses may not belong to Teschovirus A or any 
genus of the family Picornaviridae. These novel PTVs share a type IV internal 
ribosomal entry site and conserved characteristic motifs in the coding region, 
yet exhibit 62.2-79.0%, 86.6-92.8%, 77.1-81.0%, and 84.3-86.7% aa identities to 
PTV strains in P1, 2C, 3C, and 3D regions, respectively. In contrast, PTV 1-13 
strains of the Teschovirus A share 76.5-92.1%, 88.1-99.7%, 93.2-100%, and 
95.8-100% aa identities in the P1, 2C, 3C, and 3D, respectively, within the 
species. These data imply that the newly identified viruses belong to 
teschoviruses, and may represent a novel species in the genus Teschovirus.

Following mass deaths of Laughing Doves (Streptopelia senegalensis) in different 
localities throughout Kenya, internal organs obtained during necropsy of two 
moribund birds were sampled and analyzed by next generation sequencing. We 
isolated the virulent strain of pigeon paramyxovirus type-1 (PPMV-1), 
PPMV1/Laughing Dove/Kenya/Isiolo/B2/2012, which had a characteristic fusion gene 
motif (110)GGRRQKRF(117). We obtained a partial full genome of 15,114 
nucleotides. The phylogenetic relationship based on the fusion gene and genomic 
sequence grouped our isolate as class II genotype VI, a group of viruses 
commonly isolated from wild birds but potentially lethal to Chickens ( Gallus 
gallus domesticus ). The fusion gene isolate clustered with PPMV-I strains from 
pigeons (Columbidae) in Nigeria. The complete genome showed a basal and highly 
divergent lineage to American, European, and Asian strains, indicating a 
divergent evolutionary pathway. The isolated strain is highly virulent and 
apparently species-specific to Laughing Doves in Kenya. Risk of transmission of 
such a strain to poultry is potentially high whereas the cyclic epizootic in 
doves is a threat to conservation of wild Columbidae in Kenya.

Molecular Evolution of the Human Enteroviruses: Correlation of Serotype with VP1 Sequence and Application to Picornavirus Classification,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Sixty-six human enterovirus serotypes have been identified by serum neutralization, but the molecular determinants of the serotypes are unknown. Since the picornavirus VP1 protein contains a number of neutralization domains, we hypothesized that the VP1 sequence should correspond with neutralization (serotype) and, hence, with phylogenetic lineage. To test this hypothesis and to analyze the phylogenetic relationships among the human enteroviruses, we determined the complete VP1 sequences of the prototype strains of 47 human enterovirus serotypes and 10 antigenic variants. Our sequences, together with those available from GenBank, comprise a database of complete VP1 sequences for all 66 human enterovirus serotypes plus additional strains of seven serotypes. Phylogenetic trees constructed from complete VP1 sequences produced the same four major clusters as published trees based on partial VP2 sequences; in contrast to the VP2 trees, however, in the VP1 trees strains of the same serotype were always monophyletic. In pairwise comparisons of complete VP1 sequences, enteroviruses of the same serotype were clearly distinguished from those of heterologous serotypes, and the limits of intraserotypic divergence appeared to be about 25% nucleotide sequence difference or 12% amino acid sequence difference. Pairwise comparisons suggested that coxsackie A11 and A15 viruses should be classified as strains of the same serotype, as should coxsackie A13 and A18 viruses. Pairwise identity scores also distinguished between enteroviruses of different clusters and enteroviruses from picornaviruses of different genera. The data suggest that VP1 sequence comparisons may be valuable in enterovirus typing and in picornavirus taxonomy by assisting in the genus assignment of unclassified picornaviruses.</jats:p>",0

Analysis of the VP1 capsid protein coding region of simian virus (SV) 2, SV16, 
SV18, SV42, SV44, SV45, and SV49 demonstrates that they are clearly distinct 
from members of the Enterovirus genus and from members of other existing 
picornavirus genera. To further characterize this group of viruses and to 
clarify their classification within the Picornaviridae, we have determined the 
complete genomic sequence of SV2 (8126 nucleotides). The genome was typical of 
members of Picornaviridae, encoding a single open reading frame. The putative 
polyprotein contained typical picornavirus protease cleavage sites, yielding 
mature proteins homologous to each of the known picornavirus proteins. SV2 
contained an amino-terminal extension of the reading frame, which was analogous 
to the leader protein of members of the Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, Erbovirus, 
Kobuvirus, and Teschovirus genera, but there was no significant amino acid 
homology with any of these known leader proteins. The 2A protein also aligned 
poorly with the 2A proteins of other picornaviruses. The deduced amino acid 
sequences of the SV2 structural and nonstructural proteins were related to but 
phylogenetically distinct from those of enteroviruses and human rhinoviruses. 
The major distinguishing features of SV2 were the presence of a type 2 internal 
ribosome entry site in the 5'-NTR, a putative leader protein encoded upstream of 
the structural proteins, and an unusually large 2A protein. On the basis of the 
molecular analysis, we propose that SV2, SV16, SV18, SV42, SV44, SV45, SV49, and 
porcine enterovirus 8 be classified as members of a new genus in Picornaviridae 
and that SV2 (strain 2383) be designated as the type strain.

The aim was to carry out a phylogenetic study of bovine viral diarrhoea viruses 
(BVDV) circulating in Irish cattle herds from 2011 to 2014. Three hundred and 
twenty five viruses from 267 herds were subtyped by nucleotide sequence analysis 
of the 5'UTR and/or the Npro regions. All viruses investigated in this study 
belonged to species BVDV-1 with BVDV-1a as the prominent subtype (97%). Subtypes 
BVDV-1b, BVDV-1d and BVDV-1e were also identified for the first time in Ireland. 
Pairwise alignments of 225 viruses with complete sequences for the 5'UTR and the 
Npro regions were performed to determine a low conflict threshold for virus 
strain demarcation. One hundred and seventy seven unique virus strains were 
identified. The study revealed significant levels of herd specific clustering of 
strains but no geographical or temporal clustering. Similar virus strains were 
identified in different counties, provinces and years indicating the potential 
to investigate the epidemiology of the disease by combining sequence analysis 
with animal movement data.

Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified into two species, namely, 
Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and Bovine viral diarrhea virus 2, and affects 
cattle worldwide, resulting in significant economic loss. The prevalence of 
BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 infections and its genotypes in Mongolian animals has not been 
studied. In this study, we surveyed BVDV infection in dairy cattle and yaks from 
Bornuur and Bulgan counties by RT-PCR, and the average infection rate in the 
sampling sites was 15.8 % and 20.0 %, respectively. In addition, molecular 
features of the 5'-UTR region of the BVDV genome in Mongolian cattle and yaks 
were identified as belonging to the subtypes BVDV-1a and BVDV-2a, respectively. 
Determining the prevalence, geographical distribution, and molecular diversity 
of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 in various host species in Mongolia is important for

The objective of the present work is the description outbreaks caused by bovine 
viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in commercial beef cattle ranches in Argentina. 
Genetic affiliation and their association with the clinical manifestation were 
carried out with five BVDV isolates from an outbreak of mucosal disease (MD) 
(Outbreak #1), acute enteritis (Outbreaks #2 and #3) and generalized dermatitis 
(Outbreaks #4 and #5). Upon genetic analysis CP BVDV isolate of Outbreak #1 
clustered to closely to BVDV Oregon (Genotype 1). BVDV isolates from the 
outbreaks of generalized dermatitis (Outbreaks #4 and #5) were located close to 
BVDV Osloss within Genotype 1. The identification by immunohistochemistry of 
BVDV in exudative dermatitis indicates the epithelial cell tropism of the virus. 
Phylogenic characterization of BVDV from Outbreaks #2 and #3 locate them as 
BVDV-2. 5'UTR sequence of these viruses revealed a homology of 88 and 90% to 
BVDV-890 (Genotype 2) and a 77 and 75% to BVDV-SD1 (Genotype 1), respectively. 
The association of BVDV-2 with severe disease indicates the presence of highly 
virulent strains. Data from natural outbreaks where BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 were 
isolated revealed that pathology overlaps and not clearly allows the 
differentiation between genotypes based on gross or microscopic lesions. Thus, 
for a definitive diagnosis, further virology and molecular studies are 
necessary. Additionally, the results of this work focused on the origin and 
consequences of genetic variations of BVDV with regard to pathogenesis and 
suggest the association between genotype and a defined clinical syndrome.

Five cases of orf virus infection in Korean black goats were diagnosed in our 
laboratory between 2010 and 2011. One orf virus (ORF/2011) was isolated from an 
ovine testis cell line (OA3.Ts) for use as a vaccine candidate. Sequences of the 
major envelope protein and orf virus interferon resistance genes were determined 
and compared with published reference sequences. Phylogenetic analyses revealed 
that orf viruses from Korean black goats were most closely related to an isolate 
(ORF/09/Korea) from dairy goats in Korea. This result indicates that the orf 
viruses might have been introduced from dairy goats into the Korean black goat 
population.

Recently, 11 cases of animal rabies were reported in the southern region (Suwon 
and Hwaseong cities) of Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. The cases were 
temporally separated into two cases in dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in spring 
2012 and nine cases in domestic animals and wildlife in winter 2012-13. All 
carcasses were submitted for histopathologic examination and viral antigen 
identification. Sequences of the glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, and 
glycoprotein-large polymerase protein intergenic noncoding loci of the 11 
strains were determined and compared with published reference sequences. All 
rabies strains were closely related to the Gangwon strains isolated in 2008-09, 
suggesting that the rabies virus strains isolated in Gyeonggi were introduced 
from Gangwon Province.

An outbreak of a disease with parapox-like symptoms was reported in South Korea 
in April 2012. Three of 45 Korean native cattle, age 20-24 months, were 
affected. Parapoxviruses were detected and identified by electron microscopy and 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To determine the genetic characteristics of the 
Korean strains, the sequence of the major envelope protein (B2L) was determined 
and compared with published reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
that the parapoxvirus strains were closely related to not only isolates from 
Japan, but also isolates from Germany, Sudan and the United states. This is the 
first report on an outbreak and the molecular characterization of BPSV in Korea.

Foot-and-mouth disease in Asiatic black bears (<i>Ursus thibetanus</i>),"<jats:p> Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious, debilitating, and globally significant viral disease typically affecting cloven-hoofed hosts. The diagnosis of FMD in bears in Vietnam is described. The current study describes a confirmed case of FMD in a bear species, and the clinical signs compatible with FMD in a Malayan sun bear. Thirteen Asiatic black bears ( Ursus thibetanus) and 1 Malayan sun bear ( Helarctos malayanus) were apparently affected. In August 2011, an adult bear became lethargic, and developed footpad vesicles. Over 15 days, 14 out of 17 bears developed similar signs; the remaining 3 co-housed bears and another 57 resident bears did not. All affected bears developed vesicles on all footpads, and most were lethargic for 24–48 hr. Nasal and oral lesions were noted in 6 and 3 cases, respectively. Within 1 month, all looked normal. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, classified as serotype O, and isolated by virus isolation techniques. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clustering of 3 bear isolates, in a branch distinct from other FMDV type O isolates. The outbreak likely occurred due to indirect contact with livestock, and was facilitated by the high density of captive bears. It showed that Asiatic black bears are capable of contracting FMDV and developing clinical disease, and that the virus spreads easily between bears in close contact. </jats:p>",0
Two new subfamilies of DNA mismatch repair proteins (MutS) specifically abundant in the marine environment,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>MutS proteins are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and have important roles in DNA mismatch repair or recombination. In the virus world, the amoeba-infecting Mimivirus, as well as the recently sequenced Cafeteria roenbergensis virus are known to encode a MutS related to the homologs found in octocorals and ɛ-proteobacteria. To explore the presence of MutS proteins in other viral genomes, we performed a genomic survey of four giant viruses (‘giruses’) (Pyramimonas orientalis virus (PoV), Phaeocystis pouchetii virus (PpV), Chrysochromulina ericina virus (CeV) and Heterocapsa circularisquama DNA virus (HcDNAV)) that infect unicellular marine algae. Our analysis revealed the presence of a close homolog of Mimivirus MutS in all the analyzed giruses. These viral homologs possess a specific domain structure, including a C-terminal HNH-endonuclease domain, defining the new MutS7 subfamily. We confirmed the presence of conserved mismatch recognition residues in all members of the MutS7 subfamily, suggesting their role in DNA mismatch repair rather than DNA recombination. PoV and PpV were found to contain an additional type of MutS, which we propose to call MutS8. The MutS8 proteins in PoV and PpV were found to be closely related to homologs from ‘Candidatus Amoebophilus asiaticus’, an obligate intracellular amoeba-symbiont belonging to the Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that MutS7 and MutS8 are abundant in marine microbial metagenomes and that a vast majority of these environmental sequences are likely of girus origin. Giruses thus seem to represent a major source of the underexplored diversity of the MutS family in the microbial world.</jats:p>",0
Remarkable sequence similarity between the dinoflagellate-infecting marine girus and the terrestrial pathogen African swine fever virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Heterocapsa circularisquama</jats:italic> DNA virus (HcDNAV; previously designated as HcV) is a giant virus (girus) with a ~356-kbp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. HcDNAV lytically infects the bivalve-killing marine dinoflagellate <jats:italic>H. circularisquama</jats:italic>, and currently represents the sole DNA virus isolated from dinoflagellates, one of the most abundant protists in marine ecosystems. Its morphological features, genome type, and host range previously suggested that HcDNAV might be a member of the family <jats:italic>Phycodnaviridae</jats:italic> of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDVs), though no supporting sequence data was available. NCLDVs currently include two families found in aquatic environments (<jats:italic>Phycodnaviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Mimiviridae</jats:italic>), one mostly infecting terrestrial animals (<jats:italic>Poxviridae</jats:italic>), another isolated from fish, amphibians and insects (<jats:italic>Iridoviridae</jats:italic>), and the last one (<jats:italic>Asfarviridae</jats:italic>) exclusively represented by the animal pathogen African swine fever virus (ASFV), the agent of a fatal hemorrhagic disease in domestic swine. In this study, we determined the complete sequence of the type B DNA polymerase (PolB) gene of HcDNAV. The viral PolB was transcribed at least from 6 h post inoculation (hpi), suggesting its crucial function for viral replication. Most unexpectedly, the HcDNAV PolB sequence was found to be closely related to the PolB sequence of ASFV. In addition, the amino acid sequence of HcDNAV PolB showed a rare amino acid substitution within a motif containing highly conserved motif: Y<jats:underline>S</jats:underline> DTDS was found in HcDNAV PolB instead of Y<jats:underline>G</jats:underline> DTDS in most dsDNA viruses. Together with the previous observation of ASFV-like sequences in the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling metagenomic datasets, our results further reinforce the ideas that the terrestrial ASFV has its evolutionary origin in marine environments.</jats:p>",0
Complete genome and phylogenetic position of bovine papillomavirus type 7,"<jats:p>Six bovine papillomavirus (BPV) types and 16 putative BPV types have been reported previously. Here, the complete genome sequence of BAPV6, a novel putative BPV type isolated from cattle in Japan, was determined by using multiple-primed rolling-circle amplification. The genome consisted of 7412 bp (G+C content of 46 mol%) that encoded five early (E1, E2, E4, E6 and E7) and two late (L1 and L2) genes, but did not encode the E5 gene. The E6 protein contained a non-consensus CxxC(x)<jats:sub>33</jats:sub>CxxC and a consensus CxxC(x)<jats:sub>29</jats:sub>CxxC zinc-binding domain, and the E7 protein lacked the LxCxE motif. The nucleotide sequence of the L1 open reading frame (ORF) was related most closely (57–58 %) to the L1 ORF of member(s) of the genera <jats:italic>Betapapillomavirus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Gammapapillomavirus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Pipapillomavirus</jats:italic>. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete L1 ORF suggests that BAPV6 should be classified in a novel genus in the family <jats:italic>Papillomaviridae</jats:italic> as BPV-7.</jats:p>",0
The human gut virome: form and function,"<jats:p>Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies and the application of metagenomic approaches have fuelled an exponential increase in our understanding of the human gut microbiome. These approaches are now also illuminating features of the diverse and abundant collection of viruses (termed the virome) subsisting with the microbial ecosystems residing within the human holobiont. Here, we focus on the current and emerging knowledge of the human gut virome, in particular on viruses infecting bacteria (bacteriophage or phage), which are a dominant component of this viral community. We summarise current insights regarding the form and function of this ‘human gut phageome’ and highlight promising avenues for future research. In doing so, we discuss the potential for phage to drive ecological functioning and evolutionary change within this important microbial ecosystem, their contribution to modulation of host–microbiome interactions and stability of the community as a whole, as well as the potential role of the phageome in human health and disease. We also consider the emerging concepts of a ‘core healthy gut phageome’ and the putative existence of ‘viral enterotypes’ and ‘viral dysbiosis’.</jats:p>",0

Maedi/visna (MV) is a lentiviral disease of sheep caused by the maedi/visna 
virus (MVV). Although MV is prevalent in many countries, it had not been 
reported in Japan. In 2011, however, three sheep in northern Japan were reported 
to be seropositive against the MVV antigen, indicating a persistent MVV 
infection. In the present study, we isolated MVV from one sheep to confirm MVV 
infection and conducted genomic classification of the virus. The co-culture of 
leukocytes from a seropositive sheep with fetal goat lung cells resulted in the 
formation of syncytial cells and the amplification of a long terminal repeat 
sequence of MVV by polymerase chain reaction. The isolate was confirmed as being 
MVV, rather than the caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus based on phylogenetic 
analysis of the gag gene sequence. Although the sheep was asymptomatic, 
nonpurulent meningitis and demyelination were found in the spinal cord. These 
were considered to be early lesions associated with pathogenic MVV infection. 
Therefore, the present study demonstrated that MVV is distributed in Japan.

Evidence of an Antigenic Shift among Palyam Serogroup Orbiviruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The Japanese isolates of Palyam serogroup viruses isolated from 1985 to 2001 were investigated for the genome sequence of segments 2 and 7 and were phylogenetically analyzed in comparison with Australian and African isolates of the same serogroup. The nucleotide sequences of segment 7 were highly conserved within Japanese isolates (95.1 to 100%) and between Japanese and Taiwanese isolates (96.0 to 100%), whereas the identities between Japanese and Taiwanese isolates and Australian and African isolates were fairly conserved (84.2 to 92.0%). Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 7 revealed three clusters according to geographical origin. As a result of the nucleotide sequence analysis of segment 2, which encodes a serotype-specific antigen, Japanese isolates were classified into two groups by genome length and nucleotide identities. Four of the nine Japanese isolates were categorized into the same group as prototype strain K-47 of the Chuzan virus, and the remaining isolates were categorized into the same group as the D'Aguilar virus and Nyabira virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 2 revealed two clusters, the cluster containing Chuzan virus and the cluster containing the D'Aguilar and Nyabira viruses. To examine the antigenic relationship among viruses categorized in different clusters, we conducted a cross-neutralization test. KSB-29/E/01, isolated in 2001 in Japan, was neutralized by antiserum not only to strain B8112 of D'Aguilar virus but also to Chuzan virus. These results indicated that genetically and antigenically unique characteristics of KSB-29/E/01 were attributed to genetic reassortment of segment 2 between Chuzan virus and D'Aguilar virus.</jats:p>",0

Minute virus of canines (MVC), also known as canine parvovirus (CPV) type 1, is 
an autonomous parvovirus that infects domestic dogs worldwide and responsible 
for clinical problems of neonates and pregnant bitches. It was preliminary 
described that MVC is antigenically as well as genetically different from CPV 
type 2 that emerged later. However, much of MVC is still obscure since only a 
limited number of MVC isolates have been available for the study. MVC infections 
of Japanese and Korean dogs were epidemiologically studied in the previous 
study, and several MVC isolates could be cultivated in vitro. In the present 
study an almost full-length nucleotide sequence of a Korean MVC strain HM-6 
genome was obtained and comparatively analyzed with those of the American MVC 
strain GA3 characterized recently. Genome structure of the HM-6 strain was 
similar to the GA3 strain showing 96.4% identity at the nucleotide sequence. 
Each of the deduced amino acid sequences of NS1, NP-1, and VP1/2 showed homology 
of 96.5%, 92.5%, and 97.5% between the HM-6 and GA3 strains. When compared with 
other parvovirus species, the HM-6 strain was most closely related to bovine 
parvovirus (BPV) as described for the GA3 strain. These results suggest that MVC 
together with BPV can possibly be classified into a new clade in the 
Parvovirinae subfamily.

BACKGROUND: Pseudocowpox virus (PCPV) infects cattle worldwide with zoonotic 
potential but has not been isolated in Japan. Thus, the epidemiological status 
of PCPV infection in cattle is undetermined.
RESULTS: In May 2016, a cattle in a farm in Yamaguchi Prefecture showed white 
vesicles and hyperemia in the mucosa under the tongue surface, but not on the 
teats and coronary cushions. A parapoxvirus was isolated from the oral lesion 
swab and was genetically characterized based on the full-length sequence of B2L 
gene encoding viral envelope. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolated 
virus was classified into PCPV.
CONCLUSION: This case indicates its potential spread in Japan. This is the first 
report of isolation of PCPV in Japan.

Sapoviruses (SaVs) are enteric caliciviruses that have been detected in multiple 
mammalian species, including humans, pigs, mink, dogs, sea lions, chimpanzees, 
and rats. They show a high level of diversity. A SaV genome commonly encodes 
seven nonstructural proteins (NSs), including the RNA polymerase protein NS7, 
and two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2). We classified human and animal SaVs 
into 15 genogroups (G) based on available VP1 sequences, including three newly 
characterized genomes from this study. We sequenced the full length genomes of 
one new genogroup V (GV), one GVII and one GVIII porcine SaV using long range 
RT-PCR including newly designed forward primers located in the conserved motifs 
of the putative NS3, and also 5' RACE methods. We also determined the 5'- and 
3'-ends of sea lion GV SaV and canine GXIII SaV. Although the complete genomic 
sequences of GIX-GXII, and GXV SaVs are unavailable, common features of SaV 
genomes include: 1) ""GTG"" at the 5'-end of the genome, and a short (9~14 nt) 
5'-untranslated region; and 2) the first five amino acids (M [A/V] S [K/R] P) of 
the putative NS1 and the five amino acids (FEMEG) surrounding the putative 
cleavage site between NS7 and VP1 were conserved among the chimpanzee, two of 
five genogroups of pig (GV and GVIII), sea lion, canine, and human SaVs. In 
contrast, these two amino acid motifs were clearly different in three genogroups 
of porcine (GIII, GVI and GVII), and bat SaVs. Our results suggest that several 
animal SaVs have genetic similarities to human SaVs. However, the ability of 
SaVs to be transmitted between humans and animals is uncertain.

A total of 1481 fecal specimens were collected from diarrheic calves under 1 
month of age on 29 dairy and beef farms in 11 prefectures in Japan during the 
period from 1987 to 2000. Those calves and their dams were not vaccinated 
against rotavirus. One hundred and forty-two bovine rotaviruses were isolated on 
MA-104 cell cultures and detected by latex agglutination test. They were 
classified into 18 G6P[1] (11.2%), 53 G6P[5] (37.3%), 15 G6P[11] (10.6%), 12 
G10P[5] (8.5%), 42 G10P[11] (29.6%) and 1 G8P[11] (0.7%) by reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. One serotype G8 virus was untypable for 
the P genotype suggesting a new type of bovine origin. The least common G8 
serotype viruses were isolated from the samples of farms from Niigata and 
Tokushima prefectures. The VP7 gene sequences of the two isolates exhibited a 
high degree of homology as well as previously reported G8 viruses with 
93.3-98.8% identity of deduced amino acids. A phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 
gene of the two G8 viruses and 13 previously reported G8 viruses by the 
neighbor-joining method indicated that the two newly isolated G8 rotaviruses had 
a common origin and they were assigned to a new disparate cluster.

To estimate the prevalence of avian influenza virus infection in Vietnam, 
surveillance was conducted in domestic and wild birds from households, live-bird 
markets, slaughtering sites, and bird sanctuaries in Vietnam between October 
2010 and October 2012. Of the 4,550 samples collected, 226 influenza A virus 
isolates were obtained from domestic ducks, muscovy ducks, and chickens. Of 
these, 25 and 22 H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) were 
isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in live-bird markets and 
slaughtering sites in northern and southern Vietnam, respectively. The HA genes 
of H5 viruses isolated from birds in northern Vietnam phylogenetically belonged 
to the genetic clade 2.3.2.1 and those in southern Vietnam belonged to the 
genetic clade 1.1. In addition, 39 H3, 12 H4, 1 H5, 93 H6, 2 H7, 18 H9, 3 H10, 
and 11 H11 viruses were isolated. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the H6 
and H9 viruses revealed that they were closely related to the isolates obtained 
from domestic poultry in China. Phylogenetic analyses of internal gene segments 
of these isolates revealed that these viruses were circulating in both domestic 
and wild birds in Asia and reassortment events had occurred frequently. 
Therefore, it will be important to continue the surveillance and strict controls 
over the movement and trade of poultry and poultry products in order to 
eradicate H5N1 HPAIV from Asia.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the sole member of the genus Hepevirus in the family 
Hepeviridae. HEV is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route, and 
water-borne epidemics are characteristic of hepatitis E in many developing 
countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America where sanitation conditions are 
suboptimal. Accumulating lines of evidence indicate that HEV-associated 
hepatitis also occurs domestically among individuals in industrialized 
countries, that there are animal reservoirs of HEV such as domestic pigs and 
wild boars, and that hepatitis E is a zoonosis. Based on the extensive genomic 
variability among HEV isolates, HEV sequences have been classified into four 
genotypes: genotype 1 consists of epidemic strains in developing countries in 
Asia and Africa; genotype 2 has been described in Mexico and several African 
countries; genotype 3 HEV is widely distributed and has been isolated from 
sporadic cases of acute hepatitis E and/or domestic pigs in many countries in 
the world, except for countries in Africa; and genotype 4 contains strains 
isolated from humans and/or domestic pigs exclusively in Asian countries. This 
paper reviews current knowledge on the genomic variability, geographic 
distribution and zoonotic aspects of HEV as well as the clinical significance of 
genotype and evolution of HEV.

Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) are important not only for pig farming, but also 
for public health. In fact, pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses [A(H1N1)pdm09] were 
derived from SIVs. Therefore, timely characterization of locally circulating 
SIVs is necessary for understanding the global status of SIVs. To genetically 
characterize SIVs circulating in Japanese pig populations, we isolated 24 SIVs 
of three subtypes (17 H1N1, four H1N2 and three H3N2 strains) from 14 pig farms 
in Japan from 2013 to 2016. Genetic analyses revealed that the haemagglutinin 
(HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the 17 H1N1 and the HA gene of one H1N2, 
A/swine/Aichi/02/2016 (H1N2), SIVs belonged to the A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage. More 
importantly, all of the remaining six gene segments (i.e., PB1, PB1, PA, NP, M 
and NS) of the 24 SIVs, regardless of the HA and NA subtype, were also 
classified as belonging to the A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage. These results indicate that 
gene segments of A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage are widely distributed in SIVs circulating 
in Japanese pig populations In addition, the NA gene of A/swine/Aichi/02/2016 
(H1N2) shared less than 88.5% nucleotide identity with that of the closest 
relative A/swine/Miyagi/5/2003 (H1N2), which was isolated in Japan in 2003. 
These results indicate the sustained circulation of classical H1N2-derived SIVs 
with remarkable diversity in the NA genes in Japanese pig populations. These 
findings highlight the necessity of both intensive biosecurity systems and 
active SIV surveillance in pig populations worldwide for both animal and public 
health.

Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute viral respiratory disease, 
primarily of chickens. Economic losses attributable to ILT affect many 
poultry-producing areas throughout the United States (US) and the world. Despite 
efforts to control the disease by vaccination, prolonged epidemics of ILT remain 
a threat to the poultry industry. Earlier epidemiological and molecular evidence 
indicated that outbreaks in the US are caused by vaccine-related strains. In 
this study, polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment polymorphism 
(PCR-RFLP) of four genome regions was utilized to characterize 25 isolates from 
commercial poultry and backyard flocks from the US. Combinations of PCR-RFLP 
patterns classified the ILT virus isolates into nine groups. Backyard flock 
isolates were categorized in three separate groups. The ILT virus US Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) reference strain and the tissue culture origin (TCO) 
vaccine strain were categorized into two separate groups. Twenty-two isolates 
from commercial poultry were categorized into four groups: one group, of six 
isolates, showed patterns identical to the chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines; 
a second group, of nine isolates, differed in only one pattern from the CEO 
vaccines; a third group, of two isolates, differed in only one pattern from the 
TCO vaccine; a fourth group, of five isolates, differed in six and nine patterns 
from the CEO and TCO vaccines, respectively. Results obtained from this study 
clearly demonstrated that most of the commercial poultry isolates (17 of 22 
isolates) were closely related to the vaccine strains. However, isolates 
different to the vaccine strains were also identified in commercial poultry.

Small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infections are widespread in Poland and 
circulation of subtypes A1, A12, A13, B1 and B2 was detected. The present work 
aimed at extending previous study based on the analysis of a larger number of 
animals from single-species flocks. Animals were selected for genetic analysis 
based on serological reactivity towards a range of recombinant antigens derived 
from Gag and Env viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of 
subtypes B2 and A12 in both goats and sheep and subtypes A1 and B1 in goats 
only. In addition, two novel subtypes, A16 and A17, were found in goats. 
Co-infections with strains belonging to different subtypes within A and B groups 
were detected in 1 sheep and 4 goats originating from four flocks. Although the 
reactivity of serum samples towards the recombinant antigens confirmed 
immunological relatedness between Gag epitopes of different subtypes and the 
cross-reactive nature of Gag antibodies, eleven serum samples failed to react 
with antigens representing all subtypes detected up-to-date in Poland, 
highlighting the limitations of the serological diagnosis. These data showed the 
complex nature of SRLV subtypes circulating in sheep and goats in Poland and the 
need for improving SRLV-related diagnostic capacity.

Porcine B-cells recognize epitopes that are conserved between the structural proteins of American- and European-type porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus,"<jats:p>By selecting phage display libraries with immune sera from experimentally infected pigs, porcine B-cell epitopes in the open reading frame (ORF) 2, 3, 5 and 6 proteins of European-type porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were identified. The sequences of all the epitopes were well conserved in European-type PRRSV and even between European- and American-type PRRSV. Accordingly, sera from pigs infected with American-type PRRSV cross-reacted with the European-type epitopes. Thus, this study showed, for the first time, the presence of highly conserved epitopes in the matrix protein and envelope glycoproteins of PRRSV. ORF5 and 6 epitopes localized to protein parts that are predicted to be hidden in PRRSV virions. In contrast, ORF2 and 3 epitopes localized to putative protein ectodomains. Due to the interesting localization, the sequence surrounding the ORF2 and 3 epitopes was subjected to closer scrutiny. A heptad motif, VSRRIYQ, which is present in a single copy in ORF2 and 3 proteins, was identified; this arrangement is completely conserved in all European-type PRRSV sequences available. The VSRRIYQ repeat motif colocalized closely with one of the ORF2 epitopes and secondary structure modelling showed that this segment of the ORF2 protein could form an amphipathic helix. Intriguingly, a mutation associated with virulence/attenuation of an American vaccine strain of PRRSV also localized to this ORF2 protein segment and affected the hydrophobic face of the predicted amphipathic helix. Further work is needed to determine whether these findings delineate a functional domain in the PRRSV ORF2 protein.</jats:p>",0

The classical swine fever (CSF) epidemic in the Netherlands in 1997-1998 lasted 
14 months, during which 429 infected and 1300 at risk herds were culled, at an 
estimated economical cost of 2 billion US dollars. Despite the overwhelming 
scale of the epizootic, the CSF virus (CSFV) strain causing the outbreak has 
remained largely uncharacterized. The Dutch epizootic is epidemiologically 
linked to a small CSF outbreak in 1997, in Paderborn in Germany. E2 and partial 
5' NTR sequencing has shown that the index Paderborn isolate, and several Dutch 
isolates taken during the 1997-1998 epizootic, are virtually identical, 
confirming that the Paderborn isolate triggered the Dutch outbreak, and 
furthermore showing that this single isolate was stable throughout the whole 
Dutch outbreak (the above reviewed in [C. Terpstra, A. J. de Smit, Veterinary 
Microbiol. 77 (2000) 3-15]). We determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5' NTR 
(by 5' RACE) and the complete open reading frame of the Paderborn isolate 
(GenBank AY072924). Our sequence was identical to previously published partial 
5'NTR and E2 sequences for the index Paderborn 1997 and Dutch 1997 (Venhorst) 
isolates, confirming the identity of the virus we sequenced. Phylogenetic 
analysis based on the complete open reading frame showed that Paderborn is 
genetically very different from common European laboratory reference strains. 
Neutralization studies showed that Paderborn is also antigenically very 
different from common laboratory strains such as Alfort 187. Paderborn is the 
only recent European CSFV field isolate for which a complete sequence is 
available, and given Paderborns genetic and antigenic uniqueness, the Paderborn 
sequence may have practical use for diagnostic and vaccine antigen development.

Many HEV and HEV-like sequences have been reported during the last years, 
including isolates which may represent a number of potential new genera, new 
genotypes or new subtypes within the family Hepeviridae. Using the most common 
classification system, difficulties in the establishment of subtypes have been 
reported. Moreover the relevance of subtype classification for epidemiology can 
be questioned. In this study we have performed phylogenetic analyses based on 
whole capsid gene and complete HEV genomic sequences in order to evaluate the 
current classification of HEV at genotype and subtype levels. The results of our 
analyses modify the current taxonomy of genotype 3 and refine the established 
system for typing of HEV. In addition we suggest a classification for 
hepeviruses recently isolated from bats, ferrets, rats and wild boar.

An H1N2 influenza virus (A/Duck/North Carolina/91347/01) (Dk/NC) was isolated 
from a wild duck in the United States in 2001. Genetic analyses showed that this 
duck virus has the same human/classical swine/avian reassortant genotype as the 
H1N2 viruses that have been isolated from pigs and turkeys in the US since 1999. 
Phylogenetic analyses of each gene segment further confirmed that the Dk/NC 
virus is closely related to the domestic animal H1N2 isolates. In particular, 
Dk/NC is most closely related to a swine H1N2 virus also isolated in North 
Carolina. These two viruses and a phylogenetically-defined subset of additional 
swine H1N2 viruses share a common mutation in the Sb antigenic site on the 
hemagglutinin protein. The recovery of Dk/NC from a wild bird raises concerns 
for further widespread distribution of these H1N2 viruses via waterfowl 
migration.

               <jats:p>
                  <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Following six passages of PPMV-1 in chickens, 10 nonsynonymous substitutions were found including one (in the NP protein) which dominated the genetic pool of viral quasispecies.

                  <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> PPMV-1 is highly adapted to pigeons and passaging through chickens results in the acquisition of novel amino acids in the polymerase complex, which may alter the pathogenic potential of the virus.</jats:p>",0

Chicken anemia virus (CAV) is a widespread chicken pathogen of significant 
economic importance. In 2013, broiler chicken flocks in Poland were examined for 
the presence of CAV, and phylogenetic relatedness between the strains was 
established. Ten cloacal swabs from each of 106 broiler flocks (birds aged 3-6 
wk) were collected in different regions of the country and tested with the use 
of real-time PCR (all samples) and conventional PCR (those samples positive in 
real-time PCR) assays. The presence of CAV was detected in 16 of the flocks 
tested. Phylogenetic analysis clearly confirmed the existence of genetic 
diversity within the group of circulating CAV strains and their distinctiveness 
from vaccine strains used in Poland.

Changes in livestock production systems in recent years have altered the 
presentation of many diseases resulting in the need for more sophisticated 
control measures. At the same time, new molecular assays have been developed to 
support the diagnosis of animal viral disease. Nucleotide sequences generated by 
these diagnostic techniques can be used in phylogenetic analysis to infer 
phenotypes by sequence homology and to perform molecular epidemiology studies. 
In this review, some key elements of phylogenetic analysis are highlighted, such 
as the selection of the appropriate neutral phylogenetic marker, the proper 
phylogenetic method and different techniques to test the reliability of the 
resulting tree. Examples are given of current and future applications of 
phylogenetic reconstructions in viral livestock diseases.

Goat diarrheal feces were subjected to metagenome analysis by the 
next-generation sequencing. Nucleotide sequences with homology to enteroviruses 
were obtained. Primers for RT-PCR were designed based on the nucleotide sequence 
of these sequences at the 5'-untranslated region, and we determined 563 bp 
nucleotide sequences that showed homology to bovine-like and ovine enteroviruses 
(77-87 %). We named the virus detected in this study goat enterovirus G1 
(GEV-G1). In the phylogenetic analysis, GEV-G1 belonged to a cluster containing 
ovine enteroviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first report on nucleotide 
sequences of an enterovirus infecting Japanese goats.

Host-independent evolution and a genetic classification of the hepadnavirus family based on nucleotide sequences.,"<jats:p>An analysis of molecular phylogeny was undertaken to examine whether the evolution of the hepadnavirus family is host-dependent. Using the nucleotide sequences of 18 strains, we constructed phylogenetic trees. The trees obtained show that all 12 strains of hepatitis B virus can be classified into four subgroups that are not compatible with conventional subtypes. We estimated the rate of synonymous (silent) substitution for hepatitis B virus to be 4.57 x 10(-5) per site per year. Applying this rate to the phylogenetic tree, we estimated that duck hepatitis B virus diverged from a common ancestor about 30,000 years ago at the earliest, that woodchuck hepatitis virus and ground squirrel hepatitis virus diverged about 10,000 years ago, and that hepatitis B virus diverged within the last 3000 years. Because these divergence times of the viruses are much more recent than those of the host species, it suggests that the hepadnavirus family evolved independently of host-species divergence.</jats:p>",0

Since the global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 during 
2005-2006, control programs have been successfully implemented in most affected 
countries. HPAI H5N1 was first reported in Bangladesh in 2007, and since then 
546 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE. The disease has apparently become 
endemic in Bangladesh. Spatio-temporal information on 177 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 
occurring between February 2010 and April 2011 in Bangladesh, and 37 of these 
outbreaks in which isolated H5N1 viruses were phylogenetically characterized to 
clade, were analyzed. Three clades were identified, 2.2 (21 cases), 2.3.4 (2 
cases) and 2.3.2.1 (14 cases). Clade 2.2 was identified throughout the time 
period and was widely distributed in a southeast-northwest orientation. Clade 
2.3.2.1 appeared later and was generally confined to central Bangladesh in a 
north-south orientation. Based on a direction test, clade 2.2 viruses spread in 
a southeast-to-northwest direction, whereas clade 2.3.2.1 spread west-to-east. 
The magnitude of spread of clade 2.3.2.1 was greater relative to clade 2.2 
(angular concentration 0.2765 versus 0.1860). In both cases, the first 
outbreak(s) were identified as early outliers, but in addition, early outbreaks 
(one each) of clade 2.2 were also identified in central Bangladesh and in 
northwest Bangladesh, a considerable distance apart. The spread of highly 
pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in Bangladesh is characterized by reported 
long-distance translocation events. This poses a challenge to disease control 
efforts. Increased enforcement of biosecurity and stronger control of movements 
between affected farms and susceptible farms, and better surveillance and 
reporting, is needed. Although the movement of poultry and equipment appears to 
be a more likely explanation for the patterns identified, the relative 
contribution of trade and the market chain versus wild birds in spreading the 
disease needs further investigation.

Chicken infectious anaemia (CIA) is a disease with a highly economic impact in 
the poultry industry. The infected chickens are characterized by aplastic 
anaemia and extreme immunosuppression, followed by the increased susceptibility 
to secondary infectious pathogens and suboptimal immune responses for 
vaccination. Commercially available CIA vaccines are routinely used in the 
breeders in Taiwan to protect their progeny with maternal-derived antibodies. 
However, CIA cases still occur in the field and little is known about the 
genetic characteristics of Taiwanese chicken anaemia viruses (CAVs). In this 
study, CAV DNA was detected in 72 of 137 flocks collected during 2010-2015. 
Among the PCR-positive samples, the coding regions of 51 CAVs were sequenced. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene revealed that, although most of Taiwanese 
CAVs belonged to genotypes II and III, some isolates were clustered into a novel 
genotype (genotype IV). Moreover, a Taiwanese isolate in this novel genotype IV 
appeared to be derived from a recombination event between genotypes II and III 
viruses. Five Taiwanese CAV isolates were highly similar to the vaccine strains, 
26P4 or Del-Ros. Taken together, these results indicate that the sequences of 
CAVs in Taiwan are variable, and inter-genotypic recombination had occurred 
between viruses of different genotypes. Moreover, vaccine-like strains might 
induce clinical signs of CIA in chickens. Our findings could be useful for 
understanding the evolution of CAVs and development of a better control strategy 
for CIA.

During the 2016-2017 winter season, we isolated 33 highly pathogenic avian 
influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of H5N6 subtype and three low pathogenic avian 
influenza viruses (LPAIVs) from debilitated or dead wild birds, duck faeces, and 
environmental water samples collected in the Izumi plain, an overwintering site 
for migratory birds in Japan. Genetic analyses of the H5N6 HPAIV isolates 
revealed previously unreported phylogenetic variations in the PB2, PB1, PA, and 
NS gene segments and allowed us to propose two novel genotypes for the 
contemporary H5N6 HPAIVs. In addition, analysis of the four gene segments 
identified close phylogenetic relationships between our three LPAIV isolates and 
the contemporary H5N6 HPAIV isolates. Our results implied the co-circulation and 
co-evolution of HPAIVs and LPAIVs within the same wild bird populations, thereby 
highlighting the importance of avian influenza surveillance targeting not only 
for HPAIVs but also for LPAIVs.

Genetic and epidemiological insights into the emergence of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) across Asia and Africa,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Small ruminants are important components in the livelihood of millions of households in many parts of the world. The spread of the highly contagious peste des petits ruminants (PPR) disease, which is caused by an RNA virus, PPRV, across Asia and Africa remains a major concern. The present study explored the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of PPRV through the analyses of partial N-gene and F-gene sequences of the virus. All the four previously described PPRV lineages (I-IV) diverged from their common ancestor during the late-19<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>to early-20<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>century. Among the four lineages, PPRV-IV showed pronounced genetic structuring across the region; however, haplotype sharing among the geographic regions, together with the presence of multiple genetic clusters within a country, indicates the possibility of frequent mobility of the diseased individuals across the region. The gradual decline in the effective number of infections suggests a limited genetic variation, which could be attributed to the effective vaccination that has been practiced since 1990s. However, the movement of infected animals across the region likely contributes to the spread of PPRV-IV. No evidence of positive selection was identified from this study.</jats:p>",0

Understanding the genetic basis of viral adaptation to taxonomically diverse 
groups of host species inhabiting different eco-climatic zones is crucial for 
the discovery of factors underpinning the successful establishment of these 
infectious pathogens in new hosts/environments. To gain insights into the 
dynamics of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) and the ratio 
between the two (ω=dN/dS), we analyzed the complete nucleotide coding sequence 
data of the M segment, which encodes glycoproteins of two negative-sense RNA 
viruses, Akabane virus (AKV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) that belong to the 
same serogroup. While AKV is relatively older and has been circulating in 
ruminant populations since 1970s, SBV was first reported in 2011. The ω was 
estimated to be 1.67 and 0.09 for SBV and AKV, respectively, and the estimated 
mutation rate of SBV is at least 25 times higher than that of AKV. Given the 
different evolutionary stages of the two viruses, most of the slightly 
deleterious mutations were likely purged out or kept in low frequency in the AKV 
genome, whereas positive selection together with the accumulation of slightly 
deleterious mutations might contribute to such an inflated mutation rate of SBV. 
The evolutionary distance (d) is nonlinearly and negatively correlated with ω, 
but is positively correlated with dN and dS. Collectively, the different 
patterns in ω, dN, dS, and d between AKV and SBV identified in this study 
provide empirical evidence for a time-dependent selection pressure.

Metagenomic sequencing of three nasal swabs collected from 10- to 21-day-old 
pigs exhibiting unexplained acute respiratory disease from two different 
commercial production facilities in Oklahoma identified a novel genotype of 
porcine astrovirus 4 (PAstV-4). The genomes had only ~75 % nucleotide sequence 
identity to previously characterized PAstV-4 isolates, while the capsid-encoding 
ORF2 had only ~53 % amino acid sequence identity to reference strains. A TaqMan 
assay targeting the novel ORF2 gene found 21 % and 19 % incidence in nasal and 
fecal swabs, respectively, submitted for unrelated diagnostic testing. PAstV-4 
RNA levels were significantly higher (P = 0.04) in nasal swabs, suggesting a 
possible atypical respiratory tropism.

The feral swine (FS) originated from the domestic pig and is present throughout 
the Brazilian wetland plain (the Pantanal). Aujeszky's disease (AD) was first 
serologically confirmed in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) in 2001; 
however, there was no viral confirmation. The aim of this study was to 
investigate antibodies against-SuHV-1 in the sera of feral swine in the studied 
areas, detect SuHV-1 through PCR and classify the viral genome. Among the 218 
animals sampled, 186 were analyzed by ELISA, resulting in 88 (47.3%) reactive 
samples. In the serum neutralization test (SN), 57/179 (31.8%) samples presented 
antibodies against the AD virus (SuHV-1). By nested PCR, 104 DNA samples were 
extracted for analysis and confirmed with amplification of a fragment of 
glycoprotein B (gB) in five samples. The SuHV-1 was detected in 12 samples by 
using primers for glycoprotein E (gE) and viral genome was classified as Type I 
by ul44 partial sequencing. The amplification of SuHV-1 glycoprotein fragments 
in the fetuses of seropositive sows indicate that the vertical transmission 
contribute to maintain SuHV-1 in a free-living feral swine population. The 
origin of AD in the feral swine populations of the Pantanal is unknown, however, 
the determination of viral latency, the vertical transmission of the antigen by 
the amplification of SuHV-1 glycoprotein fragments in the fetuses of 
seropositive sows and genome typing contribute to the elucidation of the 
epidemiology of this disease in the wetlands of MS, Brazil.

Heart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation of Farmed Salmon Is Associated with Infection with a Novel Reovirus,"1. PLoS One. 2010 Jul 9;5(7):e11487. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0011487.

Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) mariculture has been associated with epidemics 
of infectious diseases that threaten not only local production, but also wild 
fish coming into close proximity to marine pens and fish escaping from them. 
Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is a frequently fatal disease of 
farmed Atlantic salmon. First recognized in one farm in Norway in 1999, HSMI was 
subsequently implicated in outbreaks in other farms in Norway and the United 
Kingdom. Although pathology and disease transmission studies indicated an 
infectious basis, efforts to identify an agent were unsuccessful. Here we 
provide evidence that HSMI is associated with infection with piscine reovirus 
(PRV). PRV is a novel reovirus identified by unbiased high throughput DNA 
sequencing and a bioinformatics program focused on nucleotide frequency as well 
as sequence alignment and motif analyses. Formal implication of PRV in HSMI will 
require isolation in cell culture and fulfillment of Koch's postulates, or 
prevention or modification of disease through use of specific drugs or vaccines. 
Nonetheless, as our data indicate that a causal relationship is plausible, 
measures must be taken to control PRV not only because it threatens domestic 
salmon production but also due to the potential for transmission to wild salmon 
populations.

Samples collected in 2008 and 2009, from 49 turkey flocks of 6 to 43 days in age 
and presenting clinical signs of enteric disease and high mortality, were tested 
by polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
for the presence of viruses currently associated with enteric disease (ED) 
syndromes: astrovirus, reovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and 
parvovirus. Turkey astroviruses were found in 83.67% of the cases and turkey 
astrovirus 2 (TAst-2) in 26.53%. The investigations directly demonstrated the 
high prevalence of turkey parvovirus (TuPV) in 23 flocks (46.9%) experiencing 
signs of ED, making this pathogen the second most identified after astroviruses. 
Phylogenetic analysis on a 527 base pair-long region from the NS1 gene revealed 
two main clusters, a chicken parvovirus (ChPV) and a TuPV group, but also the 
presence of a divergent branch of tentatively named ""TuPV-like ChPV"" strains. 
The 23 Hungarian TuPV strains were separately positioned in two groups from the 
American origin sequences in the TuPV cluster. An Avail-based restriction 
fragment length polymorphism assay has also been developed for the quick 
differentiation of TuPV, ChPV, and divergent TuPV-like ChPV strains. As most 
detected enteric viruses have been directly demonstrated in healthy turkey 
flocks as well, the epidemiology of this disease complex remains unclear, 
suggesting that a certain combination of pathogens, environmental factors, or 
both are necessary for the development of clinical signs.

Cowpea, (Vigna unguiculata L. (Walp)) is an annual tropical grain legume. Often 
referred to as ""poor man's meat"", cowpea is one of the most important 
subsistence legumes cultivated in West Africa due to the high protein content of 
its seeds. However, African cowpea production can be seriously constrained by 
viral diseases that reduce yields. While twelve cowpea-infecting viruses have 
been reported from Africa, only three of these have so-far been reported from 
Burkina Faso. Here we use a virion-associated nucleic acids (VANA)-based 
metagenomics method to screen for the presence of cowpea viruses from plants 
collected from the three agro-climatic zones of Burkina Faso. Besides the three 
cowpea-infecting virus species which have previously been reported from Burkina 
Faso (Cowpea aphid borne mosaic virus [Family Potyviridae], the Blackeye cowpea 
mosaic virus-a strain of Bean common mosaic virus-[Family Potyviridae] and 
Cowpea mottle virus [Family Tombusviridae]) five additional viruses were 
identified: Southern cowpea mosaic virus (Sobemovirus genus), two previously 
uncharacterised polerovirus-like species (Family Luteoviridae), a previously 
uncharacterised tombusvirus-like species (Family Tombusviridae) and a previously 
uncharacterised mycotymovirus-like species (Family Tymoviridae). Overall, 
potyviruses were the most prevalent cowpea viruses (detected in 65.5% of 
samples) and the Southern Sudan zone of Burkina Faso was found to harbour the 
greatest degrees of viral diversity and viral prevalence. Partial genome 
sequences of the two novel polerovirus-like and tombusvirus-like species were 
determined and RT-PCR primers were designed for use in Burkina Faso to routinely 
detect all of these cowpea-associated viruses.

A Novel Porcine Circovirus Distantly Related to Known Circoviruses Is Associated with Porcine Dermatitis and Nephropathy Syndrome and Reproductive Failure,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) is clinically manifested by postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), respiratory and enteric disease, reproductive failure, and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an essential component of PCVAD, although an etiologic role in PDNS is not well established. Here, a novel circovirus, designated porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3), was identified in sows that died acutely with PDNS-like clinical signs. The capsid and replicase proteins of PCV3 are only 37% and 55% identical to PCV2 and bat circoviruses, respectively. Aborted fetuses from sows with PDNS contained high levels of PCV3 (7.57 × 10
            <jats:sup>7</jats:sup>
            genome copies/ml), and no other viruses were detected by PCR and metagenomic sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of sow tissue samples identified PCV3 antigen in skin, kidney, lung, and lymph node samples localized in typical PDNS lesions, including necrotizing vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Further study of archived PDNS tissue samples that were negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis identified 45 of 48 that were PCV3 positive by quantitative PCR (qPCR), with 60% of a subset also testing positive for PCV3 by IHC analysis. Analysis by qPCR of 271 porcine respiratory disease diagnostic submission samples identified 34 PCV3-positive cases (12.5%), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of anti-PCV3 capsid antibodies in serum samples found that 46 (55%) of 83 samples tested were positive. These results suggest that PCV3 commonly circulates within U.S. swine and may play an etiologic role in reproductive failure and PDNS. Because of the high economic impact of PCV2, this novel circovirus warrants further studies to elucidate its significance and role in PCVAD.

            While porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) was first identified in sporadic cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in Canada in the early 1990s, an epidemic of severe systemic disease due to PCV2 spread worldwide in the ensuing decade. Despite being effectively controlled by commercial vaccines, PCV2 remains one of the most economically significant viruses of swine. Here, a novel porcine circovirus (PCV3) that is distantly related to known circoviruses was identified in sows with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) and reproductive failure. PCV2, which has previously been associated with these clinical presentations, was not identified. High levels of PCV3 nucleic acid were observed in aborted fetuses by quantitative PCR, and PCV3 antigen was localized in histologic lesions typical of PDNS in sows by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. PCV3 was also identified in archival PDNS diagnostic samples that previously tested negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis. The emergence of PCV3 warrants further investigation.

Parvoviruses are a diverse group of viruses containing some of the smallest 
known species that are capable of infecting a wide range of animals. Metagenomic 
sequencing of pooled rectal swabs from adult pigs identified a 4103-bp contig 
consisting of two major open reading frames encoding proteins of 672 and 469 
amino acids (aa) in length. BLASTP analysis of the 672-aa protein found 42.4 % 
identity to fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) parvovirus 2 (EhPV2) and 37.9 % to turkey 
parvovirus (TuPV) TP1-2012/HUN NS1 proteins. The 469-aa protein had no 
significant similarity to known proteins. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses 
suggest that PPV7, EhPV2, and TuPV represent a novel genus in the family 
Parvoviridae. Quantitative PCR screening of 182 porcine diagnostic samples found 
a total of 16 positives (8.6 %). Together, these data suggest that PPV7 is a 
highly divergent novel parvovirus prevalent within the US swine.

Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is a herpesvirus that causes an acute, contagious, 
and fatal disease. In the present article, the DEV UL5 gene was cloned and 
sequenced from a vaccine virus. According to the consensus sequence of 
herpesvirus UL5 and UL3 gene degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed 
and were used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify DNA products 
with 4577 bp in size. DNA sequence analysis revealed a 2568 bp open reading 
frame (ORF) encoding a 855 amino acid polypeptide homologous to herpesvirus UL5 
proteins. The DEV UL5 gene has a base composition of 769 adenine (29.95%), 556 
cytosine (21.65%), 533 guanine (20.76%) and 710 thymine (27.65%). Sequence 
comparison revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the DEV UL5 gene was highly 
similar to other alphaherpesviruses. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the 
fifteen herpesviruses viruses analyzed fell into four large groups, and the duck 
enteritis virus itself branched and was most closely related to meleagrid 
herpesvirus 1, gallid herpesvirus 2 and gallid herpesvirus 3 subtrees.

Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), first isolated in 1989, preferentially 
infects meat-type birds. However, layer flocks in China have experienced 
outbreaks of this virus since 2008. To understand the genetic diversity of ALV-J 
in Chinese layers, we compared and analyzed the GP85 gene sequences of 106 ALV-J 
isolates that were isolated between 1999 and 2010 in Mainland China. The GP85 
gene sequences of 41 layer isolates collected from 9 provinces of China between 
2008 and 2010 belonged to two separate, highly diverse subgroups and were 
differentiated from meat-type chicken isolates. When compared to all meat-type 
isolates from China, Subgroup 1 exclusively contained current layer isolates and 
seemed to be dominant; all the isolates in this subgroup exhibited gene 
diversity, and many unique amino acid mutations were present. In contrast, the 
viruses in Subgroup 2 were perfectly conserved and shared high identity with the 
prototype meat-type chicken ALV-J strain HPRS-103. The two subgroups contained 
only two concurrent mutations at the same position. Moreover, most of the 
isolates in Subgroup 1 had two additional glycosylation sites (at positions 101 
and 191) when compared with those in Subgroup 2. Our study provides evidence for 
the coexistence of two extremely different ALV-J subgroups in Chinese layers 
from 2008 to 2010, supporting the need for vaccine development and purification 
measures to prevent ALV-J infection in layers in China.

Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is one of the highly contagious viral disease, 
characterized by fever, sore mouth, conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and 
pneumonia, primarily affecting sheep and goats. Reports suggested variable host 
response in goats and sheep and this host response vis-a-vis the expression of 
microRNAs (miRNAs) has not been investigated. Here, miRNAs were sequenced and 
proteomics data were generated to identify the role of differentially expressed 
miRNA (DEmiRNA) in PPR virus (PPRV) infected lung and spleen tissues of sheep 
and goats. In lungs, 67 and 37 DEmiRNAs have been identified in goats and sheep, 
respectively. Similarly, in spleen, 50 and 56 DEmiRNAs were identified in goats 
and sheep, respectively. A total of 20 and 11 miRNAs were found to be common 
differentially expressed in both the species in PPRV infected spleen and lung, 
respectively. Six DEmiRNAs-miR-21-3p, miR-1246, miR-27a-5p, miR-760-3p, 
miR-320a, and miR-363 were selected based on their role in viral infections, 
apoptosis, and fold change. The target prediction analysis of these six selected 
DEmiRNAs from the proteome data generated, revealed involvement of more number 
of genes in lung and spleen of goats than in sheep. On gene ontology analysis of 
host target genes these DEmiRNAs were found to regulate several immune response 
signaling pathways. It was observed that the pathways viz. T cell receptor 
signaling, Rap1 signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, and B cell receptor 
signaling governed by DEmiRNAs were more perturbed in goats than in sheep. The 
data suggests that PPRV-induced miR-21-3p, miR-320a, and miR-363 might act 
cooperatively to enhance viral pathogenesis in the lung and spleen of sheep by 
downregulating several immune response genes. The study gives an important 
insight into the molecular pathogenesis of PPR by identifying that the 
PPRV-Izatnagar/94 isolate elicits a strong host response in goats than in sheep.

Genomic diversity and adaptation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium from analysis of six genomes of different phage types,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>
              <jats:italic>Salmonella enterica</jats:italic> serovar Typhimurium (or simply Typhimurium) is the most common serovar in both human infections and farm animals in Australia and many other countries. Typhimurium is a broad host range serovar but has also evolved into host-adapted variants (i.e. isolated from a particular host such as pigeons). Six Typhimurium strains of different phage types (defined by patterns of susceptibility to lysis by a set of bacteriophages) were analysed using Illumina high-throughput genome sequencing.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Variations between strains were mainly due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an average of 611 SNPs per strain, ranging from 391 SNPs to 922 SNPs. There were seven insertions/deletions (indels) involving whole or partial gene deletions, four inactivation events due to IS<jats:italic>200</jats:italic> insertion and 15 pseudogenes due to early termination. Four of these inactivated or deleted genes may be virulence related. Nine prophage or prophage remnants were identified in the six strains. Gifsy-1, Gifsy-2 and the <jats:italic>sopE2</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>sspH2</jats:italic> phage remnants were present in all six genomes while Fels-1, Fels-2, ST64B, ST104 and CP4-57 were variably present. Four strains carried the 90-kb plasmid pSLT which contains several known virulence genes. However, two strains were found to lack the plasmid. In addition, one strain had a novel plasmid similar to Typhi strain CT18 plasmid pHCM2.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The genome data suggest that variations between strains were mainly due to accumulation of SNPs, some of which resulted in gene inactivation. Unique genetic elements that were common between host-adapted phage types were not found. This study advanced our understanding on the evolution and adaptation of Typhimurium at genomic level.</jats:p>

Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with positive sense, 
single-stranded RNA genomes. The family Astroviridae contains two genera, 
Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, which – based upon our current knowledge – 
infect mammals and birds, respectively. However, recent seroprevalence study 
indicated that people with contact to turkeys can develop serological responses 
to the turkey astrovirus and minks might have been infected with the 
avastrovirus. These data suggest that the ""host species/astrovirus genus"" 
association should be permeable; however, mamastrovirus infection has not been 
reported from avian species, yet. In this study, a novel astrovirus was 
identified by viral metagenomics and RT-PCR methods in 2 (11%) out of 19 faecal 
samples collected from a wild, carnivorous bird species, European rollers 
(Coracias garrulus) from two breeding territories in Hungary. The complete 
genome sequence of astrovirus Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 (KP663426) was 7025 nt-long and 
had some unique genomic features including an unusually long spacer between the 
subgenomic RNA promoter and the ORF2 initiation codon. Using the BLASTp 
Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 had the highest aa identities 35%, 61% and 34% to MAstV 32 
(JF713710, host: porcine), to MAstV 23 (JF729316, host: rabbit) and to 
unclassified porcine astrovirus (JX684071) in ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2, 
respectively. The same proteins of Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 had 25%, 66% and 33% aa 
identities to the corresponding proteins of murine astrovirus (JX544743) as the 
closest strain. The sequence- and phylogenetic analysis indicated that 
Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 represents the first member of a novel mamastrovirus species. 
Data suggest that both mammals and birds could have been exposed to 
mamastroviruses and avastroviruses providing opportunities for cross-species 
infection and viral adaptation with cross-class astroviruses especially in 
carnivorous animals. Further investigation is needed to determine the origin, 
natural host species spectrum, distribution and spread of Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 
among vertebrates.

Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) are bisegmented viruses with a wide geographical and 
host species distribution. The number of novel PBV sequences has been increasing 
with the help of the viral metagenomics. A novel picobirnavirus strain, 
pbv/CHK/M3841/HUN/2011, was identified by viral metagenomics; the complete 
segment 1 (MH327933) and 2 (MH327934) sequences were obtained by RT-PCR from a 
cloacal sample of a diseased broiler breeder pullet in Hungary. Although the 
conserved nucleotide (e.g., ribosome binding site) and amino acid motifs (e.g., 
ExxRxNxxxE, S-domain of the viral capsid and motifs in the RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase) were identifiable in the chicken picobirnavirus genome, the putative 
segment 1 showed low (< 30%) amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding 
proteins of marmot and dromedary PBVs, while segment 2 showed higher (< 70%) 
amino acid sequence identity to a wolf PBV protein sequence. This is the first 
full-genome picobirnavirus sequence from a broiler breeder chicken, but the 
pathogenicity of this virus is still questionable.

An enteric outbreak with high mortality (34/52, 65.4%) was recorded in 2014 in 
home-reared estrildid finches (Estrildidae) in Hungary. A novel passerivirus was 
identified in a diseased violet-eared waxbill using viral metagenomics and 
confirmed by RT-(q)PCR. The complete genome of finch picornavirus strain 
waxbill/DB01/HUN/2014 (MF977321) showed the highest amino acid sequence identity 
of 38.9%, 61.6%, 69.6% in P1cap, 2Chel and 3CproDpol, respectively, to 
passerivirus A1 (GU182406). A high viral load (6.58 × 1010 genomic copies/ml) 
was measured in a cloacal specimen and in the tissues (spinal cord, lung, and 
the intestines) of two additional affected finches. In addition to intestinal 
symptoms (diarrhoea), the presence of extra-intestinal virus suggests a 
generalized infection in this fatal disease, for which the passerivirus might be 
a causative agent.

Intestinal samples collected from 43 commercial broiler and 33 commercial turkey 
flocks from all regions of the United States during 2005 and 2006 were examined 
for the presence of astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus, and coronavirus by reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and for the presence of groups 1 
and 2 adenovirus by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to further 
characterize the viruses and to evaluate species association and geographic 
patterns. Astroviruses were identified in samples from 86% of the chicken flocks 
and from 100% of the turkey flocks. Both chicken astrovirus and avian nephritis 
virus (ANV) were identified in chicken samples, and often both viruses were 
detected in the same flock. Turkey astrovirus type-2 and turkey astrovirus 
type-1 were found in 100% and 15.4% of the turkey flocks, respectively. In 
addition, 12.5% of turkey flocks were positive for ANV. Rotaviruses were present 
in 46.5% of the chicken flocks tested and in 69.7% of the turkey flocks tested. 
Based upon the rotavirus NSP4 gene sequence, the chicken and turkey origin 
rotaviruses assorted in a species-specific manner. The turkey origin rotaviruses 
also assorted based upon geographical location. Reoviruses were identified in 
62.8% and 45.5% of chicken and turkey flocks, respectively. Based on the 
reovirus S4 gene segment, the chicken and turkey origin viruses assorted 
separately, and they were distinct from all previously reported avian 
reoviruses. Coronaviruses were detected in the intestinal contents of chickens, 
but not turkeys. Adenoviruses were not detected in any chicken or turkeys 
flocks. Of the 76 total chicken and turkey flocks tested, only three chicken 
flocks were negative for all viruses targeted by this study. Most flocks were 
positive for two or more of the viruses, and overall no clear pattern of virus 
geographic distribution was evident. This study provides updated enteric virus 
prevalence data for the United States using molecular methods, and it reinforces 
that enteric viruses are widespread in poultry throughout the United States, 
although the clinical importance of most of these viruses remains unclear.

A longitudinal survey to detect enteric viruses in intestinal contents collected 
from turkeys in eight commercial operations and one research facility was 
performed using molecular detection methods. Intestinal contents were collected 
from turkeys prior to placement, with each flock resampled at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 
and 12 wk of age. The samples were screened for astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus, 
and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) by a reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR), and for groups 1 and 2 adenovirus by PCR. Rotavirus was the 
only virus detected prior to placement (7 of 16 samples examined). All of the 
commercial flocks were positive for rotavirus and astrovirus from 2 until 6 wk 
of age, and most were intermittently positive until 12 wk of age, when the birds 
were processed. Of the 96 samples collected from birds on the farms, 89.5% were 
positive for astrovirus, and 67.7% were positive for rotavirus. All flocks were 
negative for TCoV, reovirus, and group 1 adenovirus at all time points, and 
positive for group 2 adenovirus (hemorrhagic enteritis virus) at 6 wk of age. 
All the flocks monitored were considered healthy or normal by field personnel. 
Turkeys placed on research facilities that had been empty for months and 
thoroughly cleaned had higher body weights and lower feed conversion rates at 5 
wk of age when compared to turkeys placed on commercial farms. Intestinal 
samples collected at 1, 2, and 3 wk of age from these turkeys were free of 
enteric viruses. This report demonstrates that astroviruses and rotaviruses may 
be present within a turkey flock through the life of the flock. Comparison of 
infected birds with one group of turkeys that were negative for enteric viruses 
by the methods used here suggests that astrovirus and/or rotavirus may affect 
production. The full impact on flock performance needs to be further determined.

Avian astroviruses were detected by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain 
reaction in intestinal contents collected from commercial chickens and turkeys 
from throughout the United States from 2003 through 2005. Astroviruses were 
detected in birds from both healthy and poorly performing flocks with or without 
enteric disease. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with sequence data from the 
polymerase (ORF-1b) genes of 41 turkey-origin astroviruses and 23 chicken-origin 
astroviruses. All currently available avian astrovirus sequence data and 
selected mammalian astrovirus sequence data were included in the analysis. Four 
groups of avian astroviruses were observed by phylogenetic analysis: turkey 
astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1)-like viruses, turkey astrovirus type 2 
(TAstV-2)-like viruses, both detected in turkeys; avian nephritis virus 
(ANV)-like viruses, detected in both chickens and turkeys; and a novel group of 
chicken-origin astroviruses (CAstV). Among these four groups, amino acid 
identity was between 50.1% and 73.8%, and was a maximum of 49.4% for all avian 
isolates when compared with the mammalian astroviruses. There were multiple 
phylogenetic subgroups within the TAstV-2, ANV, and CAstV groups based on 9% 
nucleotide sequence divergence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed no clear 
assortment by geographic region or isolation date. Furthermore, no correlation 
was observed between the detection of a particular astrovirus and the presence 
of enteric disease or poor performance. Based on these data, a revision of the 
present taxonomic classification for avian astroviruses within the genus 
Avastrovirus is warranted.

The laboratory rotavirus strain, BRS/115, has been used for more than two 
decades to monitor rotaviruses in specific pathogen free flocks of laying hens. 
However, the virus strain has not been characterized in detail. Therefore we 
aimed at the description of molecular features of BRS115 by using random primed 
reverse transcription-PCR of the genomic RNA followed by massive parallel 
sequencing using the semiconductor sequencing technology. Over 64,000 trimmed 
reads mapped to reference sequences obtained from GenBank. The strain classified 
into the species Rotavirus A and genotyped G7-P[35]-I4-R4-C4-M4-A16-N4-T4-E11-H4 
according to guidelines of the Rotavirus Classification Working Group. 
Phylogenetic analysis identified shared features with chicken, turkey and pigeon 
origin rotaviruses. This study demonstrates the robustness of next generation 
sequencing in the characterization of reference virus materials used in 
specialized laboratories.

To trace the possible route of introduction of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 
(PEDV), the phylogenetic relationships of PEDV strains in the regions of 
epidemicity in the Philippines to PEDV strains that are endemic in other 
countries were investigated. Partial nucleotide sequences of the S1 spike gene 
was determined from the PEDV-positive samples and compared with S1 sequences 
from other countries. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PEDV strains in the 
Philippines segregate into two groups. Members of group 1 are related to strains 
from the USA, Taiwan, Japan and Canada, while those in group 2 are related to 
strains from China and Vietnam.

As the regional influenza reference centre operating within the Italian network 
InfluNet, here we report data on virological and epidemiological surveillance of 
influenza, as well as on the vaccination coverage rates achieved in Lombardy 
(Northern Italy) over 10 consecutive winter seasons (2004-2014).   Over the past 
10 years, influenza vaccine coverage declined both in the general population 
(from 15.7% in 2004-2005 to 11.7% in 2013-2014) and in the vaccine-target 
population of individuals ≥65-y-of-age (from 65.3% in 2004-2005 to 48.6% in 
2013-2014) and is far below the minimum planned threshold level (75%). The 
highest influenza-like illness (ILI) rates were recorded during the 2004-2005 
and 2009-2010 epidemics (peak incidence: 12.04‰ and 13.28‰, respectively). Both 
seasons were characterised by the introduction of novel viral strains: 
A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) (a drifted hemagglutinin variant) and 
A/California/7/2009(H1N1) pandemic virus (a swine origin quadruple reassortant), 
respectively. Because the antigenic match between vaccine and circulating 
strains was good in both of these seasons, a relevant proportion of cases may 
have been prevented by vaccination. A different situation was observed during 
the 2011-2012 season, when ILI morbidity rates in individuals ≥65-y-of-age were 
1.5-6-fold higher than those registered during the other epidemics under review. 
The higher morbidity resulted from the circulation during the 2011-2012 season 
of an A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like variant that presented a reduced genetic 
match with the A(H3N2) strain included in the 2011-2012 vaccine composition. The 
continuous surveillance of the characteristics of circulating viruses is an 
essential tool for monitoring their matching with seasonal vaccine strains. 
Strategies to increase coverage rates are warranted.

Sequence analyses of VP3 gene segments of Wongorr virus isolates from the 
Northern Territory of Australia were compared with the cognate gene segments 
from Picola and Paroo River viruses. Previous serological investigations had 
demonstrated some relationships between these viruses, however VP3 gene sequence 
and phylogenetic analyses placed these viruses within the same serogroup which 
was distinct from other described orbivirus serogroups. A polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) was developed for the detection of this serogroup and used to 
identify and determine partial sequence data for other isolates of the virus. 
Wongorr virus and the other tick and mosquito-borne orbiviruses (Kemerovo and 
Corriparta), were more closely related than the Culicoides transmitted 
orbiviruses, such as bluetongue (BTV) and African horse sickness virus (AHSV) 
which were shown to be on a separate branch of the orbivirus phylogenetic tree.

Development of cDNA probes for typing group A bovine rotaviruses on the basis of VP4 specificity,"<jats:p>Dot and Northern (RNA) blot hybridization assays were developed for the P typing of group A bovine rotaviruses (BRV) by using cDNA probes prepared from gene segment 4. The probes were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of hyperdivergent regions (nucleotides 211 to 686) of BRV strain UK, IND, NCDV, and Cr VP4 cDNA by using specific oligonucleotide primers. The probes were P type specific (VP4) and exhibited little or no cross-reactivity with double-stranded RNA from heterologous rotavirus P types. Our studies indicate that at least three P types, as defined by polymerase chain reaction-derived VP4 gene probes from the UK, NCDV, and Cr strains, exist among the seven BRV isolates tested.</jats:p>",0

OBJECTIVE: Chicken astroviruses have been known to cause severe disease in 
chickens leading to increased mortality and ""white chicks"" condition. Here we 
aim to characterize the causative agent of visceral gout suspected for 
astrovirus infection in broiler breeder chickens.
METHODS: Total RNA isolated from allantoic fluid of SPF embryo passaged with 
infected chicken sample was sequenced by whole genome shotgun sequencing using 
ion-torrent PGM platform. The sequence was analysed for the presence of coding 
and non-coding features, its similarity with reported isolates and epitope 
analysis of capsid structural protein.
RESULTS: The consensus length of 7513 bp genome sequence of Indian isolate of 
chicken astrovirus was obtained after assembly of 14,121 high quality reads. The 
genome was comprised of 13 bp 5'-UTR, three open reading frames (ORFs) including 
ORF1a encoding serine protease, ORF1b encoding RNA dependent RNA polymerase 
(RdRp) and ORF2 encoding capsid protein, and 298 bp of 3'-UTR which harboured 
two corona virus stem loop II like ""s2m"" motifs and a poly A stretch of 19 
nucleotides. The genetic analysis of CAstV/INDIA/ANAND/2016 suggested highest 
sequence similarity of 86.94% with the chicken astrovirus isolate CAstV/GA2011 
followed by 84.76% with CAstV/4175 and 74.48%% with CAstV/Poland/G059/2014 
isolates. The capsid structural protein of CAstV/INDIA/ANAND/2016 showed 84.67% 
similarity with chicken astrovirus isolate CAstV/GA2011, 81.06% with CAstV/4175 
and 41.18% with CAstV/Poland/G059/2014 isolates. However, the capsid protein 
sequence showed high degree of sequence identity at nucleotide level 
(98.64-99.32%) and at amino acids level (97.74-98.69%) with reported sequences 
of Indian isolates suggesting their common origin and limited sequence 
divergence. The epitope analysis by SVMTriP identified two unique epitopes in 
our isolate, seven shared epitopes among Indian isolates and two shared epitopes 
among all isolates except Poland isolate which carried all distinct epitopes.

This review concentrates on the epidemiology, latency and pathogenesis of, and 
the approaches taken to control infection of horses by equine herpesvirus types 
1 (EHV-1) and 4 (EHV-4). Although both viruses may cause febrile 
rhinopneumonitis, EHV-1 is the main cause of abortions, paresis and neonatal 
foal deaths. The lesion central to these three conditions is necrotising 
vasculitis and thrombosis resulting from lytic infection of endothelial cells 
lining blood capillaries. The initiation of infection in these lesions is likely 
to be by reactivated EHV-1 from latently infected leukocytes. However, host 
factors responsible for reactivation remain poorly understood. While vaccine 
development against these important viruses of equines involving classical and 
modern approaches has been ongoing for over five decades, progress, compared to 
other alpha herpesviruses of veterinary importance affecting cattle and pigs, 
has been slow. However recent data with a live temperature sensitive EHV-1 
vaccine show promise.

Twenty-three CSFV isolates recovered from field outbreaks in various parts of 
India during 2006-2009 were used for genetic analysis in the NS5B region (409 
nts). Seventeen of these were studied earlier [16] in the 5'UTR region. 
Phylogenetic analysis indicated the continued dominance of subgroup 1.1 strains 
in the country. Detailed analysis of a subgroup 2.2 virus indicated the 
plausible Chinese origin of this subgroup in India and provided indirect 
evidence of routes of CSFV movement within South East Asia region.

"Options for control of foot-and-mouth disease: knowledge, capability and policy","<jats:p>Foot-and-mouth disease can be controlled by zoo-sanitary measures and vaccination but this is difficult owing to the existence of multiple serotypes of the causative virus, multiple host species including wildlife and extreme contagiousness. Although intolerable to modern high-production livestock systems, the disease is not usually fatal and often not a priority for control in many developing countries, which remain reservoirs for viral dissemination. Phylogenetic analysis of the viruses circulating worldwide reveals seven principal reservoirs, each requiring a tailored regional control strategy. Considerable trade benefits accrue to countries that eradicate the disease but as well as requiring regional cooperation, achieving and maintaining this status using current tools takes a great deal of time, money and effort. Therefore, a progressive approach is needed that can provide interim benefits along the pathway to final eradication. Research is needed to understand and predict the patterns of viral persistence and emergence and to improve vaccine selection. Better diagnostic methods and especially better vaccines could significantly improve control in both the free and the affected parts of the world. In particular, vaccines with improved thermostability and a longer duration of immunity would facilitate control and make it less reliant on advanced veterinary infrastructures.</jats:p>",0

The sequence of 165 nucleotides at the 3' end of the 1D gene, determined from RT 
PCR amplified cDNA fragments, of 25 type O strains isolated from different 
parts/regions of India during 1987 1995 and the vaccine strain (R2/75) currently 
in use in India were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. One isolate from the 
neighbouring country Nepal was also included in the study. The virus/ field 
strains showed high degree of genetic heterogeneity among themselves with % 
divergence in nucleotide sequence ranging from 1.2 to 19.4%. The Indian strains 
were much away (13.3 20.6%) from the exotic type O strains of O1BFS, O1K, and 
O1Campos. The type O strains analyzed were classified into three genotypes 
basing on level of divergence observed in nucleotide sequence. The type O 
vaccine virus (R2/75) was > 71% divergent (7.3-15.2%) from the field strains 
which revealed significant ( > 5%) genetic heterogeneity between the two. The 
phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct lineages, viz., (i) lineage 1 
represented by the exotic strains, (ii) lineage 2 represented by 25 of the field 
strains which clustered into seven subgroups/sublines (2a-2g), and (iii) lineage 
3 represented by a unique field isolate which shared the branching/origin with 
the vaccine strain. The lineage 2 which comprised of 25 of the 26 type O field 
strains analyzed, was placed almost at equidistance from the lineages 1 and 3 in 
the phylogenetic tree. The vaccine strain was closer to the viruses in lineage 
2. Though there was no specific distribution pattern of sequences in different 
geographical regions of India, the viruses/ sequences in subgroup 2f appeared to 
be restricted to the southern states. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequence 
in the immunodominant regions 133-160 and 200-208 of the 1D gene product (VP1) 
showed that the two viruses in lineage 3 had unique amino acid residues at the 
positions 138 (D), 139 (G), 144 (I), and 158 (A) compared to rest of the strains 
including the exotic ones. Comparison of amino acid residues at critical 
positions 144, 148, 149, 151, 153, 154, and 208 revealed similarity between the 
type O strains analyzed. The virus strains showed variation (V/L/I) at position 
144. One field strain showed replacement from Q149-->E and another from 
P208-->L. Thus, the study revealed that the type O FMD virus populations 
circulating in India and causing disease outbreaks are genetically much 
heterogeneous but related at the immunodominant region of VP1 polypeptide, and 
there are more than one genetically distinct virus populations in almost every 
region of the country which is possible due to unrestricted animal movement in 
the country. The involvement of vaccine virus in disease outbreaks was ruled out 
as the field strains (excluding the one in lineage 3) were phylogenetically 
distinct from it.

"Isolation of a bovine rotavirus with a ""super-short"" RNA electrophoretic pattern from a calf with diarrhea","<jats:p>A rotavirus with a ""super-short"" RNA electropherotype was isolated from a calf with diarrhea and was designated VMRI strain. Segments 10 and 11 of this rotavirus migrated more slowly than did those of bovine rotavirus strains NCDV, B641, and B223. The electrophoretic pattern of the VMRI strain was similar to that reported for rotaviruses with super-short RNA electropherotypes from humans and rabbits. Northern (RNA) blot hybridization indicated that gene 11 of the VMRI strain was altered and migrated between gene segments 9 and 10. The subgroup of the VMRI strain was shown to be subgroup I. The VMRI strain of bovine rotavirus was neutralized by antisera containing polyclonal antibodies to rotavirus serotype 6 (bovine rotavirus serotype I) strains NCDV and B641 and by ascitic fluid containing monoclonal antibodies directed to VP7 of serotype 6 rotavirus. The VMRI strain was not neutralized by either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to strain B223 (bovine rotavirus serotype II). Collective data on the neutralization of the VMRI strain with monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies suggest that this virus is a member of the NCDV group (serotype 6) of rotaviruses (bovine rotavirus serotype I).</jats:p>",0

Vesicular stomatitis (VS) viruses have been classified into two serotypes: New 
Jersey (VSNJV) and Indiana (VSIV). Here, we have characterized field isolates 
causing vesicular stomatitis in Brazil and Argentina over a 35-year span. 
Cluster analysis based on either serological relatedness, as inferred from virus 
neutralization and complement fixation assays, or nucleotide sequences of two 
separate genes (phosphoprotein or glycoprotein) grouped the field isolates into 
two distinct monophyletic groups within the Indiana serogroup. One group 
included seven viruses from Brazil and Argentina that were serologically 
classified as Indiana-2 and Cocal virus (COCV). The other group contained three 
viruses from Brazil that were serologically classified as Indiana-3 and the 
prototype of this group, Alagoas virus (VSAV). Interestingly, two 
vesiculoviruses that were isolated from insects but do not cause disease in 
animals, one from Brazil (Maraba virus; MARAV) and the other from Colombia (CoAr 
171638), grouped into two separate genetic lineages within the Indiana serotype. 
Our data provide support for the classification of viruses causing clinical VS 
in livestock in Brazil and Argentina into two distinct groups: Indiana-2 
(VSIV-2) and Indiana-3 (VSIV-3). We suggest using nomenclature for these viruses 
that includes the serotype, year and place of occurrence, and affected host. 
This nomenclature is consistent with that currently utilized to describe field 
isolates of VSNJV or VSIV in scientific literature.

Viral recombination blurs taxonomic lines: examination of single-stranded DNA viruses in a wastewater treatment plant,"<jats:p>Understanding the structure and dynamics of microbial communities, especially those of economic concern, is of paramount importance to maintaining healthy and efficient microbial communities at agricultural sites and large industrial cultures, including bioprocessors. Wastewater treatment plants are large bioprocessors which receive water from multiple sources, becoming reservoirs for the collection of many viral families that infect a broad range of hosts. To examine this complex collection of viruses, full-length genomes of circular ssDNA viruses were isolated from a wastewater treatment facility using a combination of sucrose-gradient size selection and rolling-circle amplification and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Single-stranded DNA viruses are among the least understood groups of microbial pathogens due to genomic biases and culturing difficulties, particularly compared to the larger, more often studied dsDNA viruses. However, the group contains several notable well-studied examples, including agricultural pathogens which infect both livestock and crops (<jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Geminiviridae</jats:italic>), and model organisms for genetics and evolution studies (<jats:italic>Microviridae</jats:italic>). Examination of the collected viral DNA provided evidence for 83 unique genotypic groupings, which were genetically dissimilar to known viral types and exhibited broad diversity within the community. Furthermore, although these genomes express similarities to known viral families, such as<jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Geminiviridae</jats:italic>, and<jats:italic>Microviridae</jats:italic>, many are so divergent that they may represent new taxonomic groups. This study demonstrated the efficacy of the protocol for separating bacteria and large viruses from the sought after ssDNA viruses and the ability to use this protocol to obtain an in-depth analysis of the diversity within this group.</jats:p>",0

Infection with Bovine Viral Diarrhea Viruses (BVDV) in cattle results in a wide 
range of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild respiratory disease to fetal 
death and mucosal disease, depending on the virulence of the virus and the 
immune and reproductive status of the host. In this study 30 Argentinean BVDV 
isolates were characterized by phylogenetic analysis. The isolates were 
genotyped based on comparison of the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and the E2 
gene. In both phylogenetic trees, 76% of the viruses were assigned to BVDV 1b, 
whereas BVDV 1a, 2a and 2b were also found. Eight of the BVDV 1b isolates were 
further characterized by cross-neutralization tests using guinea pig antisera 
and sera from bovines vaccinated with two different commercial vaccines. The 
results demonstrated the presence of a marked antigenic diversity among 
Argentinean BVDV isolates and suggest the need to incorporate BVDV 1b isolates 
in diagnostic strategies.

Phylogenetic Relationships among Virulent Newcastle Disease Virus Isolates from the 2002-2003 Outbreak in California and Other Recent Outbreaks in North America,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Isolates from the 2002-2003 virulent Newcastle disease virus (v-NDV) outbreak in southern California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas in the United States were compared to each other along with recent v-NDV isolates from Mexico and Central America and reference avian paramyxovirus type 1 strains. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were conducted on a 1,195-base genomic segment composing the 3′ region of the matrix (M) protein gene and a 5′ portion of the fusion (F) protein gene including the M-F intergenic region. This encompasses coding sequences for the nuclear localization signal of the M protein and the F protein cleavage activation site. A dibasic amino acid motif was present at the predicted F protein cleavage activation site in all v-NDVs, including the California 2002-2003, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Mexico, and Central America isolates. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the California 2002-2003, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas viruses were most closely related to isolates from Mexico and Central America. An isolate from Texas obtained during 2003 appeared to represent a separate introduction of v-NDV into the United States, as this virus was even more closely related to the Mexico 2000 isolates than the California, Arizona, and Nevada viruses. The close phylogenetic relationship between the recent 2002-2003 U.S. v-NDV isolates and those viruses from countries geographically close to the United States warrants continued surveillance of commercial and noncommercial poultry for early detection of highly virulent NDV.</jats:p>",0

Several picornaviruses (Picornaviridae) are currently attracting interest 
without the need of being ""emergent"". The Parechovirus genus, validated 40 years 
after the discovery of the first two members (""echoviruses 22 and 23"") includes 
neurotropic viruses whose molecular diagnosis demonstrated the involvement in 
infant meningitis and newborn sepsis, in particular type 3. Improvements in 
multiplex molecular diagnosis of respiratory infections - thanks to the 
Influenza AH1N1pdm2009 pandemy - showed that rhinoviruses may be involved in 
severe forms. The risk of the re-emergence of poliomyelitis in Europe, after an 
11-year period of elimination, is a serious threat, owing to the circulation of 
the wild-type poliovirus in the Middle East and Africa because of conflicts, 
population displacements and poverty. The current widespread epidemics of 
hand-foot-mouth disease and/or meningitis infections due to enterovirus 71, with 
fatal encephalitis and cardio-pulmonary failure, are clear evidence of its 
emergence in South-East Asia. Although uncommon in Europe and less frequently 
incriminated than coxsackieviruses A6 and A10 in hand-foot-mouth disease, EV71 
represents a real risk for the future. Extensive genotyping of the enteroviruses 
by the Enterovirus Surveillance Network should ward off these two potential 
risks of emergence/reemergence.

Cocirculation of Avian H9N2 and Contemporary “Human” H3N2 Influenza A Viruses in Pigs in Southeastern China: Potential for Genetic Reassortment?,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Pigs are permissive to both human and avian influenza viruses and have been proposed to be an intermediate host for the genesis of pandemic influenza viruses through reassortment or adaptation of avian viruses. Prospective virological surveillance carried out between March 1998 and June 2000 in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China, on pigs imported from southeastern China, provides the first evidence of interspecies transmission of avian H9N2 viruses to pigs and documents their cocirculation with contemporary human H3N2 (A/Sydney/5/97-like, Sydney97-like) viruses. All gene segments of the porcine H9N2 viruses were closely related to viruses similar to chicken/Beijing/1/94 (H9N2), duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 (H9N2), and the descendants of the latter virus lineage. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that repeated interspecies transmission events had occurred from the avian host to pigs. The Sydney97-like (H3N2) viruses isolated from pigs were related closely to contemporary human H3N2 viruses in all gene segments and had not undergone genetic reassortment. Cocirculation of avian H9N2 and human H3N2 viruses in pigs provides an opportunity for genetic reassortment leading to the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential.</jats:p>",0

In February 2013, H7N9 (A/H7N9/2013_China), a novel avian influenza virus, broke 
out in eastern China and caused human death. It is a global priority to discover 
its origin and the point in time at which it will become transmittable between 
humans. We present here an interdisciplinary method to track the origin of H7N9 
virus in China and to establish an evolutionary dynamics model for its 
human-to-human transmission via mutations. After comparing influenza viruses 
from China since 1983, we established an A/H7N9/2013_China virus evolutionary 
phylogenetic tree and found that the human instances of virus infection were of 
avian origin and clustered into an independent line. Comparing hemagglutinin 
(HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences of A/H7N9/2013_China viruses with all 
human-to-human, avian, and swine influenza viruses in China in the past 30 
years, we found that A/H7N9/2013_China viruses originated from Baer's Pochard 
H7N1 virus of Hu Nan Province 2010 (HA gene, EPI: 370846, similarity with H7N9 
is 95.5%) and duck influenza viruses of Nanchang city 2000 (NA gene, EPI: 
387555, similarity with H7N9 is 97%) through genetic re-assortment. HA and NA 
gene sequence comparison indicated that A/H7N9/2013_China virus was not similar 
to human-to-human transmittable influenza viruses. To simulate the evolution 
dynamics required for human-to-human transmission mutations of H7N9 virus, we 
employed the Markov model. The result of this calculation indicated that the 
virus would acquire properties for human-to-human transmission in 11.3 years 
(95% confidence interval (CI): 11.2-11.3, HA gene).

Orf virus (ORFV) is the etiological agent of contagious ecthyma (CE), a pustular 
dermatitis of sheep and goats. Outbreaks of ORFV have been observed in all 
geographical regions of the world, including Argentina. The origin and identity 
of Argentinian ORFVs are unknown, and no comparative or phylogenetic studies of 
these viruses have been performed. In this study, we described the sequencing 
and analysis of five ORFV molecular markers: a partial B2L gene (ORF011), VIR 
(ORF020), an envelope mature protein (ORF109), vIL10 (ORF127), and GIF (ORF117) 
from two particular Argentinian outbreaks of CE.

Avian influenza (AI) viruses have been sporadically isolated in South America. 
The most recent reports are from an outbreak in commercial poultry in Chile in 
2002 and its putative ancestor from a wild bird in Bolivia in 2001. Extensive 
surveillance in wild birds was carried out in Argentina during 2006-2007. Using 
RRT-PCR, 12 AI positive detections were made from cloacal swabs. One of those 
positive samples yielded an AI virus isolated from a wild kelp gull (Larus 
dominicanus) captured in the South Atlantic coastline of Argentina. Further 
characterization by nucleotide sequencing reveals that it belongs to the H13N9 
subtype. Phylogenetic analysis of the 8 viral genes suggests that the 6 internal 
genes are related to the isolates from Chile and Bolivia. The analysis also 
indicates that a cluster of phylogenetically related AI viruses from South 
America may have evolved independently, with minimal gene exchange, from 
influenza viruses in other latitudes. The data produced from our investigations 
are valuable contributions to the study of AI viruses in South America.

The emergence of the pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza virus poses a potential global 
threat for human and animal health. In this study, we carried out pandemic 
H1N1/2009 influenza virus surveillance in swine herds in Cuba intending to 
determine whether the virus was circulating among pig populations. As a result 
we describe, for the first time, the detection of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza 
virus in swine herds in Cuba. In addition, phylogenetic analysis and molecular 
characterization of three viral isolates were performed. Phylogenetic 
relationships confirmed that all of the eight genes of the three isolates were 
derived from the pandemic H1N1/2009 virus. The Cuban isolates, formed an 
independent cluster within the pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza strains. Different 
molecular markers, previously described in pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza viruses, 
related with adaptive evolution, viral evasion from the host-immune response, 
virulence and dissemination were also present in Cuban pandemic H1N1/2009 
isolates.

Currently, the infection with the hepatitis E virus represents the most frequent 
cause for acute hepatitis and jaundice in the world. According to WHO 
estimations, around two billion people, representing one third of the world's 
population, live in endemic areas for HEV and, therefore, are at risk of 
infection. In developed countries, the circulation of the virus in both human 
and animal (swine, boar, deer) sewage has been confirmed; however, the incidence 
rate is low compared to that of developing countries where outbreaks of acute 
hepatitis transmitted via the fecal-oral route are originated, more frequently 
in the flooding season or after natural disasters, combined with deficient 
sanitary conditions. There are currently 4 known genotypes of HEV. Genotypes 1 
and 2 are isolated in all human epidemic outbreaks in developing countries, 
while genotypes 3 and 4 are isolated not only in humans but also in animals, in 
both developing and industrialized countries. These data support genotypes 3 and 
4 having zoonotic nature. The diagnosis of this disease is based in the 
detection of anti-HEV IgG and IgM in blood serum using enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent methods. However, the method that best confirms the diagnosis is 
the RT-PCR, which detects HEV RNA in blood serum and also provides the genotype. 
The clinical course is generally that of an acute hepatitis which in some cases 
may require hospitalization and that, in transplant patients or HIV infected 
individuals can become a chronic hepatitis. Furthermore, the virus constitutes 
an important risk for pregnant women. The hepatitis E can present a wide range 
of symptoms, from a subclinical case to chronic liver disease with extrahepatic 
manifestations. For this reason, the diagnostic is challenging if no 
differential diagnosis is included. There is no specific antiviral drug for 
hepatitis E, but satisfactory results have been observed in some patients 
treated with pegylated interferon alfa2a and/or ribavirin. This revision is an 
update of all the molecular, epidemiological, clinic and preventive knowledge on 
this emergent disease up to date.

Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A viruses (AIV) have caused outbreaks 
among domestic poultry and wild aquatic birds in many Asian, European, and 
African countries since 1997. In March 2006 an avian H5N1 influenza A virus was 
isolated from poultry in Israel. In the present study we molecularly 
characterized the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of eleven H5N1 
viruses isolated from domestic poultry in Israel and Gaza in March-April 2006. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA genes showed that the Israeli and Gazian 
viruses were closely related to viruses isolated in Egypt in 2006.

The first two isolates of H9N2 influenza virus in Israel were collected from 
turkey and chicken hosts in May 2000. The actual epizootic of the H9N2 virus 
started in December 2001, after a 1.5-year period of silence, and still 
continues. A total of more than 500 isolations from turkeys and chickens were 
registered during the outbreaks. The present study has revealed some genetic 
peculiarities among the local isolates, namely: all the isolates belong to the 
same G1-like phylogenetic lineage, within which they form a single group, which, 
in turn, is divided into three subgroups in the cases of the HA and NP genes, 
and two subgroups in the case of the NA gene. The results present a basis for 
suggesting the existence of two parallel evolutionary trends originating from 
the same local ""prototype"" isolate.

In 2002-2003, velogenic Newcastle Disease Virus outbreaks, closely related to 
the Mexican isolates, were confirmed in the United States (U.S.) in southern 
California, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. In this report, virulent NDVs isolated 
in Mexico between 1998 and 2006 were subjected to biologic characterization, 
using standard pathogenicity tests, and to phylogenetic analysis. Chicken embryo 
mean death time (MDT) test results ranged from 39.7 to 61.5 hours, and 
intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values were between 1.59 and 1.94, 
compared to a possible maximum value of 2.0. These isolates showed a dibasic 
amino acid motif at the fusion protein cleavage site sequence required for host 
systemic replication. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Mexican virulent 
NDVs belong to the class II, genotype V viruses and can be clearly divided in 
two groups as follows: isolates from 1998 to 2001 with close epidemiologic 
relationship with the latest U.S. NDV outbreaks, and phylogenetically distinct 
viruses, isolated from 2004 to 2006, which showed higher virulence. The 
assessment of the evolution of viruses from Mexico and other neighboring 
countries will aid in the U.S surveillance efforts for early detection of highly 
virulent NDV.

Responsiveness of T cells (RTC) was studied in BALB/c mice intramuscularly 
infected with various lyssaviruses. After infection by this peripheral route, 
two types of viruses could be classified according to their effects: 1) 
pathogenic viruses, including fixed rabies Pasteur virus (serogenotype 1) and 
wild viruses belonging to serogenotype 1 (from a rabid fox in France and from a 
cow infected by a vampire bat in Brazil) or to serogenotype 5 (European bat 
lyssavirus 1); and 2) non-pathogenic viruses, including Mokola virus 
(serogenotype 3). RTC was tested by analysing in vitro the capacity of splenic T 
cells from infected BALB/c mice to produce cytokines after antigenic (purified 
lyssavirus antigens) or polyclonal stimulation (concanavalin A). Cytokine 
production was followed by assaying the biological activity of interleukin-2 and 
by testing for interleukin-2, interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma (IL2, IL4 and 
IFN gamma ) messenger RNAs (mRNA) by transcription into complementary DNA and 
amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. The initial biologically active 
IL2 and cytokine mRNA production was observed in mice infected with pathogenic 
or non-pathogenic lyssaviruses. Only mice with symptoms (infected with 
pathogenic viruses) lost the capacity to produce cytokines in vitro after 
antigen-specific stimulation. No such loss was observed after polyclonal 
stimulation. In mice peripherally infected with non-pathogenic viruses, no loss 
was observed after stimulation with lyssavirus antigens. Thus, infection with 
pathogenic lyssaviruses by the peripheral route induces in BALB/c mice a loss of 
T-cell responsiveness after antigen activation, but not after polyclonal 
activation.

Conserved presence of G-quadruplex forming sequences in the Long Terminal Repeat Promoter of Lentiviruses,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>G-quadruplexes (G4s) are secondary structures of nucleic acids that epigenetically regulate cellular processes. In the human immunodeficiency lentivirus 1 (HIV-1), dynamic G4s are located in the unique viral LTR promoter. Folding of HIV-1 LTR G4s inhibits viral transcription; stabilization by G4 ligands intensifies this effect. Cellular proteins modulate viral transcription by inducing/unfolding LTR G4s. We here expanded our investigation on the presence of LTR G4s to all lentiviruses. G4s in the 5′-LTR U3 region were completely conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a cattle-infecting lentivirus. All other non-primate lentiviruses displayed hints of less stable G4s. In primate lentiviruses, the possibility to fold into G4s was highly conserved among strains. LTR G4 sequences were very similar among phylogenetically related primate viruses, while they increasingly differed in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation between primate lentivirus LTR G4s and Sp1/NFκB binding sites was found. All LTR G4s folded: their complexity was assessed by polymerase stop assay. Our data support a role of the lentiviruses 5′-LTR G4 region as control centre of viral transcription, where folding/unfolding of G4s and multiple recruitment of factors based on both sequence and structure may take place.</jats:p>",0
Comparison and contrast of genes and biological pathways responding to Marek’s disease virus infection using allele-specific expression and differential expression in broiler and layer chickens,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>

            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Marek’s disease (MD) is a commercially important neoplastic disease of chickens caused by the Marek’s disease virus (MDV), a naturally occurring oncogenic alphaherpesvirus. Enhancing MD genetic resistance is desirable to augment current vaccines and other MD control measures. High throughput sequencing was used to profile splenic transcriptomes from individual F<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> progeny infected with MDV at 4 days of age from both outbred broilers (meat-type) and inbred layer (egg-type) chicken lines that differed in MD genetic resistance. The resulting information was used to identify SNPs, genes, and biological pathways exhibiting allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection in each type of chicken. In addition, we compared and contrasted the results of pathway analyses (ASE and differential expression (DE)) between chicken types to help inform on the biological response to MDV infection.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>With 7 individuals per line and treatment group providing high power, we identified 6,132 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4,768 genes and 4,528 SNPs in 3,718 genes in broilers and layers, respectively, that exhibited ASE in response to MDV infection. Furthermore, 548 and 434 genes in broilers and layers, respectively, were found to show DE following MDV infection. Comparing the datasets, only 72 SNPs and 850 genes for ASE and 20 genes for DE were common between the two bird types. Although the chicken types used in this study were genetically different, at the pathway level, both TLR receptor and JAK/STAT signaling pathways were enriched as well as exhibiting a high proportion of ASE genes, especially at the beginning of both above mentioned regulatory pathways.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>RNA sequencing with adequate biological replicates is a powerful approach to identify high confidence SNPs, genes, and pathways that are associated with transcriptional response to MDV infection. In addition, the SNPs exhibiting ASE in response to MDV infection provide a strong foundation for determining the extent to which variation in expression influences MD incidence plus yield genetic markers for genomic selection. However, given the paucity of overlap among ASE SNP sets (broilers vs. layers), it is likely that separate screens need to be incorporated for each population. Finally, comparison of gene lists obtained between these two diverse chicken types indicate the TLR and JAK/STAT signaling are conserved when responding to MDV infection and may be altered by selection of genes exhibiting ASE found at the start of each pathway.</jats:p>

This study describes the genetic characterization of serotype A viruses 
collected during outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) that occurred in 
Algeria in 2017. These are the first reports of clinical cases due to this 
serotype in the country since 1977. One complete genomic sequence (comprising 
8,119 nucleotides) and three additional near-complete genomic sequences were 
generated. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that these viruses were classified 
within the A/AFRICA/G-IV lineage, most closely related to viruses circulating in 
Nigeria between 2009 and 2015. These unexpected results motivate further studies 
to define the precise pathways by which this viral lineage has been introduced 
into North Africa in order to understand risks of future disease incursions into 
the region.

Hepatitis C virus is considered a major public health problem, infecting 2%-3% 
of the human population. Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic 
liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most frequent indication 
for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available. Hepatitis C virus 
displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, 
although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, 
there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to 
hepatitis C virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in 
humans and resulted in the current pandemic. In fact, due to this restricted 
host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, 
hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control and 
prophylactic vaccine development. Recently, several studies discovered new 
viruses related to hepatitis C virus, belonging to the hepaci- and pegivirus 
genera, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domesticated animals which 
live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses). Genetic and biological 
characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses 
infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins 
of hepatitis C virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and 
immune responses using tractable animal models. In this review article, we start 
with an introduction on the genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus and then 
focus on the newly discovered viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus. 
Finally, we discuss possible theories about the origin of this important viral 
human pathogen.

In June 2013, a 4-year-old Welsh Mountain ewe and in March 2014 a 10-day-old 
lamb of the same breed and the same flock presented progressive neurological 
signs including depressed sensorium, tremor, and unusual behaviour. 
Neuropathological examination of the brain and spinal cord detected 
non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis and dorsal root ganglionitis, 
characteristic of a neurotropic viral agent in both sheep. Metagenomic analysis 
of different tissue samples from both animals identified a novel Ovine 
Astrovirus (OvAstV). The presence of viral genome in the central nervous system 
was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Although the cases presented nine months apart, the 
identified OvAstV shared nearly identical sequences, differing in only three 
nucleotide positions across the complete genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
a close relation of OvAstV to neurotropic bovine astroviruses and an enteric 
OvAstV. In conclusion, these are the first reported cases of astrovirus 
infection in domestic sheep that were associated with encephalitis and 
ganglionitis.

Viral metagenomics of feces collected from 58 Peruvian children with unexplained 
diarrhea revealed several small circular ssDNA genomes. Two genomes related to 
sequences previously reported in feces from chimpanzees and other mammals and 
recently named smacoviruses were characterized and then detected by PCR in 1.7 % 
(1/58) and 19 % (11/58) of diarrheal samples, respectively. Another three 
genomes from a distinct small circular ssDNA viral group provisionally called 
pecoviruses encoded Cap and Rep proteins with <35 % identity to those in related 
genomes reported in human, seal, porcine and dromedary feces. Pecovirus DNA was 
detected in 15.5 % (9/58), 5.9 % (3/51) and 3 % (3/100) of fecal samples from 
unexplained diarrhea in Peru, Nicaragua and Chile, respectively. Feces 
containing these ssDNA genomes also contained known human enteric viral 
pathogens. The cellular origins of these circular ssDNA viruses, whether human 
cells, ingested plants, animals or fungal foods, or residents of the gut 
microbiome, are currently unknown.

A novel gyrovirus genome found in the feces of an adult with diarrhea is 
described. The genome shows the three expected main ORFs encoding a structural 
protein (VP1), nonstructural protein (VP2), and Apoptin protein (VP3), which 
shared identities of 41, 42, and 38 % with those of the most closely related 
gyrovirus proteins, respectively. Given the high divergence in its genome, this 
gyrovirus may be considered the prototype for a new viral species (GyV9) in the 
Gyrovirus genus. Because the closest relatives of this gyrovirus infect chicken, 
a possible dietary origin for the presence of this virus in human feces is 
discussed.

BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus 2 causes different clinical syndromes resulting 
in a significant economic loss in the pork industry. Three pigs with unexplained 
cardiac and multi-organ inflammation that tested negative for PCV2 and other 
known porcine pathogens were further analyzed.
METHODS: Histology was used to identify microscopic lesions in multiple tissues. 
Metagenomics was used to detect viral sequences in tissue homogenates. In situ 
hybridization was used to detect viral RNA expression in cardiac tissue.
RESULTS: In all three cases we characterized the genome of a new circovirus we 
called PCV3 with a replicase and capsid proteins showing 55 and 35 % identities 
to the genetically-closest proteins from a bat-feces associated circovirus and 
were even more distant to those of porcine circovirus 1 and 2. Common 
microscopic lesions included non-suppurative myocarditis and/or cardiac 
arteriolitis. Viral mRNA was detected intralesionally in cardiac cells. Deep 
sequencing in tissues also revealed the presence of porcine astrovirus 4 in all 
three animals as well as rotavirus A, porcine cytomegalovirus and porcine 
hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus in individual cases.
CONCLUSION: The pathogenicity and molecular epidemiology of this new circovirus, 
alone or in the context of co-infections, warrants further investigations.

We describe the nearly complete genome of a highly divergent parvovirus, we 
tentatively name Sesavirus, from the feces of a California sea lion pup 
(Zalophus californianus) suffering from malnutrition and pneumonia. The 
5,049-base-long genome contained two major ORFs encoding a 553-aa nonstructural 
protein and a 965-aa structural protein which shared closest amino acid 
identities of 25 and 28 %, respectively, with members of the copiparvovirus 
genus known to infect pigs and cows. Given the low degree of similarity, 
Sesavirus might be considered as prototype for a new genus with a proposed name 
of Marinoparvovirus in the subfamily Parvovirinae.

A third gyrovirus species in human faeces,"<jats:p>Until 2011 the genus <jats:italic>Gyrovirus</jats:italic> in the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic> consisted of a single virus (Chicken anemia virus or CAV) causing a common immunosuppressive disease in chickens when a second gyrovirus (HGyV) was reported on the skin of 4 % of healthy humans. HGyV is very closely related to a recently described chicken gyrovirus, AGV2, suggesting that they belong to the same viral species. During a viral metagenomic analysis of 100 human faeces from children with diarrhoea in Chile we identified multiple known human pathogens (adenoviruses, enteroviruses, astroviruses, sapoviruses, noroviruses, parechoviruses and rotaviruses) and a novel gyrovirus species we named GyV3 sharing &lt;63 % similarity with other gyrovirus proteins with evidence of recombination with CAV in its UTR. <jats:italic>Gyroviridae</jats:italic> consensus PCR revealed a high prevalence of CAV DNA in diarrhoea and normal faeces from Chilean children and faeces of USA cats and dogs, which may reflect consumption of CAV-infected/vaccinated chickens.

BACKGROUND: A significant fraction of cases of diarrhea, a leading cause of 
childhood mortality worldwide, remain unexplained.
OBJECTIVES: To identify viruses in unexplained cases of diarrhea using an 
unbiased metagenomics approach.
STUDY DESIGN: Viral nucleic acids were enriched from the feces from 48 cases of 
unexplained diarrhea from Burkina Faso, sequenced, and compared against all 
known viral genomes.
RESULTS: The full genome of a highly divergent astrovirus was sequenced in a 
sample co-infected with parechovirus 1. RT-PCR identified a single astrovirus 
infection in these 48 patients indicating a low prevalence. Human 
astrovirus-BF34 was most closely related to mamastrovirus species 8 and 9 also 
found in human with which it shared 62%, 74%, and 57% amino acid identities over 
its protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase and capsid proteins, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Burkina Faso astrovirus is proposed as prototype for a novel 
species in the genus Mamastrovirus, here tentatively called Mamastrovirus 20, 
representing the fifth human astrovirus species.

Acute Diarrhea in West African Children: Diverse Enteric Viruses and a Novel Parvovirus Genus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Parvoviruses cause a variety of mild to severe symptoms or asymptomatic infections in humans and animals. During a viral metagenomic analysis of feces from children with acute diarrhea in Burkina Faso, we identified in decreasing prevalence nucleic acids from anelloviruses, dependoviruses, sapoviruses, enteroviruses, bocaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses, parechoviruses, rotaviruses, cosavirus, astroviruses, and hepatitis B virus. Sequences from a highly divergent parvovirus, provisionally called bufavirus, were also detected whose NS1 and VP1 proteins showed &lt;39% and &lt;31% identities to those of previously known parvoviruses. Four percent of the fecal samples were PCR positive for this new parvovirus, including a related bufavirus species showing only 72% identity in VP1. The high degree of genetic divergence of these related genomes from those of other parvoviruses indicates the presence of a proposed new
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Parvoviridae</jats:named-content>
            genus containing at least two species. Studies of the tropism and pathogenicity of these novel parvoviruses will be facilitated by the availability of their genome sequences.

Birds are frequent sources of emerging human infectious diseases. Viral 
particles were enriched from the feces of 51 wild urban pigeons (Columba livia) 
from Hong Kong and Hungary, their nucleic acids randomly amplified and then 
sequenced. We identified sequences from known and novel species from the viral 
families Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Reoviridae, Adenovirus, 
Astroviridae, and Caliciviridae (listed in decreasing number of reads), as well 
as plant and insect viruses likely originating from consumed food. The near full 
genome of a new species of a proposed parvovirus genus provisionally called 
Aviparvovirus contained an unusually long middle ORF showing weak similarity to 
an ORF of unknown function from a fowl adenovirus. Picornaviruses found in both 
Asia and Europe that are distantly related to the turkey megrivirus and 
contained a highly divergent 2A1 region were named mesiviruses. All eleven 
segments of a novel rotavirus subgroup related to a chicken rotavirus in group G 
were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. This study provides an initial 
assessment of the enteric virome in the droppings of pigeons, a feral urban 
species with frequent human contact.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of a novel circovirus of canaries and its relationship to other members of the genus Circovirus of the family Circoviridae,"<jats:p>The circular, single-stranded DNA genome of a novel circovirus of canaries, tentatively named canary circovirus (CaCV), was cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis indicated that the genome was 1952 nucleotides (nt) in size and had the potential to encode three viral proteins, including the putative capsid and replication-associated (Rep) proteins. The CaCV genome shared greatest sequence similarity (58·3% nt identity) with the newly characterized columbid circovirus (CoCV) and was more distantly related to the two porcine circovirus strains, PCV1 and PCV2, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) and a recently isolated goose circovirus (GCV) isolate (46·8–50·9% nt identity). In common with other members of the <jats:italic>Circovirus</jats:italic> genus, several nt structures and amino acid motifs thought to be implicated in virus replication were identified on the putative viral strand. Phylogenetic analysis of both the capsid and Rep protein-coding regions provided further evidence that CaCV is more closely related to CoCV and BFDV and more distantly related to GCV, PCV1 and PCV2.</jats:p>",0

Wild bird fecal samples collected and characterized by the USDA as part of a 
national surveillance effort were sequenced to study the genetic relatedness of 
avian, swine, and human H1 and N1 subtypes. Our results find that the 2009 H1N1 
human outbreak is closely related to swine virus, but falls into different 
clades in the H1 and N1 trees. Further, there is evidence of multiple viral 
genetic exchanges between birds and swine. Ongoing research across host species 
contributes to an understanding of the circulation of influenza viruses.

Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute and highly contagious respiratory 
disease of chickens caused by an alphaherpesvirus, infectious laryngotracheitis 
virus (ILTV). Recently, full genome sequences of wild-type and vaccine strains 
have been determined worldwide, but none was from Europe. The aim of this study 
was to determine and analyse the complete genome sequences of five ILTV strains. 
Sequences were also compared to reveal the similarity of strains across time and 
to discriminate between wild-type and vaccine strains. Genomes of three ILTV 
field isolates from outbreaks occurred in Italy in 1980, 2007 and 2011, and two 
commercial chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines were sequenced using the 454 
Life Sciences technology. The comparison with the Serva genome showed that 35 
open reading frames (ORFs) differed across the five genomes. Overall, 54 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 27 amino acid differences in 19 ORFs and two 
insertions in the UL52 and ORFC genes were identified. Similarity among the 
field strains and between the field and the vaccine strains ranged from 99.96% 
to 99.99%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship among them, as 
well. This study generated data on genomic variation among Italian ILTV strains 
revealing that, even though the genetic variability of the genome is well 
conserved across time and between wild-type and vaccine strains, some mutations 
may help in differentiating among them and may be involved in ILTV 
virulence/attenuation. The results of this study can contribute to the 
understanding of the molecular bases of ILTV pathogenicity and provide genetic 
markers to differentiate between wild-type and vaccine strains.

Species A rotaviruses are highly diverse and impose a substantial burden to 
human and animal health. Interspecies transmission between livestock, domestic 
animals and humans is commonly observed, but spread of animal-like rotaviruses 
within the human population is limited. During the continued monitoring of 
rotavirus strains in Germany, an unusual G6P[9] rotavirus strain was detected in 
feces of a child. The complete rotavirus coding sequences revealed a unique 
G6-P[9]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T3-E2-H3 genotype constellation. The virus was 
phylogenetically related to feline G3P[9] strains and other human G6P[9] 
rotaviruses of presumable zoonotic origin. Analysis of primer binding sites of 
G6 specific genotyping revealed further evidence of a G6P[9] feline reservoir. 
Moreover, substantial deficits of conventional semi-nested PCR genotyping 
approaches in detecting contemporary G6P[9] were revealed. Rotavirus strain 
GER29-14 most likely resulted from a direct or recent interspecies transmission 
from a cat to human. Further studies could assess nucleic acid sequences and 
genotype constellations of feline rotavirus to confirm the likely feline origin 
of sporadic human G6P[9] strains.

Low-pathogenic avian influenza virus A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) is the progenitor of highly pathogenic A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9),"<jats:p>The first confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus infections in North America was caused by A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9); however, the phylogeny of this virus is largely unknown. This study performed genomic sequence analysis of 11 avian influenza isolates from 1956 to 1979 for comparison with A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9). Phylogenetic and genetic analyses included these viruses in combination with all known full-genome sequences of avian viruses isolated before 1981. It was shown that a low-pathogenic avian influenza virus, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1), that had been isolated 3 months previously, was the closest known genetic relative with six genome segments of common lineage encoding the polymerase subunits PB2, PB1 and PA, nucleoprotein (NP), haemagglutinin (HA) and non-structural (NS) proteins. The lineages of these genome segments included reassortment with other North American turkey viruses that were all rooted in North American wild waterfowl with the HA gene originating from the H5N2 serotype. The phylogenies demonstrated adaptation from North American wild birds to turkeys with the possible involvement of domestic waterfowl. The turkey isolate, A/turkey/Wisconsin/1968 (H5N9), was the second most closely related poultry isolate to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9), possessing five common lineage genome segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA and neuraminidase). The A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) virus was more virulent than A/turkey/Wisconsin/68 (H5N9) for chicken embryos and mice, indicating a greater biological similarity to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9). Thus, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) was identified as the closest known ancestral relative of HPAI A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9), which will serve as a useful reference virus for characterizing the early genetic and biological properties associated with the emergence of pathogenic avian influenza strains.</jats:p>",0

Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a new technology that was 
recently commercialized to enable the precise quantification of target nucleic 
acids in a sample. ddPCR measures absolute quantities by counting nucleic acid 
molecules encapsulated in discrete, volumetrically defined, water-in-oil droplet 
partitions. This novel ddPCR format offers a simple workflow capable of 
generating highly stable partitioning of DNA molecules. In this study, we 
assessed key performance parameters of the ddPCR system. A linear ddPCR response 
to DNA concentration was obtained from 0.16% through to 99.6% saturation in a 
20,000 droplet assay corresponding to more than 4 orders of magnitude of target 
DNA copy number per ddPCR. Analysis of simplex and duplex assays targeting two 
distinct loci in the Lambda DNA genome using the ddPCR platform agreed, within 
their expanded uncertainties, with values obtained using a lower density 
microfluidic chamber based digital PCR (cdPCR). A relative expanded uncertainty 
under 5% was achieved for copy number concentration using ddPCR. This level of 
uncertainty is much lower than values typically observed for quantification of 
specific DNA target sequences using currently commercially available real-time 
and digital cdPCR technologies.

As a member of the European Virus Archive (EVA) consortium, our laboratory is 
developing and maintaining a large collection of viruses. This collection 
implies the use of a panel of cell lines originating from various animal 
species. In order to make easier the handling of such a large panel of cell 
lines, wide spectrum real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays were developed to allow the 
detection and the quantification of DNA and mRNA of β-actin, one of the most 
commonly used eukaryotic housekeeping genes. By using two degenerated primers 
and a unique probe, these two assays were shown to detect nucleic acids of a 
panel of vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines commonly used in animal 
virology. This panel included human, monkey, rodent, dog, pig, fish, batrachian, 
mosquito and tick cell lines. Additionally, the two assays amplified 
successfully β-actin-encoding sequences of sandflies. Sensitivity evaluation 
performed on synthetic DNA and RNA sequences showed that the two assays were 
very sensitive and suitable for accurate quantification. The two assays 
constitute together a convenient method suitable for multiple purposes. They can 
be used for instance to estimate the amount of contaminating cellular genetic 
material prior to sequence-independent amplification of viral genomes achieved 
before high-throughput sequencing, to evaluate the efficiency of DNase and/or 
RNase treatments performed on cellular extract and to check nucleic acid 
extraction by using β-actin-encoding sequences as endogenous control. This assay 
will constitute a precious tool for virologists working with multiple cell lines 
or animal models.

Outbreaks of a previously unrecorded disease have recently affected Pyrenean 
chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica) populations across the mountain range. A 
pestivirus was hypothesized to be the cause of this emerging disease and this 
type of virus can cross the species barrier and be transmitted to or from 
wildlife. Using an epidemiological survey conducted from 1995 to 2004 at Orlu, 
France, we characterized the virus and analyzed its transmission. A phylogenetic 
analysis of viral sequences and virus neutralization tests showed that the virus 
belonged to the newly described border disease virus-4 group. The increase of 
seroprevalence with age indicated that infection can occur at any age and 
resulted in lifelong immunity. Overall, 70.3% of 323 samples were positive for 
anti-p80 antibodies and 10.2% of 167 samples showed viremia, as demonstrated by 
either positive ELISA antigen test or RT-PCR. Infection has thus been widespread 
in this population since 1995, whereas no mass mortality or clinical signs have 
been observed. Incidence and seroprevalence varied seasonally and according to 
number of individuals aged less than 2 years old in the population, so viral 
transmission was dependent on host population age structure. We propose that the 
virus is now endemic in this population and is likely detrimental for 
reproduction and juveniles. Further investigation is needed to estimate the 
impact of pestivirus on host population dynamics and the risk of 
cross-transmission to farm animals.

Influenza A Viruses Detected in Swine in Southern Germany after the H1N1 Pandemic in 2009,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Infections with influenza A viruses (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content>) are highly prevalent in swine populations, and stable cocirculation of at least three lineages has been well documented in European swine – till 2009. However, since the emergence of the human pandemic pdmH1N1 virus in 2009, which has been (re)introduced into individual swine herds worldwide, the situation has been changing. These variations in the respective <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> pools within pig populations are of major interest, and the zoonotic potential of putative emerging viruses needs to be evaluated. As data on recent <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> in swine from southern Germany were relatively sparse, the purpose of this study was to determine the major <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> subtypes actually present in this region. To this aim, from 2010 to 2013, 1417 nasal swabs or lung tissue samples from pigs with respiratory disease were screened for <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> genomes. Overall, in 130 holdings <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> genomes were detected by real‐time <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">RT</jats:styled-content>‐<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PCR</jats:styled-content> targeting the matrix protein gene. For further analyses, several <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PCR</jats:styled-content> protocols were adapted to quickly subtype between H1, pdmH1, H3, N1 and N2 sequences. Taken together, cocirculation of the three stable European lineages of <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> was confirmed for Bavaria. H1N1 sequences were identified in 59, whereas H1N2 genomes were only diagnosed in 14, and H3N2 in 9 of the holdings analysed. However, pdmH1 in combination with N1 was detected in 2010, 2012 and 2013 confirming a presence, albeit in low prevalence, likewise pdmH1N2 reassortant viruses. Interestingly, individual cases of coinfections with more than one subtype were diagnosed. Partial genome sequences were determined and phylogenetic analyses performed. Clearly other than in the human population classically circulating <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> have not been displaced by pdmH1N1 in Bavarian swine. However, some interesting viruses were detected. Further surveillance of these viruses in the Bavarian pig population will be of major importance, to monitor future developments.</jats:p>",0
High turnover drives prolonged persistence of influenza in managed pig herds,"<jats:p>Pigs have long been hypothesized to play a central role in the emergence of novel human influenza A virus (IAV) strains, by serving as mixing vessels for mammalian and avian variants. However, the key issue of viral persistence in swine populations at different scales is ill understood. We address this gap using epidemiological models calibrated against seroprevalence data from Dutch finishing pigs to estimate the ‘critical herd size’ (CHS) for IAV persistence. We then examine the viral phylogenetic evidence for persistence by comparing human and swine IAV. Models suggest a CHS of approximately 3000 pigs above which influenza was likely to persist, i.e. orders of magnitude lower than persistence thresholds for IAV and other acute viruses in humans. At national and regional scales, we found much stronger empirical signatures of prolonged persistence of IAV in swine compared with human populations. These striking levels of persistence in small populations are driven by the high recruitment rate of susceptible piglets, and have significant implications for management of swine and for overall patterns of genetic diversity of IAV.</jats:p>",0
Viral shedders in a herd vaccinated against infection with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) without prior testing for the presence of persistently infected animals,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Introduction: Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), caused by the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), is one of the most important diseases of cattle worldwide. The purpose of the study was to determine the BVDV infection status in a dairy herd vaccinated against BVD. Before vaccination started in 2008, there had been no prior identification or the removal of the possible source of infection (persistently infected animals). It was expected that vaccination itself would enable the elimination of viral shedders on a long term basis. Material and Methods: Serological screening for antibodies against BVDV with determination for antibodies titres, BVDV antigen, and the presence of the viral genome with phylogenetic analysis of positive samples in the herd were performed, despite the lack of any clinical problems indicating possible presence of BVDV infection. Results: 19 individuals persistently infected with BVDV were identified among calves and heifers but not in adult cattle. All virus shedders were antibody negative and the genotype of isolated virus was BVDV-1b, indicating a single source of infection. The vaccine used in the herd was composed of BVDV-1a strain. In each of the tested cowsheds, antibody titres against BVDV-1b were higher than against BVDV-1a (median values). Conclusion: Despite a long-lasting vaccination programme and relatively high sequence homology of vaccinal and field strains of BVDV (83.6%), it was not possible to avoid transplacental infections of foetuses and the birth of persistently infected calves from vaccinated heifers although the protection against clinical disease was accomplished.</jats:p>",0
Describing the Silent Human Virome with an Emphasis on Giant Viruses,"<jats:p>Viruses are the most abundant obligate intracellular entities in our body. Until recently, they were only considered to be pathogens that caused a broad array of pathologies, ranging from mild disease to deaths in the most severe cases. However, recent advances in unbiased mass sequencing techniques as well as increasing epidemiological evidence have indicated that the human body is home to diverse viral species under non-pathological conditions. Despite these studies, the description of the presumably healthy viral flora, i.e. the normal human virome, is still in its infancy regarding viral composition and dynamics. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the human virome under non-pathological conditions.</jats:p>",0

In industrialized countries, Hepatitis E is a recognized zoonosis, with wild 
boar and swine representing the main reservoirs for zoonotic genotype HEV-3 in 
Europe. Data related to HEV infection in wild boar population in Romania are 
restricted to serological surveys. Therefore, our main goal was to determine the 
HEV prevalence in wild boar population and to characterize HEV strains 
circulating in Romania. Using TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay, we analyzed the 
presence of RNA HEV in 45 liver samples and five spleen samples collected from 
50 wild boars. Samples were collected during the 2013-2015 hunting seasons. Nine 
samples of 50 were tested positive for HEV RNA, resulting an overall prevalence 
of 18%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates clustered in different 
HEV-3 monophyletic groups, depending on the sampling county. This is the first 
study signalling, based on molecular analysis, the presence of HEV in wild boar 
population from Romania. Also, in this study, we report the detection of HEV in 
splenic tissue from wild boar.

BACKGROUND: Avian influenza virus (AIV) is classified into two pathotypes, low 
pathogenic (LP) and high pathogenic (HP), based on virulence in 
chickens.Differences in pathogenicity between HPAIV and LPAIV might eventually 
be related to specific characteristics of strains, tissue tropism and host 
responses.
METHODS: To study differences in disease development between HPAIV and LPAIV, we 
examined the first appearance and eventual load of viral RNA in multiple organs 
as well as host responses in brain and intestine of chickens infected with two 
closely related H7N1 HPAIV or LPAIV strains.
RESULTS: Both H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV spread systemically in chickens after a 
combined intranasal/intratracheal inoculation. In brain, large differences in 
viral RNA load and host gene expression were found between H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV 
infected chickens. Chicken embryo brain cell culture studies revealed that both 
HPAIV and LPAIV could infect cultivated embryonic brain cells, but in accordance 
with the absence of the necessary proteases, replication of LPAIV was limited. 
Furthermore, TUNEL assay indicated apoptosis in brain of HPAIV infected chickens 
only. In intestine, where endoproteases that cleave HA of LPAIV are available, 
we found minimal differences in the amount of viral RNA and a large overlap in 
the transcriptional responses between HPAIV and LPAIV infected chickens. 
Interestingly, brain and ileum differed clearly in the cellular pathways that 
were regulated upon an AI infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Although both H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV RNA was detected in a broad 
range of tissues beyond the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, our 
observations indicate that differences in pathogenicity and mortality between 
HPAIV and LPAIV could originate from differences in virus replication and the 
resulting host responses in vital organs like the brain.

Identification and classification of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) on the 
basis of nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis have become an 
important tool to study the epidemiology and to control CSF disease. According 
to phylogenetic analyses of short sequences from the 5'nontranslated region (150 
nt) and the E2 (190 nt), most CSFV isolates from South and Central America have 
been assorted to the subgenotypes 1.1 and 1.3, while CSFV isolates from Cuba 
have been allocated to subgenotype 1.2. Here we demonstrate that determination 
and comparison of full-length E2 sequences as well as of the sequences encoding 
for N(pro), C, E(rns), E1 and E2 (3361 nt) do not support segregation of Cuban 
CSFV isolates to subgenotype 1.2. In fact, our analysis revealed that the Cuban 
isolates are more divergent from other so far known CSFV subgenotype 1 isolates 
and form a novel separate subgenotype that is proposed to be designated 
subgenotype 1.4.

University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.

BACKGROUND: Human infections with highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses 
have generally been confirmed by molecular amplification or culture-based 
methods. Serologic surveillance has potential advantages which have not been 
realized because rapid and specific serologic tests to detect H5N1 infection are 
not widely available.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe an epitope-blocking ELISA to 
detect specific antibodies to H5N1 viruses in human or animal sera. The assay 
relies on a novel monoclonal antibody (5F8) that binds to an epitope comprising 
amino acid residues 274-281 (CNTKCQTP) in the HA1 region of H5 hemagglutinin. 
Database search analysis of publicly available sequences revealed that this 
epitope is conserved in 100% of the 163 H5N1 viruses isolated from humans. The 
sensitivity and specificity of the epitope-blocking ELISA for H5N1 were 
evaluated using chicken antisera to multiple virus clades and other influenza 
subtypes as well as serum samples from individuals naturally infected with H5N1 
or seasonal influenza viruses. The epitope-blocking ELISA results were compared 
to those of hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and microneutralization assays. 
Antibodies to H5N1 were readily detected in immunized animals or convalescent 
human sera by the epitope-blocking ELISA whereas specimens with antibodies to 
other influenza subtypes yielded negative results. The assay showed higher 
sensitivity and specificity as compared to HI and microneutralization.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The epitope-blocking ELISA based on a unique 5F8 mAb 
provided highly sensitive and 100% specific detection of antibodies to H5N1 
influenza viruses in human sera.

New Hepatitis B Virus of Cranes That Has an Unexpected Broad Host Range,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>All hepadnaviruses known so far have a very limited host range, restricted to their natural hosts and a few closely related species. This is thought to be due mainly to sequence divergence in the large envelope protein and species-specific differences in host components essential for virus propagation. Here we report an infection of cranes with a novel hepadnavirus, designated CHBV, that has an unexpectedly broad host range and is only distantly evolutionarily related to avihepadnaviruses of related hosts. Direct DNA sequencing of amplified CHBV DNA as well a sequencing of cloned viral genomes revealed that CHBV is most closely related to, although distinct from, Ross' goose hepatitis B virus (RGHBV) and slightly less closely related to duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). Phylogenetically, cranes are very distant from geese and ducks and are most closely related to herons and storks. Naturally occurring hepadnaviruses in the last two species are highly divergent in sequence from RGHBV and DHBV and do not infect ducks or do so only marginally. In contrast, CHBV from crane sera and recombinant CHBV produced from LMH cells infected primary duck hepatocytes almost as efficiently as DHBV did. This is the first report of a rather broad host range of an avihepadnavirus. Our data imply either usage of similar or identical entry pathways and receptors by DHBV and CHBV, unusual host and virus adaptation mechanisms, or divergent evolution of the host genomes and cellular components required for virus propagation.</jats:p>",0

A nested polymerase chain reaction was used to identify 13 pestivirus strains 
isolated from small ruminants in several mixed (sheep and goats) flocks of 
Southern Italy, and for classification as bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) 
type 1, BVDV type 2, and Border disease virus (BDV) genotypes. Of the nine ovine 
isolates, two were characterized as BVDV type 1, and seven as BVDV type 2. The 
four pestiviruses isolated from kids belong to BVDV type 1. None of the 
pestivirus strains tested could be classified as 'true' BDV (genotype 3). 
Although BVDV type 2 has been described in Europe rarely, the characterization 
of BD/90-1M strain as BVDV type 2, isolated in Italy in 1990, demonstrates that 
this genotype has been circulating in Italy since the 1990s.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute or chronic hepatitis in humans and can be 
transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Pigs are one of the main reservoirs for 
this infection. Sixty pigs, 4-5 months of age, on a swine herd in Japan had 
detectable anti-HEV IgG antibodies, and five (8.3%) of them had ongoing 
infection of genotype 3 HEV. Five HEV strains obtained from the viremic pigs 
shared 98.8-100% nucleotide identity, and one representative strain 
(swHE1606845), whose entire genomic sequence was determined in this study, 
differed by 14.1-19.6% from the reported HEV strains of subtypes 3a-3k and by 
14.7-19.1% from other genotype 3 HEV strains whose subtypes have not yet been 
assigned. swHE1606845 showed a higher nucleotide p-distance value of ≥0.143 with 
the genotype 3 HEV strains of subtypes 3a-3k and ≥0.152 with other genotype 3 
strains of unassigned subtypes. A SimPlot analysis revealed a lack of 
recombination events. These results indicate that swHE1606845 is a candidate 
member of a novel subtype of genotype 3. Further efforts to identify the 
swHE1606845-like novel strain are warranted to clarify the origin of this strain 
and to determine the complete nucleotide sequences of two additional 
swHE1606845-like strains for assigning a new subtype.

The new variants of the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produce a range 
of symptoms and cause global economic losses to the poultry industry. We 
investigated the S1 glycoprotein of 24 recent IBV isolates from chickens and 
demonstrated that two predominant genetic groups were circulating in southern 
Thailand between 2008 and 2013. Seven IBV variants, isolated from 2008 to 2009, 
were clustered in the Thailand THA001 group I while 15 IBV variants, isolated 
from 2009 to 2013, were classified into the QX-like group II. Moreover, a single 
isolate from a broiler was categorized into the Massachusetts-type, and an 
isolate from a layer belonged to the 4/91 type virus. Interestingly, both the 
IBV groups I and II were isolated from native chickens (62.5%) and caused a 
range of symptoms. Our results indicate that the QX-like viruses were 
predominant after 2009, replacing the THA001 type viruses. Furthermore, native 
chickens may contribute to the epidemiology of IB.

BACKGROUND: Qinghai Lake in central China has been at the center of debate on 
whether wild birds play a role in circulation of highly pathogenic avian 
influenza virus H5N1. In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic at Qinghai Lake killed 
more than 6000 migratory birds including over 3000 bar-headed geese (Anser 
indicus). H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa, and in following years 
has re-emerged in wild birds along the Central Asia flyway several times.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To better understand the potential involvement 
of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we studied the movements of bar-headed 
geese marked with GPS satellite transmitters at Qinghai Lake in relation to 
virus outbreaks and disease risk factors. We discovered a previously 
undocumented migratory pathway between Qinghai Lake and the Lhasa Valley of 
Tibet where 93% of the 29 marked geese overwintered. From 2003-2009, sixteen 
outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 
and the majority were located within the migratory pathway of the geese. Spatial 
and temporal concordance between goose movements and three potential H5N1 virus 
sources (poultry farms, a captive bar-headed goose facility, and H5N1 outbreak 
locations) indicated ample opportunities existed for virus spillover and 
infection of migratory geese on the wintering grounds. Their potential as a 
vector of H5N1 was supported by rapid migration movements of some geese and 
genetic relatedness of H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Qinghai Lake.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to compare phylogenetics of 
the virus with spatial ecology of its host, and the combined results suggest 
that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region. However, the 
strength of the evidence would be improved with additional sequences from both 
poultry and wild birds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where H5N1 has a clear 
stronghold.

The aim of the present study was to characterize the virus from the lesions and 
histopathology of organs associated with mortality in Kuroiler (dual purpose 
variety of poultry developed and marketed by Keggfarms Pvt. Ltd, India) birds 
suspected of Marek's disease. Among 1047 birds from two farms of different 
location with 5.5 and 34% mortality, two types of lesion were observed in post 
mortem examination; tumors in vital organs-liver, spleen, kidney, lung and 
ovaries and generalized small nodular tumour in the abdominal cavity. Molecular 
characterization based on detection of ICP4 gene showed the presence of Marek's 
disease virus (MDV) from tissues and cell culture adapted isolates in Madin 
Darby Canine Kidney cell lines. Histopathological examination revealed 
multinucleated immature lymphoid cells infiltration in the organs. Phylogenetic 
analysis of the isolates based on meq gene showed the isolates belongs to 
cluster I genotype of MDV. This is for the first time the MDV virus is 
characterized from an outbreak in the poultry flock in farmer's field affecting 
production in Meghalaya state of North east India.

The ecology and age structure of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus outbreak in wild mute swans,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The first UK epizootic of highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 influenza in wild birds occurred in 2008, in a population of mute swans that had been the subject of ornithological study for decades. Here we use an innovative combination of ornithological, phylogenetic and immunological approaches to investigate the ecology and age structure of HP H5N1 in nature. We screened samples from swans and waterbirds using PCR and sequenced HP H5N1-positive samples. The outbreak's origin was investigated by linking bird count data with a molecular clock analysis of sampled virus sequences. We used ringing records to reconstruct the age-structure of outbreak mortality, and we estimated the age distribution of prior exposure to avian influenza. Outbreak mortality was low and all HP H5N1-positive mute swans in the affected population were &lt;3 years old. Only the youngest age classes contained an appreciable number of individuals with no detectable antibody responses to viral nucleoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the outbreak strain circulated locally for ∼1 month before detection and arrived when the immigration rate of migrant waterbirds was highest. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that HP H5N1 epizootics in wild swans exhibit limited mortality due to immune protection arising from previous exposure. Our study population may represent a valuable resource for investigating the natural ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus can infect a 
variety of animals and continually poses a threat to animal and human health. 
While many genotypes of H5N1 virus can be found in chicken, few are associated 
with the infection of mammals. Characterization of the genotypes of viral 
strains in animal populations is important to understand the distribution of 
different viral strains in various hosts. This also facilitates the surveillance 
and detection of possible emergence of highly pathogenic strains of specific 
genotypes from unknown hosts or hosts that have not been previously reported to 
carry these genotypes.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two H5N1 isolates were obtained from lung 
samples of two raccoon dogs that had died from respiratory disease in China. 
Pathogenicity experiments showed that the isolates were highly pathogenic to 
chicken. To characterize the genotypes of these viruses, their genomic sequences 
were determined and analyzed. The genetic contents of these isolates are 
virtually identical and they may come from the same progenitor virus. 
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolates were genetically closely 
related to genotype V H5N1 virus, which was first isolated in China in 2003, and 
were distinct from the dominant virus genotypes (e.g. genotype Z) of recent 
years. The isolates also contain a multibasic amino acid motif at their HA 
cleavage sites and have an E residue at position 627 of the PB2 protein similar 
to the previously-identified avian viruses.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report that genotype V H5N1 virus is 
found to be associated with a mammalian host. Our results strongly suggest that 
genotype V H5N1 virus has the ability to cross species barriers to infect 
mammalian animals. These findings further highlight the risk that avian 
influenza H5N1 virus poses to mammals and humans, which may be infected by 
specific genotypes that are not known to infect these hosts.

Three influenza H1N1 viruses were isolated in 2005 from pigs with respiratory 
disease on a farm in eastern China. The three isolates were characterized to 
determine their probable origin. Each of the eight genes of the isolates was 
most closely related to the corresponding gene from the classical swine H1N1 
virus. Also, phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that each of the eight 
genes of the isolates was closely related to the classical swine H1N1 viruses, 
especially those isolated in China. The HA1 proteins of the three isolates were 
identical to that of A/Swine/Guangdong/ 1/01, a virus isolated in 2001 in China, 
even though three nucleotide differences were observed. These results further 
support the concept that swine can serve as a reservoir of genetically stable 
influenza viruses.

Identification of Genes Critical for Resistance to Infection by West Nile Virus Using RNA-Seq Analysis,"<jats:p>The West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging infection of biodefense concern and there are no available treatments or vaccines. Here we used a high-throughput method based on a novel gene expression analysis, RNA-Seq, to give a global picture of differential gene expression by primary human macrophages of 10 healthy donors infected in vitro with WNV. From a total of 28 million reads per sample, we identified 1,514 transcripts that were differentially expressed after infection. Both predicted and novel gene changes were detected, as were gene isoforms, and while many of the genes were expressed by all donors, some were unique. Knock-down of genes not previously known to be associated with WNV resistance identified their critical role in control of viral infection. Our study distinguishes both common gene pathways as well as novel cellular responses. Such analyses will be valuable for translational studies of susceptible and resistant individuals—and for targeting therapeutics—in multiple biological settings.</jats:p>",0

Two swine paramyxoviruses (SPMV)-(81-19252 (Texas-81) and 92-7783 (ISU-92)-were 
isolated from encephalitic pigs in the United States in 1981 and 1992. 
Antigenic, morphologic, and biological characteristics of these two viruses were 
essentially similar to members of the family Paramyxoviridae. Antigenic analysis 
by indirect fluorescent antibody, immunoblot, and one-way cross-neutralization 
tests placed these viruses along with bovine parainfluenza 3 (BPIV3) viruses. 
Purified virions were 50-300 nm in size and morphologically indistinguishable 
from other paramyxoviruses. These two viruses hemagglutinated red blood cells 
and had neuraminidase activity. The gene junctions of fusion (F) and 
hemagglutinin (HN) glycoprotein genes of these viruses contained highly 
conserved transcription start and stop signal sequences and trinucleotide 
intergenic regions similar to other Paramyxoviridae. The F gene of ISU-92 was 
longer than Texas-81 due to insertion of a 24-nucleotide ""U""-rich 3' 
untranslated region. Structure-based sequence alignment of glycoproteins of 
these two SPMVs indicated that they are essentially similar in structure and 
function to parainfluenzaviruses. The Texas-81 strain was closely related to 
BPIV3 Shipping Fever (SF) strain at nucleotide and amino acid level, while the 
ISU-92 strain was more closely related to BPIV3 910N strain. The envelope 
glycoproteins of ISU-92 had only approximately 92 and approximately 96% identity 
at nucleotide and amino acid levels with BPIV3-SF strain, respectively. The high 
sequence identities to BPIV3 indicated cross-species infection in pigs. 
Phylogenetic analyses based on both F protein and HN protein suggested the 
classification of these viruses into the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, genus 
Respirovirus, and genotype A of BPIV3.

"Viral communities associated with porcine respiratory disease complex in intensive commercial farms in Sichuan province, China","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), a common piglet disease, causes substantive economic losses in pig farming. To investigate the viral diversity associated with PRDC, the viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 PRDC-affected piglets were investigated using metagenomics. By deep sequencing and <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> assembly, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but most viruses comprised small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque teno sus virus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC.

Bluetongue (BT) is one of the most important insect-borne, non-contagious viral 
diseases of ruminants and can cause severe disease and death in sheep. Its 
pathogen, bluetongue virus (BTV) has a double-stranded RNA genome consisting of 
10 segments that provides an opportunity for field and vaccine strains of 
different serotypes to reassort whilst simultaneously infecting the same animal. 
For the first time, we report the full-length genome sequence of a BTV strain of 
serotype 21 (5149E) isolated from sentinel cattle in Guangxi Province in China 
in 2015. Sequence analysis suggested that the isolate 5149E had undergone a 
reassortment incident and acquired seg-6 from an isolate of BTV-16 which 
originated from Japan. This study aims to provide more understanding as to the 
origin and epidemiology of BTV.

A tick-borne segmented RNA virus contains genome segments derived from unsegmented viral ancestors,"<jats:title>Significance</jats:title><jats:p>RNA viruses can contain a single (unsegmented) or multiple (segmented) genomic molecules. However, the evolutionary connection between these two fundamentally different forms of genome organization is unclear. We discovered a previously unidentified segmented RNA virus of ticks that, uniquely, contained two segments derived from an unsegmented flavivirus, as well as two highly divergent segments of unknown origin. In addition, copies of this virus were present in a nematode (dog roundworm). Collectively, these results demonstrate the remarkable diversity of viral genome structures as well as a previously unidentified evolutionary link between unsegmented and segmented viruses.</jats:p>",0

Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an avian oncogenic retrovirus that 
induces myeloid tumors and hemangiomas in chickens and causes severe economic 
losses with commercial layer chickens and meat-type chickens. High-throughput 
sequencing followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and 
bioinformatics analyses were performed to advance the understanding of 
regulatory networks associated with differentially expressed non-coding RNAs and 
mRNAs that facilitate ALV-J infection. We examined the expression of mRNAs, long 
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and miRNAs in the spleens of 20-week-old chickens 
infected with ALV-J and uninfected chickens. We found that 1723 mRNAs, 7,883 
lncRNAs and 13 miRNAs in the spleen were differentially expressed between the 
uninfected and infected groups (P < 0.05). Transcriptome analysis showed that, 
compared to mRNA, chicken lncRNAs shared relatively fewer exon numbers and 
shorter transcripts. Through competing endogenous RNA and co-expression network 
analyses, we identified several tumor-associated or immune-related genes and 
lncRNAs. Along transcripts whose expression levels significantly decreased in 
both ALV-J infected spleen and tumor tissues, BCL11B showed the greatest change. 
These results suggest that BCL11B may be mechanistically involved in 
tumorigenesis in chicken and neoplastic diseases, may be related to immune 
response, and potentially be novel biomarker for ALV-J infection. Our results 
provide new insight into the pathology of ALV-J infection and high-quality 
transcriptome resource for in-depth study of epigenetic influences on disease 
resistance and immune system.

Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an avian oncogenic retrovirus that 
has led to severe economic losses in the poultry industry in China in recent 
decades. Here, using high throughput transcriptome sequencing of HD11 and CEF 
cells infected with ALV-J, a set of 4804 novel long non-coding transcripts and 
numerous differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were 
identified. We also found that they share relatively shorter transcripts and 
fewer exon numbers compared to mRNA. Correlation analysis suggested that many 
lncRNAs may activate gene expression in an enhancer-like manner other than 
through transcriptional regulation. Expression level analyses in vivo showed 
that three lncRNAs (NONGGAT001975.2, NONGGAT005832.2 and NONGGAT009792.2) may be 
associated with immune response regulation and could function as novel 
biomarkers for ALV-J infection. Our findings provides new insight into the 
pathological process of ALV-J infection and should serve as a high-quality 
resource for further research on epigenetic influences on disease-resistance 
breeding as well as immune system and genomic studies.

Virome (viral megagenomics) detection using next generation sequencing has been 
widely applied in virology, but its methods remain complicated and need 
optimization. In this study, we detected the viromes of RNA viruses of one mock 
sample, one pooled duck feces sample and one pooled mink feces sample on the 
Personal Genome Machine platform using the sequencing libraries prepared by 
three methods. The sequencing primers were added through random hybridization 
and ligation to fragmented viral RNA using a RNA-Seq kit in method 1, through 
random reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in method 
2 which was developed in our laboratory, and through hybridization and ligation 
to fragmented amplicons of random RT-PCR using a single primer in method 3. 
Although the results of these three samples (nine libraries) all showed that 
more classified viral families and genera were identified using methods 2 and 3 
than using method 1, and more classified viral families and genera were 
identified using method 2 than using method 3, most of the differences were of 
no statistical significance. Moreover, 11 mammalian viral genera in minks were 
possibly identified for the first time through this study.

Evolutionary genomics of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses (pH1N 1v),"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>A new strain of human H1N1 influenza A viruses was broken out in the April 2009 and caused worldwide pandemic emergency. The present study is trying to estimate a temporal reassortment history of 2009 H1N1 viruses by phylogenetic analysis based on a total 394 sequences of H1N1viruses isolated from swine, human and avian.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Phylogenetic trees of eight gene segments showed that viruses sampled from human formed a well-supported clade, whereas swine and avian lineages were intermixed together. A new divergence swine sublineage containing gene segments of 2009 H1N1 viruses was characterized, which were closely related with swine viruses collected from USA and South Korea during 2004 to 2007 in six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS), and to swine viruses isolated from Thailand during 2004 to 2005 in NA and M. Substitution rates were varied drastically among eight segments and the average substitution rate was generally higher in 2009 H1N1 than in swine and human viruses (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic>

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Our results implied that at least four reassortments or transmissions probably occurred before 2009 H1N1 viruses. Initial reassortment arose in 1976 and avian-like Eurasian swine viruses emerged. The second transmission happened in Asia and North America between 1988 and 1992, and mostly influenced six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS). The third reassortment occurred between North American swine and avian viruses during 1998 to 2000, which involved PB2 and PA segments. Recent reassortments occurred among avian-to-swine reassortant, Eurasian and classical swine viruses during 2004 to 2005. South Korea, Thailand and USA, were identified as locations where reassortments most likely happened. The co-circulation of multiple swine sublineages and special lifestyle in Asia might have facilitated mixing of diverse influenza viruses, leading to generate a novel virus strain.</jats:p>

Here, we review what is known about the microorganisms present in raw milk, 
including milk from cows, sheep, goats and humans. Milk, due to its high 
nutritional content, can support a rich microbiota. These microorganisms enter 
milk from a variety of sources and, once in milk, can play a number of roles, 
such as facilitating dairy fermentations (e.g. Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, 
Streptococcus, Propionibacterium and fungal populations), causing spoilage (e.g. 
Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Bacillus and other spore-forming or thermoduric 
microorganisms), promoting health (e.g. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) or 
causing disease (e.g. Listeria, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and 
mycotoxin-producing fungi). There is also concern that the presence of 
antibiotic residues in milk leads to the development of resistance, particularly 
among pathogenic bacteria. Here, we comprehensively review these topics, while 
comparing the approaches, both culture-dependent and culture-independent, which 
can be taken to investigate the microbial composition of milk.

Low-cost high-throughput methods applicable to any virus strain are required for 
screening antiviral compounds against multiple field strains. Colorimetric 
cell-viability assays are used for this purpose as long as the viruses are 
cytopathic (CP) in cell culture. However, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) 
strains circulating in the field are mostly non-cytopathic (NCP). An In 
Cell-ELISA aimed to measure viral infectivity by detecting a conserved protein 
produced during viral replication (non-structural protein 3, ""NS3"") was 
developed. The ELISA is performed without harvesting the cells, directly on the 
96-wells culture plate. NS3 In Cell-ELISA was tested for its ability to assess 
BVDV-specific antiviral activity of recombinant bovine type I and III IFNs. 
Results correlated to those measured by qRT-PCR and virus titration. NS3 In 
Cell-ELISA was also efficient in estimating the IC50 of two compounds with 
different antiviral activity. Estimation of the 50% inhibition dose of each IFN 
using six BVDV strains of different biotype and genotype showed that CP strains 
were more susceptible to both IFNs than NCP, while type 2 NCP viruses were more 
sensitive to IFN-I. The In Cell-ELISA format using a detector antibody against a 
conserved non-structural protein can be potentially applied to accurately 
measure infectivity of any viral strain.

Genome Dynamics and Molecular Infection Epidemiology of Multidrug-Resistant Helicobacter pullorum Isolates Obtained from Broiler and Free-Range Chickens in India,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Some life-threatening, foodborne, and zoonotic infections are transmitted through poultry birds. Inappropriate and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in the livestock industry has led to an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria with epidemic potential. Here, we present a functional molecular epidemiological analysis entailing the phenotypic and whole-genome sequence-based characterization of 11
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            isolates from broiler and free-range chickens sampled from retail wet markets in Hyderabad City, India. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed all of the isolates to be resistant to multiple antibiotic classes such as fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, and macrolides. The isolates were also found to be extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers and were even resistant to clavulanic acid. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of these isolates revealed the presence of five or six well-characterized antimicrobial resistance genes, including those encoding a resistance-nodulation-division efflux pump(s). Phylogenetic analysis combined with pan-genome analysis revealed a remarkable degree of genetic diversity among the isolates from free-range chickens; in contrast, a high degree of genetic similarity was observed among broiler chicken isolates. Comparative genomic analysis of all publicly available
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            genomes, including our isolates (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 16), together with the genomes of 17 other
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Helicobacter</jats:named-content>
            species, revealed a high number (8,560) of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            -specific protein-encoding genes, with an average of 535 such genes per isolate.
            <jats:italic>In silico</jats:italic>
            virulence screening identified 182 important virulence genes and also revealed high strain-specific gene content in isolates from free-range chickens (average, 34) compared to broiler chicken isolates. A significant prevalence of prophages (ranging from 1 to 9) and a significant presence of genomic islands (0 to 4) were observed in free-range and broiler chicken isolates. Taken together, these observations provide significant baseline data for functional molecular infection epidemiology of nonpyloric
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Helicobacter</jats:named-content>
            species such as

          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Globally, the poultry industry is expanding with an ever-growing consumer base for chicken meat. Given this, food-associated transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria represents an important health care issue. Our study involves a critical baseline approach directed at genome sequence-based epidemiology and transmission dynamics of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            , a poultry pathogen having established zoonotic potential. We believe our studies would facilitate the development of surveillance systems that ensure the safety of food for humans and guide public health policies related to the use of antibiotics in animal feed in countries such as India. We sequenced 11 new genomes of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            as a part of this study. These genomes would provide much value in addition to the ongoing comparative genomic studies of helicobacters.

Papilloma viruses are detected and identified by PCR with consensus primers 
designed from human papilloma virus sequences. These and other primers could not 
detect papilloma virus in bovine teat wart samples despite repeated attempts. 
DNase-SISPA, a metagenomic method for identifying viruses, could identify bovine 
papilloma virus type 10 in bovine teat warts. The sequence comparison between 
consensus primers and bovine papilloma virus type 10 sequences revealed many 
differences between consensus primers and BPV-10 sequences. We suggest, 
DNase-SISPA may be used as an alternate method for papilloma virus diagnosis, in 
cases where PCR fails to identify papilloma viruses.

We have identified a holin-like gene from a goat skin surface metagenome. The 
ORF designated tmp1 coding for 34 amino acids shared sequence similarity with 
putative holin-like toxin genes. To analyze the antibacterial activity of tmp1 
encoded protein, this ORF was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli 
BL21(DE3). The expressed gene product Tmp1 exhibited antibacterial activity 
against Gram-positive bacteria but not to Gram-negative bacteria. A single 
transmembrane domain (TMD) was identified within Tmp1 and deletion analysis of 
the N-terminal region and TMD indicated TMD to be responsible for antibacterial 
activity. The TMD-dependent antibacterial activity was validated using a 
synthetic peptide with the amino acid sequence of TMD. Besides antibacterial 
activity, Tmp1 also complemented the function of holin in a lysis-defective 
bacteriophage lambda. To broaden the spectrum of antibacterial activity, a 
mutant library of tmp1 was generated by random mutagenesis. Four mutants with 
amino acid substitutions at the N-terminus of Tmp1 exhibited increased 
antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and were 
not hemolytic. An improved activity of these mutant proteins is attributed to 
their increased hydrophobicity.

Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis is one of 
the high economic importance diseases of cattle and caused by bovine 
herpesvirus1 (BoHV1). Based on the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting of 
viral DNA, the BoHV1 can be divided into three subtypes viz., BoHV1.1, 1.2a, and 
1.2b. Since this method requires a pure viral DNA, it is time-consuming and 
labour intense. In the current study, the UL0.5 gene based PCR sequencing has 
been used for the subtyping of BoHV1. Out of five isolates, four had BoHV1-like 
signatures and one isolate had BoHV1.2-like signatures. Further, these viruses 
phylogenetically clustered under the respective subtypes. These results indicate 
that the UL 0.5 gene based PCR sequencing could be used as an alternate method 
of subtyping of BoHV1.

BACKGROUND: Human influenza virus isolates generally grow poorly in embryonated 
chicken eggs. Hence, gene reassortment of influenza A wild type (wt) viruses is 
performed with a highly egg adapted donor virus, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), to 
provide the high yield reassortant (HYR) viral 'seeds' for vaccine production. 
HYR must contain the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of wt virus 
and one to six 'internal' genes from PR8. Most studies of influenza wt and HYRs 
have focused on the HA gene. The main objective of this study is the 
identification of the molecular signature in all eight gene segments of 
influenza A HYR candidate vaccine seeds associated with high growth in ovo.
METHODOLOGY: The genomes of 14 wt parental viruses, 23 HYRs (5 H1N1; 2, 1976 
H1N1-SOIV; 2, 2009 H1N1pdm; 2 H2N2 and 12 H3N2) and PR8 were sequenced using the 
high-throughput sequencing pipeline with big dye terminator chemistry.
RESULTS: Silent and coding mutations were found in all internal genes derived 
from PR8 with the exception of the M gene. The M gene derived from PR8 was 
invariant in all 23 HYRs underlining the critical role of PR8 M in high yield 
phenotype. None of the wt virus derived internal genes had any silent change(s) 
except the PB1 gene in X-157. The highest number of recurrent silent and coding 
mutations was found in NS. With respect to the surface antigens, the majority of 
HYRs had coding mutations in HA; only 2 HYRs had coding mutations in NA.
SIGNIFICANCE: In the era of application of reverse genetics to alter influenza A 
virus genomes, the mutations identified in the HYR gene segments associated with 
high growth in ovo may be of great practical benefit to modify PR8 and/or wt 
virus gene sequences for improved growth of vaccine 'seed' viruses.

Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1), or Newcastle disease virus, is the 
causative agent of Newcastle disease, one of the most economically important 
diseases for poultry production worldwide and a cause of periodic epizootics in 
wild birds in North America. In this study, we examined the genetic diversity of 
APMV-1 isolated from migratory birds sampled in Alaska, Japan, and Russia and 
assessed the evidence for intercontinental virus spread using phylogenetic 
methods. Additionally, we predicted viral virulence using deduced amino acid 
residues for the fusion protein cleavage site and estimated mutation rates for 
the fusion gene of class I and class II migratory bird isolates. All 73 isolates 
sequenced as part of this study were most closely related to virus genotypes 
previously reported for wild birds; however, five class II genotype I isolates 
formed a monophyletic clade exhibiting previously unreported genetic diversity, 
which met criteria for the designation of a new sub-genotype. Phylogenetic 
analysis of wild-bird isolates provided evidence for intercontinental virus 
spread, specifically viral lineages of APMV-1 class II genotype I sub-genotypes 
Ib and Ic. This result supports migratory bird movement as a possible mechanism 
for the redistribution of APMV-1. None of the predicted deduced amino acid 
motifs for the fusion protein cleavage site of APMV-1 strains isolated from 
migratory birds in Alaska, Japan, and Russia were consistent with those of 
previously identified virulent viruses. These data therefore provide no support 
for these strains contributing to the emergence of avian pathogens. The 
estimated mutation rates for fusion genes of class I and class II wild-bird 
isolates were faster than those reported previously for non-virulent APMV-1 
strains. Collectively, these findings provide new insight into the diversity, 
spread, and evolution of APMV-1 in wild birds.

The fecal virome comprises a complex diversity of eukaryotic viruses, phages and 
viruses that infect the host. However, little is known about the intestinal 
community of viruses that is present in wild waterfowl, and the structure of 
this community in wild ducks has not yet been studied. The fecal virome 
compositions of six species of wild dabbling ducks and one species of wild 
diving duck were thus analyzed. Fecal samples were collected directly from the 
rectums of 60 ducks donated by hunters. DNA and RNA virus particles were 
purified and sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina platform. The reads obtained 
from the sequencing were analyzed and compared with sequences in the GenBank 
database. Viral-related sequences from the Herpesviridae, Alloherpesviridae, 
Adenoviridae, Retroviridae and Myoviridae viral families showed the highest 
overall abundances in the samples. The virome analysis identified viruses that 
had not been found in wild duck feces and revealed distinct virome profiles 
between different species and between samples of the same species. This study 
increases our understanding of viruses in wild ducks as possible viral 
reservoirs and provides a basis for further studying and monitoring the 
transmission of viruses from wild animals to humans and disease outbreaks in 
domestic animals.

(Bethesda, MD) and Michael Wiebe (San Francisco, CA) In June of 2010, results of 
metagenomic and panmicrobial microarray analysis of a number of commercially 
available vaccine products were published, identifying the unexpected presence 
of porcine circovirus (PCV) in of one of the vaccine products tested. This 
testing did not detect any sequences of contaminating viruses in RotaTeq® 
(rotavirus vaccine, live, oral, pentavalent, RV5, Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse 
Station, NJ). To confirm this finding, Merck developed and applied a number of 
polymerase chain reaction-based analytical methods and a test algorithm to 
systematically demonstrate the absence of infectious PCV in RotaTeq®. This paper 
will describe the methodology and rationale developed to thoroughly assess key 
starting materials, product intermediates, and final product to demonstrate the 
absence of infectious PCV, and the continued quality of this product. This 
approach could be applied to assess the validity of other adventitious agent 
risks encountered in biological processes and products.

Rapid identification of the etiologic agent in infected animals is important for 
the control of an outbreak of vesicular disease in livestock. We have in the 
present study developed a multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR, based 
on primer-probe energy transfer (PriProET), for simultaneous detection and 
differentiation of three Office International des Epizooties (OIE) classified 
vesicular viruses: foot-and-mouth disease virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and 
swine vesicular disease, causing clinically indistinguishable vesicular diseases 
in swine. The multiplex assay consists of extraction of total RNA from clinical 
samples; reverse transcription to cDNA using random primers and one-tube 
real-time amplification of cDNA using multiplex PriProET with specific 
fluorescent-labelled primers and probes for detection of the three viruses from 
the vesicular disease complex. The probes are labelled with unique reporter 
fluorophores, which during amplification are excited by donor fluorophores 
incorporated in the 5' end of specific amplicons by primer extension. The 
sensitivity of the multiplex assay was approximately 100 TCID(50), which is 
10-fold lower compared to the individual PriProET assays for the three vesicular 
viruses.

Although infectious diseases impose a heavy economic burden on the cattle 
industry, the etiology of many disorders that affect livestock is not fully 
elucidated, and effective countermeasures are often lacking. The main tools 
available until now have been vaccines, antibiotics and antiparasitic drugs. 
Although these have been very successful in some cases, the appearance of 
parasite and microbial resistance to these treatments is a cause of concern. 
Next-generation sequencing provides important opportunities to tackle problems 
associated with pathogenic illnesses. This review describes the rapid gains 
achieved to track disease progression, identify the pathogens involved, and map 
pathogen interactions with the host. Use of novel genomic tools subsequently 
aids in treatment development, as well as successful creation of breeding 
programs aimed toward less susceptible livestock. These may be important tools 
for mitigating the long term effects of combating infection and helping reduce 
the reliance on antibiotic treatment.

BACKGROUND: Across the world, ticks act as vectors of human and animal 
pathogens. Ticks rely on bacterial endosymbionts, which often share close and 
complex evolutionary links with tick-borne pathogens. As the prevalence, 
diversity and virulence potential of tick-borne agents remain poorly understood, 
there is a pressing need for microbial surveillance of ticks as potential 
disease vectors.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a two-stage protocol that includes 
16S-amplicon screening of pooled samples of hard ticks collected from dogs, 
sheep and camels in Palestine, followed by shotgun metagenomics on individual 
ticks to detect and characterise tick-borne pathogens and endosymbionts. Two 
ticks isolated from sheep yielded an abundance of reads from the genus 
Rickettsia, which were assembled into draft genomes. One of the resulting 
genomes was highly similar to Rickettsia massiliae strain MTU5. Analysis of 
signature genes showed that the other represents the first genome sequence of 
the potential pathogen Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae. Ticks from a dog and a 
sheep yielded draft genome sequences of Coxiella strains. A sheep tick yielded 
sequences from the sheep pathogen Anaplasma ovis, while Hyalomma ticks from 
camels yielded sequences belonging to Francisella-like endosymbionts. From the 
metagenome of a dog tick from Jericho, we generated a genome sequence of a 
canine parvovirus.
SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we have shown how a cost-effective two-stage protocol can be 
used to detect and characterise tick-borne pathogens and endosymbionts. In 
recovering genome sequences from an unexpected pathogen (canine parvovirus) and 
a previously unsequenced pathogen (Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae), we 
demonstrate the open-ended nature of metagenomics. We also provide evidence that 
ticks can carry canine parvovirus, raising the possibility that ticks might 
contribute to the spread of this troublesome virus.

Networks inference problems are commonly found in multiple biomedical subfields 
such as genomics, metagenomics, neuroscience, and epidemiology. Networks are 
useful for representing a wide range of complex interactions ranging from those 
between molecular biomarkers, neurons, and microbial communities, to those found 
in human or animal populations. Recent technological advances have resulted in 
an increasing amount of healthcare data in multiple modalities, increasing the 
preponderance of network inference problems. Multi-domain data can now be used 
to improve the robustness and reliability of recovered networks from unimodal 
data. For infectious diseases in particular, there is a body of knowledge that 
has been focused on combining multiple pieces of linked information. Combining 
or analyzing disparate modalities in concert has demonstrated greater insight 
into disease transmission than could be obtained from any single modality in 
isolation. This has been particularly helpful in understanding incidence and 
transmission at early stages of infections that have pandemic potential. Novel 
pieces of linked information in the form of spatial, temporal, and other 
covariates including high-throughput sequence data, clinical visits, social 
network information, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and clinical symptoms 
(reported as free-text data) also encourage further investigation of these 
methods. The purpose of this review is to provide an in-depth analysis of 
multimodal infectious disease transmission network inference methods with a 
specific focus on Bayesian inference. We focus on analytical Bayesian 
inference-based methods as this enables recovering multiple parameters 
simultaneously, for example, not just the disease transmission network, but also 
parameters of epidemic dynamics. Our review studies their assumptions, key 
inference parameters and limitations, and ultimately provides insights about 
improving future network inference methods in multiple applications.

Viruses are ubiquitous in the oceans and critical components of marine microbial 
communities, regulating nutrient transfer to higher trophic levels or to the 
dissolved organic pool through lysis of host cells. Hydrothermal vent systems 
are oases of biological activity in the deep oceans, for which knowledge of 
biodiversity and its impact on global ocean biogeochemical cycling is still in 
its infancy. In order to gain biological insight into viral communities present 
in hydrothermal vent systems, we developed a method based on deep-sequencing of 
pulsed field gel electrophoretic bands representing key viral fractions present 
in seawater within and surrounding a hydrothermal plume derived from Loki's 
Castle vent field at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. The reduction in virus 
community complexity afforded by this novel approach enabled the near-complete 
reconstruction of a lambda-like phage genome from the virus fraction of the 
plume. Phylogenetic examination of distinct gene regions in this lambdoid phage 
genome unveiled diversity at loci encoding superinfection exclusion- and 
integrase-like proteins. This suggests the importance of fine-tuning lyosgenic 
conversion as a viral survival strategy, and provides insights into the nature 
of host-virus and virus-virus interactions, within hydrothermal plumes. By 
reducing the complexity of the viral community through targeted sequencing of 
prominent dsDNA viral fractions, this method has selectively mimicked virus 
dominance approaching that hitherto achieved only through culturing, thus 
enabling bioinformatic analysis to locate a lambdoid viral ""needle"" within the 
greater viral community ""haystack"". Such targeted analyses have great potential 
for accelerating the extraction of biological knowledge from diverse and poorly 
understood environmental viral communities.

Porcine sapelovirus (PSV) A belongs to the genus Sapelovirus, family 
Picornaviridae. PSV infections in pigs have been reported from European 
countries, United States, Japan, China, Korea and Brazil. The virus has been 
isolated/detected from faeces of healthy pigs as well as those affected with 
diarrhoea, respiratory signs, encephalitis, skin lesions and fertility 
disorders. This study was planned to investigate whether PSV is prevalent among 
pigs in India and to characterize PSV encountered in the study population. The 
study revealed that five of 70 (7.14%) faecal samples were found positive for 
PSV using RT-PCR. Three viruses were successfully isolated from faecal samples 
using IB-RS-2 cell line. Complete genome sequencing and analysis of one Indian 
PSV isolate revealed highest homology (88%) with V13 strain from England. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the complete polyprotein nucleotide sequences of 14 
strains of PSV classified the viruses into four distinct clades. This first 
report from India adds to our knowledge on genetic diversity of PSV detected so 
far among pigs in different countries. A large-scale surveillance of the virus 
is required to understand its genomic diversity and economic impact.

Buffalo rumen microbiota experience variety of diets and represents a huge 
reservoir of mobilome, resistome and stress responses. However, knowledge of 
metagenomic responses to such conditions is still rudimentary. We analyzed the 
metagenomes of buffalo rumen in the liquid and solid phase of the rumen 
biomaterial from river buffalo adapted to varying proportion of concentrate to 
green or dry roughages, using high-throughput sequencing to know the occurrence 
of antibiotics resistance genes, genetic exchange between bacterial population 
and environmental reservoirs. A total of 3914.94 MB data were generated from all 
three treatments group. The data were analysed with Metagenome rapid annotation 
system tools. At phyla level, Bacteroidetes were dominant in all the treatments 
followed by Firmicutes. Genes coding for functional responses to stress 
(oxidative stress and heat shock proteins) and resistome genes (resistance to 
antibiotics and toxic compounds, phages, transposable elements and pathogenicity 
islands) were prevalent in similar proportion in liquid and solid fraction of 
rumen metagenomes. The fluoroquinolone resistance, MDR efflux pumps and 
Methicillin resistance genes were broadly distributed across 11, 9, and 14 
bacterial classes, respectively. Bacteria responsible for phages replication and 
prophages and phage packaging and rlt-like streptococcal phage genes were mostly 
assigned to phyla Bacteroides, Firmicutes and proteaobacteria. Also, more reads 
matching the sigma B genes were identified in the buffalo rumen. This study 
underscores the presence of diverse mechanisms of adaptation to different diet, 
antibiotics and other stresses in buffalo rumen, reflecting the proportional 
representation of major bacterial groups.

(742 bp) and P gene between nucleotide P239-P750 (512 bp). The N gene could be 
amplified from 30, while P gene from 41 samples, using specific sets of primers. 
The N gene-based phylogenetic analysis indicated that all Indian virus isolates 
are genetically closely related with a single cluster under arctic/arctic-like 
viruses. However, two distinct clusters were realized in P gene-based phylogeny 
viz., Rabies virus isolates of Punjab and Rabies virus isolates of remaining 
parts of India (other than Punjab). All the Indian rabies virus isolates were 
closely related to geography (>95% homology), but not to host species.

Genetic Characterization of the Belgian Nephropathogenic Infectious Bronchitis Virus (NIBV) Reference Strain B1648,"<jats:p>The virulent nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) strain B1648 was first isolated in 1984, in Flanders, Belgium. Despite intensive vaccination, B1648 and its variants are still circulating in Europe and North Africa. Here, the full-length genome of this Belgian NIBV reference strain was determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) to understand its evolutionary relationship with other IBV strains, and to identify possible genetic factors that may be associated with the nephropathogenicity. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in the B1648 strain (51UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-31UTR). ORFs 4b, 4c and 6b, which have been rarely reported in literature, were present in B1648 and most of the other IBV complete genomes. According to phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome, replicase transcriptase complex, spike protein, partial S1 gene and M protein, B1648 strain clustered with the non-Massachusetts type strains NGA/A116E7/2006, UKr 27-11, QX-like ITA/90254/2005, QX-like CK/SWE/0658946/10, TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05. Based on the partial S1 fragment, B1648 clustered with the strains TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05 and, further designated as B1648 genotype. The full-length genome of B1648 shared the highest sequence homology with UKr 27-11, Gray, JMK, and NGA/A116E7/2006 (91.2% to 91.6%) and was least related with the reference Beaudette and Massachusetts strains (89.7%). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses indicated that B1648 strain may have played an important role in the evolution of IBV in Europe and North Africa. Further, the nephropathogenicity determinants might be located on the 1a, spike, M and accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b). Overall, strain B1648 is distinct from all the strains reported so far in Europe and other parts of the world.</jats:p>",0

Quantifying and predicting the antigenic characteristics of a virus is something 
of a holy grail for infectious disease research because of its central 
importance to the emergence of new strains, the severity of outbreaks, and 
vaccine selection. However, these characteristics are defined by a complex 
interplay of viral and host factors so that phylogenetic measures of viral 
similarity are often poorly correlated to antigenic relationships. Here, we 
generate antigenic phylogenies that track the phenotypic evolution of two 
serotypes of foot-and-mouth disease virus by combining host serology and viral 
sequence data to identify sites that are critical to their antigenic evolution. 
For serotype SAT1, we validate our antigenic phylogeny against monoclonal 
antibody escape mutants, which match all of the predicted antigenic sites. For 
serotype O, we validate it against known sites where available, and otherwise 
directly evaluate the impact on antigenic phenotype of substitutions in 
predicted sites using reverse genetics and serology. We also highlight a 
critical and poorly understood problem for vaccine selection by revealing 
qualitative differences between assays that are often used interchangeably to 
determine antigenic match between field viruses and vaccine strains. Our 
approach provides a tool to identify naturally occurring antigenic 
substitutions, allowing us to track the genetic diversification and associated 
antigenic evolution of the virus. Despite the hugely important role vaccines 
have played in enhancing human and animal health, vaccinology remains a 
conspicuously empirical science. This study advances the field by providing 
guidance for tuning vaccine strains via site-directed mutagenesis through this 
high-resolution tracking of antigenic evolution of the virus between rare major 
shifts in phenotype.

Captive and wild psittacines are vulnerable to the highly contagious psittacine 
beak and feather disease. The causative agent, beak and feather disease virus 
(BFDV), was recently detected in the largest remaining population of endangered 
Cape parrots (Poicepahlus robustus), which are endemic to South Africa. 
Full-length genomes were isolated and sequenced from 26 blood samples collected 
from wild and captive Cape parrots to determine possible origins of infection. 
All sequences had characteristic BFDV sequence motifs and were similar in length 
to those described in the literature. However, BFDV coat protein (CP) sequences 
from this study did not contain a previously identified bipartite nuclear 
localisation signal (NLS) within residues 39-56, which indicates that an 
alternate NLS is involved in shuttling the CP into the nucleus. Sequences from 
the wild population shared a high degree of similarity, irrespective of year or 
location, suggesting that the disease outbreak occurred close to the time when 
the samples were collected. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes showed 
that the captive Cape parrot sequences cluster with those isolated from 
captive-bred budgerigars in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Exposure to 
captive-bred Cape parrots from a breeding facility in KwaZulu-Natal is suggested 
as a possible source for the virus infection. Phylogenetic analysis of BFDV 
isolates from wild and captive Cape parrots indicated two separate infection 
events in different populations, which highlights the potential risk of 
introducing new strains of the virus into the wild population. The present study 
represents the first systematic investigation of BFDV virus diversity in the 
southern-most population of Cape parrots.

"Faustovirus, an Asfarvirus-Related New Lineage of Giant Viruses Infecting Amoebae","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Giant viruses are protist-associated viruses belonging to the proposed order
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Megavirales</jats:named-content>
            ; almost all have been isolated from
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Acanthamoeba</jats:named-content>
            spp. Their isolation in humans suggests that they are part of the human virome. Using a high-throughput strategy to isolate new giant viruses from their original protozoan hosts, we obtained eight isolates of a new giant viral lineage from
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Vermamoeba</jats:named-content>
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">vermiformis</jats:named-content>
            , the most common free-living protist found in human environments. This new lineage was proposed to be the faustovirus lineage. The prototype member, faustovirus E12, forms icosahedral virions of ≈200 nm that are devoid of fibrils and that encapsidate a 466-kbp genome encoding 451 predicted proteins. Of these, 164 are found in the virion. Phylogenetic analysis of the core viral genes showed that faustovirus is distantly related to the mammalian pathogen African swine fever virus, but it encodes ≈3 times more mosaic gene complements. About two-thirds of these genes do not show significant similarity to genes encoding any known proteins. These findings show that expanding the panel of protists to discover new giant viruses is a fruitful strategy.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is classified in the genus Hepacivirus of the family 
Flaviviridae, whose members have a single-stranded RNA genome of positive 
polarity, which encodes a single polyprotein. Within this family, HCV is closely 
related to viruses of the genus Pestivirus, which includes classical swine fever 
virus (CSFV). Translation of the hepaci- and pestiviral polyprotein is initiated 
by internal entry of ribosomes, promoted by the 5'NTR. The secondary and 
tertiary RNA structures of the HCV and pestivirus 5'NTRs are well conserved, 
despite the fact that their sequences differ significantly from one another. By 
analogy with other positive-stranded RNA viruses, the 5'NTR of HCV is likely to 
contain cis-acting determinants for replication as well as the determinants for 
translation. Studies on both signals could be complicated, as these signals 
might overlap. In this study, this problem was addressed by constructing 
chimeric HCV/CSFV 5'NTRs. A two-step analysis of these 5'NTRs was performed: (a) 
in a translation assay, which provided the possibility to study translation 
independently of the possible effects on replication; and (b) in a replication 
assay, in which were studied only the chimeric 5'NTRs for which IRES-dependent 
translation was demonstrated. An overlap was observed between HCV RNA elements 
involved in these processes. Exchange of domain II had a minor effect on the 
translation efficiency of the chimeric 5'NTRs, while replication of subgenomic 
replicons with these chimeric 5'NTRs was abolished. Exchange of domain III 
subdomains severely decreased translation activity, while replication was 
maintained.

Kobuviruses – a comprehensive review,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Kobuviruses are members of the large and growing family <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>. Until now, two official, <jats:italic>Aichi virus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Bovine kobuvirus,</jats:italic> and one candidate kobuvirus species, ‘porcine kobuvirus’, have been identified in human, cattle and swine, respectively. In addition, kobu‐like viruses were detected very recently in the bat. Aichi virus could be one of the causative agents of gastroenteritis in humans, and kobuviruses probably also cause diarrhoea in cattle and swine. Although Aichi virus has been detected relatively infrequently (0–3%) in human diarrhoea, high seroprevalence, up to 80–95% at the age of 30–40, was found indicating the general nature of infection in different human populations. In the previous years, much new information has accumulated relating to kobuviruses and their host species. This review summarises the current knowledge on kobuviruses including taxonomy, biology and viral characteristics, and covers all aspects of infection including epidemiology, clinical picture, host species diversity, laboratory diagnosis and it gives a summary about possible future perspectives.

The family Astroviridae consists of two genera, Avastrovirus and Mamastrovirus 
whose members are associated with gastroenteritis in avian and mammalian hosts, 
respectively. In this study, we report the first detection of astrovirus from 
fecal specimens of wild boars (Sus scrofa) using viral metagenomics and complete 
genome sequencing. The wild boar astrovirus (WBAstV-1/2011/HUN, JQ340310) genome 
is 6707 nucleotide long and had 76%, 95% and 56% amino acid (aa) identity in the 
ORF1a (852aa), ORF1b (522aa) and ORF2 (845aa) regions, respectively, to porcine 
astrovirus 4 (PAstV-4, JF713713), the closest match. This study indicates that 
wild boar could be a reservoir for astroviruses.

Fecal samples (N = 10) from 6- to 8-week-old wild boar piglets (Sus scrofa), 
collected from an animal park in Hungary in April 2011, were analyzed using 
viral metagenomics and complete genome sequencing. Kobuvirus (genus Kobuvirus,

nucleotide (89 %) and amino acid (94 %) sequence identity of the strain wild 
boar/WB1-HUN/2011/HUN (JX177612) to the prototype porcine kobuvirus S-1-HUN 
(EU787450). This study suggests that genetically highly similar (practically the 
same geno-/serotype) porcine kobuvirus circulate in wild boars, the wildlife 
counterparts of domestic pigs. Wild boars could be an important host and

Isolates of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were segregated into two groups 
based on comparison of sequences from the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the 
viral genome. Phylogenic analysis suggested that these groups, termed BVDV I and 
BVDV II, are as different from each other as reference BVDV (BVDV-NADL, 
BVDV-SD-1, BVDV-Osloss) are from hog cholera virus. Polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) tests, based on the 5' untranslated region and the genomic region coding 
for the p125 polypeptide, were designed to differentiate between BVDV I and BVDV 
II. Using these tests, 76 of 140 isolates of BVDV were identified as BVDV II. 
Antigenic and pathologic differences were noted between BVDV I and BVDV II 
viruses. Among BVDV I were viruses commonly used in vaccine production, 
diagnostic tests, and research. BVDV II was isolated predominantly from fetal 
bovine sera, persistently infected calves born to dams vaccinated against BVDV, 
and cattle that had died from an acute form of BVDV termed hemorrhagic syndrome.

A novel adenovirus, CeAdV1, was isolated from buffy coat and nasal swab samples 
collected from two captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawns. The 
isolation was an incidental finding in the course of screening animals for use 
in a research study on an unrelated pathogen. In the screening process, virus 
isolation was performed on both nasal swabs and buffy coat samples and 
cytopathic effect was observed. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles 
with the shape and morphology of an adenovirus. Next generation sequencing 
followed by phylogenetic analysis classified this virus to the Mastadenovirus 
genus. Its sequence was genetically distinct from all other recognized species 
in this genus, with only 76% sequence identity to its closest genetic match, 
bovine adenovirus 3 (BAdV3). The virus could be propagated in bovine derived 
cells but grew to a higher titer in cervid derived cells. Inoculation of 
white-tailed deer fawns with the isolated virus resulted in pyrexia, depletion 
of thymus tissue and mild respiratory disease. Comparative serology performed 
using convalescent sera revealed distinct antigenic differences between the 
novel cervid adenovirus and BAdV3. A retrospective serological survey of the 
captive deer herd indicated that this virus had been circulating in the herd for 
at least 14 years with no report of clinical disease. A survey of serum 
collected from free ranging mule deer residing in Nevada revealed high serum 
titers against this novel adenovirus.

Stability of the Parainfluenza Virus 5 Genome Revealed by Deep Sequencing of Strains Isolated from Different Hosts and following Passage in Cell Culture,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The strain diversity of a rubulavirus, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), was investigated by comparing 11 newly determined and 6 previously published genome sequences. These sequences represent 15 PIV5 strains, of which 6 were isolated from humans, 1 was from monkeys, 2 were from pigs, and 6 were from dogs. Strain diversity is remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographical origin; a total of 7.8% of nucleotides are variable, and the average pairwise difference between strains is 2.1%. Variation is distributed unevenly across the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of selection for antibody-mediated evasion in hemagglutinin-neuraminidase was found. The finding that some canine and porcine, but not primate, strains are mutated in the SH gene, and do not produce SH, raised the possibility that dogs (or pigs) may not be the natural host of PIV5. The genetic stability of PIV5 was also demonstrated during serial passage of one strain (W3) in Vero cells at a high multiplicity of infection, under conditions of competition with large proportions of defective interfering genomes. A similar observation was made for a strain W3 mutant (PIV5VΔC) lacking V gene function, in which the dominant changes were related to pseudoreversion in this gene. The mutations detected in PIV5VΔC during pseudoreversion, and also those characterizing the SH gene in canine and porcine strains, predominantly involved U-to-C transitions. This suggests an important role for biased hypermutation via an adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific (ADAR)-like activity.</jats:p>

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Here we report the sequence variation of 16 different isolates of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) that were isolated from a number of species, including humans, monkeys, dogs, and pigs, over 4 decades. Surprisingly, strain diversity was remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographical origin. Variation was distributed unevenly across the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of immune or host selection was found. This overall genome stability of PIV5 was also observed when the virus was grown in the laboratory, and the genome stayed remarkably constant even during the selection of virus mutants. Some of the canine isolates had lost their ability to encode one of the viral proteins, termed SH, suggesting that although PIV5 commonly infects dogs, dogs may not be the natural host for PIV5.

New Minto virus: a new rhabdovirus from ticks in Alaska,"<jats:p> Three strains of a virus were isolated from Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris (Packard) ticks removed from snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) in east central Alaska. We suggest that the virus be named New Minto for the location in which the ticks were collected. Prototype New Minto virus is sensitive to the action of sodium deoxycholate and kills suckling mice by the intracerebral but not intraperitoneal route; weaned mice do not die after intracerebral, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous inoculation. The virus produces plaque in serially propagated Vero but not in primary Pekin duck embryo cells.By complement-fixation and neutralization tests New Minto is related to Sawgrass virus, a hitherto ungrouped virus from Florida. The establishment of a Sawgrass group is suggested. In addition, Sawgrass virus was found by electron microscopy to belong to the Family Rhabdoviridae. </jats:p>",0

Influenza A viruses have a segmented, negative-stranded RNA genome. These 
viruses are classified according to the antigenic properties of the two 
glycoproteins, expressed on the surface of the virus particles, the 
hemagglutinin (HA or H) and the neuraminidase (NA or N). To date, 17 H and 10 N 
have been described and 116 HxNy combinations or subtypes reported. Except for 
the H17N10 subtype recently identified in bats, all identified subtypes have 
been identified in wild aquatic birds. These birds are considered to be the 
natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, from which some subtypes can be 
transmitted to other bird and mammal species, including humans. Interspecies 
transmissions seem to occur regularly, and can occasionally lead to the 
adaptation and stable establishment of a new viral lineage in a given species. 
This review recalls the genetic diversity of avian, swine and human influenza 
viruses and focuses on lesser-known influenza A viruses, identified in horses, 
dogs and very recently in bats. It discusses the genetic mixing that may result 
from interspecies transmission, and the associated risks of epizootics, zoonosis 
and pandemics.

Detection of Cattle Infected with Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Using Nucleic Acid Hybridization,"<jats:p> A ribonucleic acid (RNA) hybridization assay to identify cattle infected by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is described. The RNA probe was derived from the coding region at the 3′ end of the genome of the NADL strain of BVDV. Total RNA from infected cell cultures or peripheral blood leukocytes from suspect animals was extracted and applied to nylon membranes with a slot blot apparatus. Peripheral blood leukocytes were tested concurrently for BVDV by virus isolation. The results of hybridization and virus isolation were in agreement for 92% of the cases. When compared with virus isolation, hybridization had a sensitivity of detection of 59.5% and a specificity of 95%. Cross-reactivity to RNA extracts of border disease virus-infected cells was noted. No cross-reactivity was detected to other common bovine viruses (bovine herpesvirus-l, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, and bluetongue virus), to viruses classified in related families (equine arteritis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), or to viruses having similar genomic organization (dengue virus type 2 and Japanese encephalitis virus). </jats:p>",0

Outbreaks of infection can be devastating for individuals and societies. In this 
review, we examine the applications of new high-throughput sequencing approaches 
to the identification and characterization of outbreaks, focusing on the 
application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to outbreaks of bacterial 
infection. We describe traditional epidemiological analysis and show how WGS can 
be informative at multiple steps in outbreak investigation, as evidenced by many 
recent studies. We conclude that high-throughput sequencing approaches can make 
a significant contribution to the investigation of outbreaks of bacterial 
infection and that the integration of WGS with epidemiological investigation, 
diagnostic assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing will precipitate 
radical changes in clinical microbiology and infectious disease epidemiology in 
the near future. However, several challenges remain before WGS can be routinely 
used in outbreak investigation and clinical practice.

Nipah and Hendra virus are members of a newly identified genus of emerging 
paramyxoviruses, the henipaviruses. Both viruses have the ability to cause 
severe pulmonary infection and severe acute encephalitis. Following their 
discovery in the 1990s, outbreaks caused by these zoonotic paramyxoviruses have 
been associated with high public health and especially economic threat 
potential. Currently, only geographic groupings in Asia and Australia have been 
described for the henipaviruses. However, while few viral isolates are available 
and more detailed characterization is necessary, there has been recent evidence 
that divergent henipaviruses might be present on the African continent. This 
review endeavours to capture recent advances in the field of henipavirus 
research, with a focus on genome structure and replication mechanisms, reservoir 
hosts, genetic diversity, pathogenesis and animal models.

Bovine leukemia virus can be classified into seven genotypes: evidence for the existence of two novel clades,"<jats:p>Previous studies have classified the <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> sequences of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) provirus from different locations worldwide into between two and four genetic groupings. These different studies gave unique names to the identified groups and no study has yet integrated all the available sequences. Thus, we hypothesized that many of the different groups previously identified actually correspond to a limited group of genotypes that are unevenly distributed worldwide. To examine this hypothesis, we sequenced the <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> gene from 28 BLV field strains and compared these sequences to 46 <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> sequences that represent all the genetic groupings already identified. By using phylogenetic analyses, we recovered six clades, or genotypes, that we have called genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Genotypes 1–5 have counterparts among the sequence groupings identified previously. One <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> sequence did not cluster with any of the others and was highly divergent when compared with the six genotypes identified here. Thus, an extra genotype, which we named 7, may exist. Similarity comparisons were highly congruent with phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, our analyses confirmed the existence of geographical clusters.</jats:p>",0
Ultrastructural Findings in Lymph Nodes from Pigs Suffering from Naturally Occurring Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome,"<jats:p> The aims of this study were to evaluate ultrastructural lesions in lymph nodes from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS)-affected pigs and to correlate these alterations with detection of viral-like particles (VLPs). Samples of lymph nodes were taken from 4 PMWS-affected pigs and 2 healthy animals and processed by transmission electron microscopy. Significant ultrastructural alterations were only noted in PMWS-affected pigs, mainly in histiocytes and rarely in other cell types. Histiocytes showed severe swelling and proliferation of mitochondria, and proliferation and dilation of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Infected histiocytes contained large numbers of intracytoplasmic inclusion (ICI) bodies with VLPs; some histiocytes also had intranuclear inclusions (INIs). Small inclusions were surrounded by double membrane, with a granular appearance or containing paracrystalline arrays; icosahedral VLPs were 8–17 nm in diameter. Large ICIs were double-membrane bounded or not and contained VLPs usually forming paracrystalline arrays. ICIs were often found next to mitochondria with severe swelling, and also inside them. INIs were not surrounded by membranes and contained virions of 10–13 nm diameter. Lymphocyte depletion was a striking finding of lymph nodes from PMWS-affected pigs. The inclusion bodies containing VLPs referred to in the present study should be classified as viral factories, suggesting that viral replication is probably a frequent event in macrophages, in which mitochondria might play a role. </jats:p>",0

A pestivirus, isolated from pigs with haemorrhagic lesions, was antigenically 
more similar to border disease (BD) virus than to either hog cholera (HC) or 
bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) viruses. After reverse transcription the genome at 
the 5' end, along with the same region from a BD isolate from sheep, was 
amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned. The region of the p20 
gene was sequenced and compared with published data for BVD and HC viruses. A 
number of motifs were conserved in the amino acid sequences of all the viruses. 
The pig isolate had a greater degree of homology in this region with the BD 
isolate (87%) than with BVD (73%) or HC (74%) viruses. This further confirms the 
BD-like nature of the virus.

Large-scale surveillance is crucial for understanding the evolution and the 
emergence of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in endemic areas. Circulation of 
highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 is continuously causing 
significant economic losses to the Egyptian poultry industry and is a threat to 
public health. In this report, a HPAI H5N1 strain 
(A/chicken/Egypt/Fadllah-7/2014) was detected from a vaccinated flock showing 
clinical signs of infection. Genetic characterization of the isolate indicated a 
high level of nucleotide identity (95-98%) with variant and classical groups of 
H5N1. Moreover, multiple-nucleotide and amino acid alignments revealed several 
prominent and characteristic substitutions in the surface glycoprotein, which 
may have biological relevance to the pathobiology of the virus. Phylogenetic 
analysis demonstrated that the reported isolate closely relates to H5N1 AIVs 
subclade 2.2.1.1 in spite of no reports of this subclade since 2011 from AI 
reported cases in Egyptian avian species. In conclusion, our results highlight 
the re-emergence of a novel H5N1 AIV variant subclade 2.2.1.1 that could escape 
immunity induced by vaccines. This discovery illustrates the importance of 
continuous monitoring of poultry in this country for controlling AIV including 
identifying sources of vaccine seed viruses.

Do Hemagglutinin Genes of Highly Pathogenic Avian influenza Viruses Constitute Unique Phylogenetic Lineages?,"1. Virology. 1995 Jun 1;209(2):664-70. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.1301.

Do hemagglutinin genes of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses constitute

Avian influenza A viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes periodically cause severe 
outbreaks of disease in poultry. The question we wished to address in this study 
is whether these highly pathogenic strains constitute unique lineages or whether 
they and related nonpathogenic viruses are derived from common ancestors in the 
wild bird reservoir. We therefore compared the nucleotide and amino acid 
sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of 15 H5 and 26 H7 influenza A viruses 
isolated over 91 years from a variety of host species in Eurasia, Africa, 
Australia, and North America. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HA genes 
of H5 and H7 viruses that cause severe disease in domestic birds do not form 
unique lineages but share common ancestors with nonpathogenic H5 and H7 viruses. 
These findings predict that highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 influenza A 
viruses will continue to emerge from wild bird reservoirs. Another important 
question is whether H7 influenza viruses found in mammalian species are derived 
from avian strains. We included eight equine influenza viruses and one seal 
isolate in the phylogenetic analysis of H7 HA genes. We could show that the HA 
genes of both, the equine and the seal viruses, shared ancestors with avian H7 
HA genes. This indicates that currently circulating H7 viruses with an avian HA 
gene may have the potential to adapt to mammalian species and to cause an 
influenza outbreak in the new host.

454-Pyrosequencing: A Molecular Battiscope for Freshwater Viral Ecology,"<jats:p>Viruses, the most abundant biological entities on the planet, are capable of infecting organisms from all three branches of life, although the majority infect bacteria where the greatest degree of cellular diversity lies. However, the characterization and assessment of viral diversity in natural environments is only beginning to become a possibility. Through the development of a novel technique for the harvest of viral DNA and the application of 454 pyrosequencing, a snapshot of the diversity of the DNA viruses harvested from a standing pond on a cattle farm has been obtained. A high abundance of viral genotypes (785) were present within the virome. The absolute numbers of lambdoid and Shiga toxin (Stx) encoding phages detected suggested that the depth of sequencing had enabled recovery of only ca. 8% of the total virus population, numbers that agreed within less than an order of magnitude with predictions made by rarefaction analysis. The most abundant viral genotypes in the pond were bacteriophages (93.7%). The predominant viral genotypes infecting higher life forms found in association with the farm were pathogens that cause disease in cattle and humans, e.g. members of the Herpesviridae. The techniques and analysis described here provide a fresh approach to the monitoring of viral populations in the aquatic environment, with the potential to become integral to the development of risk analysis tools for monitoring the dissemination of viral agents of animal, plant and human diseases.</jats:p>",0
"Studies of Genetic Relationships between Bovine, Caprine, Cervine, and Rangiferine Alphaherpesviruses and Improved Molecular Methods for Virus Detection and Identification","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The glycoprotein B (gB) and D (gD) genes from five ruminant alphaherpesviruses, bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine herpesvirus 5 (BHV-5), caprine herpesvirus 1 (CapHV-1), cervine herpesvirus 1, and rangiferine herpesvirus 1, were partially sequenced. The nucleotide sequence alignments revealed a highly conserved gB gene, with homologies ranging between 87.2 and 99.6%, and a more variable gD gene, with homologies ranging between 71.3 and 98.9%. The phylogenetic analysis of the gB and gD nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences revealed that BHV-5 is the most closely related virus to the BHV-1 subtype 1 and BHV-1 subtype 2 cluster and that CapHV-1 is the most distantly related virus. The phylogenetic data showed a close relationship of all the studied viruses with suid herpesvirus 1. On the basis of sequence data for the gB gene, a nested PCR combined with restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of the PCR products was developed for the simultaneous detection and identification of the viruses that were studied. Nested primers from highly conserved sequence stretches were selected in order to amplify a region of 294 bp in all five viruses, and a subsequent REA of the PCR products allowed specific identification. A mimic molecule that served as an internal standard of the amplification efficiency was constructed. The practical diagnostic applicability of the assay was evaluated with clinical samples consisting of semen and organ specimens from experimentally infected animals.</jats:p>",0

The family Circoviridae contains viruses with covalently closed, circular, 
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, including the smallest known autonomously 
replicating, capsid-encoding animal pathogens. Members of this family are known 
to cause fatal diseases in birds and pigs and have been historically classified 
in one of two genera: Circovirus, which contains avian and porcine pathogens, 
and Gyrovirus, which includes a single species (Chicken anemia virus). However, 
over the course of the past six years, viral metagenomic approaches as well as 
degenerate PCR detection in unconventional hosts and environmental samples have 
elucidated a broader host range, including fish, a diversity of mammals, and 
invertebrates, for members of the family Circoviridae. Notably, these methods 
have uncovered a distinct group of viruses that are closely related to members 
of the genus Circovirus and comprise a new genus, Cyclovirus. The discovery of 
new viruses and a re-evaluation of genomic features that characterize members of 
the Circoviridae prompted a revision of the classification criteria used for 
this family of animal viruses. Here we provide details on an updated 
Circoviridae taxonomy ratified by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of 
Viruses in 2016, which establishes the genus Cyclovirus and reassigns the genus 
Gyrovirus to the family Anelloviridae, a separate lineage of animal viruses that 
also contains circular ssDNA genomes. In addition, we provide a new species 
demarcation threshold of 80% genome-wide pairwise identity for members of the 
family Circoviridae, based on pairwise identity distribution analysis, and list 
guidelines to distinguish between members of this family and other eukaryotic 
viruses with circular, ssDNA genomes.

Whiteflies from the Bemisia tabaci species complex have the ability to transmit 
a large number of plant viruses and are some of the most detrimental pests in 
agriculture. Although whiteflies are known to transmit both DNA and RNA viruses, 
most of the diversity has been recorded for the former, specifically for the 
Begomovirus genus. This study investigated the total diversity of DNA and RNA 
viruses found in whiteflies collected from a single site in Florida to evaluate 
if there are additional, previously undetected viral types within the B. tabaci 
vector. Metagenomic analysis of viral DNA extracted from the whiteflies only 
resulted in the detection of begomoviruses. In contrast, whiteflies contained 
sequences similar to RNA viruses from divergent groups, with a diversity that 
extends beyond currently described viruses. The metagenomic analysis of 
whiteflies also led to the first report of a whitefly-transmitted RNA virus 
similar to Cowpea mild mottle virus (CpMMV Florida) (genus Carlavirus) in North 
America. Further investigation resulted in the detection of CpMMV Florida in 
native and cultivated plants growing near the original field site of whitefly 
collection and determination of its experimental host range. Analysis of 
complete CpMMV Florida genomes recovered from whiteflies and plants suggests 
that the current classification criteria for carlaviruses need to be 
reevaluated. Overall, metagenomic analysis supports that DNA plant viruses 
carried by B. tabaci are dominated by begomoviruses, whereas significantly less 
is known about RNA viruses present in this damaging insect vector.

Diverse circovirus-like genome architectures revealed by environmental metagenomics,"<jats:p>Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses with circular genomes are the smallest viruses known to infect eukaryotes. The present study identified 10 novel genomes similar to ssDNA circoviruses through data-mining of public viral metagenomes. The metagenomic libraries included samples from reclaimed water and three different marine environments (Chesapeake Bay, British Columbia coastal waters and Sargasso Sea). All the genomes have similarities to the replication (Rep) protein of circoviruses; however, only half have genomic features consistent with known circoviruses. Some of the genomes exhibit a mixture of genomic features associated with different families of ssDNA viruses (i.e. circoviruses, geminiviruses and parvoviruses). Unique genome architectures and phylogenetic analysis of the Rep protein suggest that these viruses belong to novel genera and/or families. Investigating the complex community of ssDNA viruses in the environment can lead to the discovery of divergent species and help elucidate evolutionary links between ssDNA viruses.</jats:p>",0
Virus discovery in all three major lineages of terrestrial arthropods highlights the diversity of single-stranded DNA viruses associated with invertebrates,"<jats:p>Viruses encoding a replication-associated protein (Rep) within a covalently closed, single-stranded (ss)DNA genome are among the smallest viruses known to infect eukaryotic organisms, including economically valuable agricultural crops and livestock. Although circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS DNA) viruses are a widespread group for which our knowledge is rapidly expanding, biased sampling toward vertebrates and land plants has limited our understanding of their diversity and evolution. Here, we screened terrestrial arthropods for CRESS DNA viruses and report the identification of 44 viral genomes and replicons associated with specimens representing all three major terrestrial arthropod lineages, namely Euchelicerata (spiders), Hexapoda (insects), and Myriapoda (millipedes). We identified virus genomes belonging to three established CRESS DNA viral families (<jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Genomoviridae</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Smacoviridae</jats:italic>); however, over half of the arthropod-associated viral genomes are only distantly related to currently classified CRESS DNA viral sequences. Although members of viral and satellite families known to infect plants (<jats:italic>Geminiviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Nanoviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Alphasatellitidae</jats:italic>) were not identified in this study, these plant-infecting CRESS DNA viruses and replicons are transmitted by hemipterans. Therefore, members from six out of the seven established CRESS DNA viral families circulate among arthropods. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of Reps, including endogenous viral sequences, reported to date from a wide array of organisms revealed that most of the known CRESS DNA viral diversity circulates among invertebrates. Our results highlight the vast and unexplored diversity of CRESS DNA viruses among invertebrates and parallel findings from RNA viral discovery efforts in undersampled taxa.</jats:p>",0
Challenges of the Unknown: Clinical Application of Microbial Metagenomics,"<jats:p>Availability of fast, high throughput and low cost whole genome sequencing holds great promise within public health microbiology, with applications ranging from outbreak detection and tracking transmission events to understanding the role played by microbial communities in health and disease. Within clinical metagenomics, identifying microorganisms from a complex and host enriched background remains a central computational challenge. As proof of principle, we sequenced two metagenomic samples, a known viral mixture of 25 human pathogens and an unknown complex biological model using benchtop technology. The datasets were then analysed using a bioinformatic pipeline developed around recent fast classification methods. A targeted approach was able to detect 20 of the viruses against a background of host contamination from multiple sources and bacterial contamination. An alternative untargeted identification method was highly correlated with these classifications, and over 1,600 species were identified when applied to the complex biological model, including several species captured at over 50% genome coverage. In summary, this study demonstrates the great potential of applying metagenomics within the clinical laboratory setting and that this can be achieved using infrastructure available to nondedicated sequencing centres.</jats:p>",0
Deep sequencing reveals abundant noncanonical retroviral microRNAs in B-cell leukemia/lymphoma,"<jats:p>Viral tumor models have significantly contributed to our understanding of oncogenic mechanisms. How transforming delta-retroviruses induce malignancy, however, remains poorly understood, especially as viral mRNA/protein are tightly silenced in tumors. Here, using deep sequencing of broad windows of small RNA sizes in the bovine leukemia virus ovine model of leukemia/lymphoma, we provide in vivo evidence of the production of noncanonical RNA polymerase III (Pol III)-transcribed viral microRNAs in leukemic B cells in the complete absence of Pol II 5′-LTR–driven transcriptional activity. Processed from a cluster of five independent self-sufficient transcriptional units located in a proviral region dispensable for in vivo infectivity, bovine leukemia virus microRNAs represent ∼40% of all microRNAs in both experimental and natural malignancy. They are subject to strong purifying selection and associate with Argonautes, consistent with a critical function in silencing of important cellular and/or viral targets. Bovine leukemia virus microRNAs are strongly expressed in preleukemic and malignant cells in which structural and regulatory gene expression is repressed, suggesting a key role in tumor onset and progression. Understanding how Pol III-dependent microRNAs subvert cellular and viral pathways will contribute to deciphering the intricate perturbations that underlie malignant transformation.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: The bovine rumen hosts a diverse and complex community of Eukarya, 
Bacteria, Archea and viruses (including bacteriophage). The rumen viral 
population (the rumen virome) has received little attention compared to the 
rumen microbial population (the rumen microbiome). We used massively parallel 
sequencing of virus like particles to investigate the diversity of the rumen 
virome in thirteen lactating Australian Holstein dairy cattle all housed in the 
same location, 12 of which were sampled on the same day.
RESULTS: Fourteen putative viral sequence fragments over 30 Kbp in length were 
assembled and annotated. Many of the putative genes in the assembled contigs 
showed no homology to previously annotated genes, highlighting the large amount 
of work still required to fully annotate the functions encoded in viral genomes. 
The abundance of the contig sequences varied widely between animals, even though 
the cattle were of the same age, stage of lactation and fed the same diets. 
Additionally the twelve animals which were co-habited shared a number of their 
dominant viral contigs. We compared the functional characteristics of our bovine 
viromes with that of other viromes, as well as rumen microbiomes. At the 
functional level, we found strong similarities between all of the viral samples, 
which were highly distinct from the rumen microbiome samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a large amount of between animal variation in 
the bovine rumen virome and that co-habiting animals may have more similar 
viromes than non co-habited animals. We report the deepest sequencing to date of 
the rumen virome. This work highlights the enormous amount of novelty and 
variation present in the rumen virome.

Identification and complete genome sequencing of paramyxoviruses in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) using random access amplification and next generation sequencing technologies,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>During a wildlife screening program for avian influenza A viruses (AIV) and avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) in Belgium, we isolated two hemagglutinating agents from pools of cloacal swabs of wild mallards (<jats:italic>Anas platyrhynchos</jats:italic>) caught in a single sampling site at two different times. AIV and APMV1 were excluded using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing and specific real-time RT-PCR tests.</jats:p>

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            <jats:p>To refine the virological identification of APMV2-10 realized by HI subtyping tests and in lack of validated molecular tests for APMV2-10, random access amplification was used in combination with next generation sequencing for the sequence independent identification of the viruses and the determination of their genomes.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Three different APMVs were identified. From one pooled sample, the complete genome sequence (15054 nucleotides) of an APMV4 was assembled from the random sequences. From the second pooled sample, the nearly complete genome sequence of an APMV6 (genome size of 16236 nucleotides) was determined, as well as a partial sequence for an APMV4. This APMV4 was closely related but not identical to the APMV4 isolated from the first sample. Although a cross-reactivity with other APMV subtypes did not allow formal identification, the HI subtyping revealed APMV4 and APMV6 in the respective pooled samples but failed to identify the co-infecting APMV4 in the APMV6 infected pool.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>These data further contribute to the knowledge about the genetic diversity within the serotypes APMV4 and 6, and confirm the limited sensitivity of the HI subtyping test. Moreover, this study demonstrates the value of a random access nucleic acid amplification method in combination with massive parallel sequencing. Using only a moderate and economical sequencing effort, the characterization and full genome sequencing of APMVs can be obtained, including the identification of viruses in mixed infections.</jats:p>

A viral metagenomic approach using virion enrichment, random amplification and 
next-generation sequencing was used to investigate an undiagnosed cluster of 
dairy cattle presenting with high persistent fever, unresponsive to 
anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory treatment, diarrhoea and redness of nose 
and teat. Serum and whole blood samples were taken in the predicted 
hyperviraemic state of an animal that a few days later presented with these 
clinical signs. Bioinformatics analysis of the resulting data from the DNA virus 
identification workflow (a total of 32 757 sequences with average read length 
335 bases) initially demonstrated the presence of parvovirus-like sequences in 
the tested blood sample. Thorough follow-up using specific real-time RT-PCR 
assays targeting the detected sequence fragments confirmed the presence of these 
sequences in the original sample as well as in a sample of an additional animal, 
but a contamination with an identical genetic signature in negative extraction 
controls was demonstrated. Further investigation using an alternative extraction 
method identified a contamination of the originally used Qiagen extraction 
columns with parvovirus-like nucleic acids or virus particles. Although we did 
not find any relevant virus that could be associated with the disease, these 
observations clearly illustrate the importance of using a proper control 
strategy and follow-up diagnostic tests in any viral metagenomic study.

Markers for Ongoing or Previous Hepatitis E Virus Infection Are as Common in Wild Ungulates as in Humans in Sweden,"<jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a human pathogen with zoonotic spread, infecting both domestic and wild animals. About 17% of the Swedish population is immune to HEV, but few cases are reported annually, indicating that most infections are subclinical. However, clinical hepatitis E may also be overlooked. For identified cases, the source of infection is mostly unknown. In order to identify whether HEV may be spread from wild game, the prevalence of markers for past and/or ongoing infection was investigated in sera and stool samples collected from 260 hunted Swedish wild ungulates. HEV markers were found in 43 (17%) of the animals. The most commonly infected animal was moose (Alces alces) with 19 out of 69 animals (28%) showing HEV markers, followed by wild boar (Sus scrofa) with 21 out of 139 animals (15%), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) with 2 out of 30 animals, red deer (Cervus elaphus) with 1 out of 15 animals, and fallow deer (Dama dama) 0 out of 7 animals. Partial open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of the viral genomes from the animals were sequenced and compared with those from 14 endemic human cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that three humans were infected with HEV strains similar to those from wild boar. These results indicate that wild animals may be a source of transmission to humans and could be an unrecognized public health concern.</jats:p>",0
"Investigation of foot-and mouth disease outbreak in a pig farm at Kollam district of Kerala, India","<jats:p>The present paper describes the investigation of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in a private pig farm at Kotty in Kollam district of Kerala during October 2013. During the clinical phase, severe vesicular lesions on snout and skin around the coronary bands were observed in pigs. A total of 48 serum samples and 12 clinical samples (ruptured snout epithelia) were collected. All serum samples were subjected to indirect 3AB nonstructural protein (NSP) ELISA and liquid phase blocking (LPB) ELISA. In 3AB NSP ELISA, all serum samples were found positive for NSP antibodies indicating infection. In LPB ELISA, 42 of 48 (87.5%) pigs were found to have protective log10 antibody titre of ³1.8 against FMD virus serotypes O, A and Asia 1. All the clinical materials were found positive for serotype O in antigen detection ELISA as well as in multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR). In VP1 region-based phylogenetic analysis, the serotype O isolates causing the outbreak were found to conglomerate within Ind2001 lineage. Pigs infected with FMD may pose rigorous threat to other susceptible domestic livestock as they exhale enormous quantity of virus. As a consequence, they should be included under prophylactic vaccination and surveillance programmes ongoing in the country.</jats:p>",0

Twenty Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates from infected chicken flocks 
during 2001 to 2009 in China were biologically and genetically characterized. 
All the 20 NDVs were categorized into velogenic (n=17) and lentogenic (n=3) 
viruses, respectively, according to the mean death time (MDT) of chicken 
embryos. Velogenic viruses carry the motif (112)R-R-Q-K-R/F(117) (n=14) or 
(112)G-R-Q-G-R/L(117) (n=3) at the F0 cleavage site, while all the lentogenic 
virus had a sequence motif of (112)G-R-Q-G-R/L(117) (n=3) at the same site. 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least three distinct genotypes (genotypes 
I, II and VII) existed in chicken flocks in China and VIId of genotype VII were 
mainly responsible for the present ND panzootic. Two natural recombinants 
(XD/Shandong/08 and QG/Hebei/07) were supposed and identified by the SimPlot 
program, and their two parental-like strains might be from the NDV vaccine 
lineage and VIId velogenic lineage respectively. The results indicate that 
recombination play a role in NDV evolution and the live vaccines have capacity 
to boost NDV evolution by homologous recombination with circulating virus.

[Identification and classification of bovine leukemia virus isolates in Russia 
and Ukraine based on the pol viral gene polymorphism].

[Article in Russian]

Ruzina MN, Andrianov BV, Shaĭkhaev GO, Sulimova GE.

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a widespread specific pathogen of cattle. 
Analysis of the pol viral gene polymorphism has been used to characterize the 
polymorphism of BLV isolates at stock-breeding farms in Russia and Ukraine. The 
fragments of the pol gene corresponding to the reverse transcriptase and 
integrase 494 and 233 bp in size, respectively, have been used for analysis. 
Phylogenetic analysis has revealed several variants of BLV clustered with a high 
bootstrap support in Russia and Ukraine. A new classification of BLV variants is 
suggested. Comparison of phylograms based on the polymorphism of the nucleotide 
sequences of the integrase and reverse transcriptase domains did not show 
topological conflicts. Therefore, recombination between BLV variants has not 
been found.

A universal microchip was developed for genotyping Influenza A viruses. It 
contains two sets of oligonucleotide probes allowing viruses to be classified by 
the subtypes of hemagglutinin (H1-H13, H15, H16) and neuraminidase (N1-N9). 
Additional sets of probes are used to detect H1N1 swine influenza viruses. 
Selection of probes was done in two steps. Initially, amino acid sequences 
specific to each subtype were identified, and then the most specific and 
representative oligonucleotide probes were selected. Overall, between 19 and 24 
probes were used to identify each subtype of hemagglutinin (HA) and 
neuraminidase (NA). Genotyping included preparation of fluorescently labeled PCR 
amplicons of influenza virus cDNA and their hybridization to microarrays of 
specific oligonucleotide probes. Out of 40 samples tested, 36 unambiguously 
identified HA and NA subtypes of Influenza A virus.

"Rabies of canid biotype in wild dog (&lt;i&gt;Lycaon pictus&lt;/i&gt;) and spotted hyaena (&lt;i&gt;Crocuta crocuta&lt;/i&gt;) in Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa in 2014–2015: Diagnosis, possible origins and implications for control","<jats:p>Both domestic and wild carnivore species are commonly diagnosed with rabies virus (RABV) infection in South Africa. Although the majority of confirmed rabies cases in wild carnivore species are reported from the yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata), the rest are from other wild carnivores including the highly endangered wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Lyssavirus infection was confirmed in two wild dogs and a spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) in the Madikwe Game Reserve, North West province in South Africa, in 2014 and 2015, using a direct fluorescent antibody test and immunohistochemistry. There had been no new wild dog introductions to the Madikwe Game Reserve for many years and the wild dogs were last vaccinated against rabies approximately 11 years prior to the incident. The first euthanised wild dog was the last surviving of a break-away pack of 6, and the second was the last of a larger pack of 18, the rest of which died with no carcasses being found or carcasses too decomposed for sampling. Subsequent antigenic typing of the lyssaviruses indicated that they were canid RABVs. The RABVs originating from 22 wild carnivore species, 7 dogs, and a caprine, mostly from the North West province, were genetically characterised by targeting a partial region of the nucleoprotein gene. The nucleotide sequence analyses of these viruses and two previously characterised RABVs confirmed that the outbreak viruses were also canid rabies, phylogenetically clustering with virus isolates originating from black-backed jackals recovered between 2012 and 2015 from the North West province, and domestic dogs from neighbouring communal areas. The source(s) of the mortalities and possible reservoir host(s) for the virus could only be speculated upon from data on specific predator numbers, movements and behaviour, kills, park management and the changing environmental ecology, which were monitored closely in Madikwe over several years. The most likely rabies sources were from boundary fence contacts between wild carnivores within the park, with domestic dogs or cats and/or naturally occurring wild carnivores outside the park. The associated risk of zoonotic infection and threat to important and endangered predators may be mitigated through regional rabies control primarily in domestic dogs and cats, as well as by preventative vaccination of at-risk park employees and their pets. The importance of ongoing prophylactic rabies protection by regular vaccination of highly endangered wildlife carnivores and the submission of carcasses for rabies diagnosis of any wild or domestic animals behaving uncharacteristically or found dead is emphasised.</jats:p>",0

Newcastle disease is an economically important and highly contagious disease 
affecting wild and domestic avian species. Despite extensive vaccination efforts 
within the poultry industry, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) outbreaks causing 
significant economic losses still occur. Rural chickens may act as a potential 
reservoir of NDVs for commercial poultry due to poor biosecurity and inadequate 
vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic 
relationship and molecular characterization of eight NDVs isolated from backyard 
poultry in Iran during 2011-2013. The complete coding sequence of fusion (F) and 
haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes of eight NDVs were determined and 
compared with other published NDVs. Based on inter-population distances and 
phylogenetic topology between available NDV categories, Iranian isolates formed 
a novel VIIl sub-genotype distinct from previous groups designated in genotype 
VII. Furthermore, both F and HN genes of the Iranian isolates shared high 
nucleotide sequence similarity with viruses isolated in China. All viruses 
analysed contained a polybasic cleavage site motif (111G/RRRQKR↓F117), 
indicating that all isolates could be categorized as a virulent pathotype. No 
mutation was observed in the neutralizing epitopes of the F protein. Analysis of 
amino acids associated with neutralizing antigenic sites within the HN protein 
revealed that all isolates exhibited a unique amino acid (Q) at position 347. 
These results emphasize the need for strengthening the biosecurity measures 
implemented on village flocks and practicing a mandatory vaccination programme 
for local poultry. Moreover, continuous monitoring of NDVs in different species 
of birds can help to gain more knowledge about the evolution of this virus and 
prevent future panzootics.

BACKGROUND: The pig faecal virome, which comprises the community of viruses 
present in pig faeces, is complex and consists of pig viruses, bacteriophages, 
transiently passaged plant viruses and other minor virus species. Only little is 
known about factors influencing its general composition. Here, the effect of the 
probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the pig 
faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and 
their piglets, which received either the probiotic bacterium or not.
RESULTS: From 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial, DNA and 
RNA virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled Next 
Generation Sequencing resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. In average, 14% of 
the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses. The 
percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest (55-77%) in the 
samples of the youngest piglets and lowest (8-10%) in the samples of the sows. 
In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22-44% in 
the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows. The dominating mammalian 
viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets (kobuvirus), 54 day-old 
piglets (boca-, dependo- and pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus 
[PigSCV]) and the sows (PigSCV, circovirus and ""circovirus-like"" viruses CB-A 
and RW-A). In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of 
sequences present in a sample, was generally higher for the sows as compared to 
the piglets. No consistent differences in the virome composition could be 
identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the 
control group.
CONCLUSION: The analysis indicates that the pig faecal virome shows a high 
variability and that its general composition is mainly dependent on the age of 
the pigs. Changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium E. faecium 
could not be demonstrated using the applied metagenomics method.

Using viral metagenomics we analyzed four bovine serum pools assembled from 715 
calves in the United States. Two parvoviruses, bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) and a 
previously uncharacterized parvovirus designated as bosavirus (BosaV), were 
detected in 3 and 4 pools respectively and their complete coding sequences 
generated. Based on NS1 protein identity, bosavirus qualifies as a member of a 
new species in the copiparvovirus genus. Also detected were low number of reads 
matching ungulate tetraparvovirus 2, bovine hepacivirus, and several 
papillomaviruses. This study further characterizes the diversity of viruses in 
calf serum with the potential to infect fetuses and through fetal bovine serum 
contaminate cell cultures.

frequently observed in relation to VSCC. In contrast to usual-type VIN (uVIN), 
which is related to infection by human papillomavirus (HPV), a germline mutation 
in the p53 gene is thought to be associated with ~90% of dVIN cases. To date, no 
infectious agent has been identified in association with dVIN, and studies 
investigating this possibility have been hindered by the difficulty in 
accurately diagnosing dVIN from small biopsies. Here, we used immunostaining for 
p16ink4a), a biomarker for HPV infection, to study 14 uVIN high-grade VIN and 14 
dVIN cases, and to select 10 dVIN cases to broadly screen for all kn(own viruses 
using a pan-viral microarray platform (ViroChip). All of the uVIN tissue 
samples, including 8 warty and 6 basaloid cases, showed positivity with the 
p16(ink4a) immunostain. The staining pattern was full-thickness for all except 
two cases in which positive staining was localized in the lower 1/3 of the 
epidermis. In contrast, immunostaining for p16(ink4a) was negative in all dVIN 
cases. ViroChip analysis of 10 pure dVIN samples confirmed the absence of human 
papillomavirus subtypes or any other virus with the exception of a single sample 
that showed a weak microarray signature to a porcine herpesvirus. Follow-up PCR 
testing of the sample was negative for herpesvirus, and in-depth metagenomic 
next-generation sequencing revealed only sequences corresponding to 
non-pathogenic viral flora and bacterial contamination. In this study, we 
demonstrated lack of a virus association in 10 dVIN cases. Alternative pathways 
for carcinogenesis such as the p53 mutation should be considered for 
investigation of potential treatment options in dVIN.

Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) strains have been classified into two major 
genotypes (PCV2a and PCV2b) and 8 genetic clusters: PCV2b-1A to PCV2b-1C and 
PCV2a-2A to PCV2a-2E. To date, no studies have been performed to antigenically 
subtype PCV2 strains enclosing eight PCV2 clusters. The present study aimed to 
antigenically subtype PCV2 and perform epitopes' competition analysis using 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Fourteen PCV2 strains representative for eight 
clusters were tested with 20 mAbs (fifteen of them were generated against PCV2a 
strain Stoon-1010 and 5 of them against PCV2b strain 1147) in immunoperoxidase 
monolayer assays. Four mAbs reacted to all 14 PCV2 strains and one mAb reacted 
with all strains except for a PCV2a-2C strain. One mAb reacted with all PCV2a 
strains, except for a PCV2a-2C strain and one mAb reacted with all PCV2b 
strains, except for a PCV2b-1C strain. Nine mAbs reacted with the strains of 
PCV2b-1A/1B, PCV2a-2A and PCV2a-2E. Three mAbs only reacted with the strains of 
PCV2a-2A and PCV2a-2E. One mAb reacted specifically with the strains of 
PCV2b-1A/1B. This suggests that discrete antigenic differences exist between 
different PCV2 genetic clusters and that these clusters can be discriminated by 
the use of a panel of universal and cluster-specific mAbs. Six mAbs were 
selected for cross-competition analysis by a competitive ELISA using PCV2 strain 
Stoon-1010. Six overlapping epitopes were identified on the PCV2 capsid protein. 
The universal mAbs recognized larger epitopes than the cluster-specific mAbs. 
These findings are helpful in the development of diagnostic tests and new 
generation vaccines against PCV2.

Two H9N2 viruses were isolated, for the first time, from humans in Hong Kong in 
1999. Isolation of influenza viruses with a novel subtype of the hemagglutinin 
(HA) drew attention of health care authorities worldwide from the view of 
pandemic preparedness. Sequence analysis of the HA genes reveals that HA of 
A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) is most closely related to that of A/quail/HK/G1/97 
(H9N2) that contains the internal genes similar to those of Hong Kong/97 (H5N1) 
viruses. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses demonstrated the diversity among H9 
HA. A/Hong Kong/1073/99 was shown to cause a respiratory infection in Syrian 
hamsters, suggesting that the virus can replicate efficiently in mammalian 
hosts. We developed a whole virion test vaccine with a formalin-inactivated 
egg-grown HK1073. Intraperitoneal administration of the vaccine twice to 
hamsters conferred a complete protection against challenge infection by the MDCK 
cell-grown homologous virus. Receptor specificity of HK1073 appeared different 
from that of other avian influenza viruses of H9 subtype which recognize 
preferentially alpha-2,3 linked sialic acid. Hemagglutination of HK1073 with 
guinea pig erythrocytes was inhibited by both alpha-2,3 and alpha-2,6 linked 
sialic acid containing polymers. These data suggested that HK1073 had acquired a 
broader host range, including humans. Together with data so far available, the 
present study suggested that isolation of the H9 influenza viruses from humans 
requires precaution against the emergence of a novel human influenza.

"DNA Virome: Sequencing and Data Analysis of Viral Metagenome of Poultry Suffering
from Respiratory Diseases","<jats:p>Respiratory diseases are the most common causes of death in a poultry flock. Knowledge of the
avian respiratory system is essential for developing a health monitoring plan for a poultry flock,
recognizing problems that may occur, and taking action to correct them. Recently, respiratory
diseases in commercial broiler chicken flocks have increased in India and no significant cause has
been identified till date. Viral populations are predominant in respiratory tract infections and they
cause severe economic loss through decreased productivity. We performed shotgun sequencing
approach to understand viruses associated with or causing respiratory infections (RI) in broilers.
We report high quality sequencing reads, de novo assembled sequences, taxonomical as well as

Bunyaviruses are common in male and female<i>Ixodes scapularis</i>ticks in central Pennsylvania,"<jats:p>The blacklegged tick<jats:italic>Ixodes scapularis</jats:italic>is widely distributed in the United States and transmits multiple pathogens to humans, wildlife and domestic animals. Recently, several novel viruses in the family Bunyaviridae (South Bay virus (SBV) and Blacklegged tick phlebovirus (BTPV)) were identified infecting female<jats:italic>I. scapularis</jats:italic>ticks collected in New York State. We used metagenomic sequencing to investigate the distribution of viruses infecting male and female<jats:italic>I. scapularis</jats:italic>ticks collected in Centre County, Pennsylvania. We identified both SBV and BTPV in both male and female ticks from all collection locations. The role of male<jats:italic>I. scapularis</jats:italic>in pathogen epidemiology has been overlooked because they rarely bite and are not considered important pathogen vectors. However, males may act as reservoirs for pathogens that can then be transmitted to females during mating. Our data highlight the importance of examining all potential avenues of pathogen maintenance and transmission throughout the vector-pathogen life cycle in order to understand the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens.</jats:p>",0

The genetic variability of porcine and ruminant pestiviruses was studied by 
comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of 73 isolates (42 porcine and 31 
ruminant), including 65 Japanese isolates (35 porcine and 30 ruminant). The 
5'-untranslated region (UTR) amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) was determined by direct sequencing and phylogenetic analysis 
was performed from the nucleotide sequence data. Most porcine isolates were 
divided into two major subgroups, classical swine fever virus (CSFV) subgroup 1 
(CSFV-1, represented by Brecia strain) and subgroup 2 (CSFV-2, represented by 
Alfort strain). However, the Japanese Kanagawa/74, Okinawa/86, Okinawa/86-2 and 
Thai CBR/93 strains were the most distinct variants and these were assigned to 
another new disparate subgroup, CSFV-3 (represented by p97 strain). Most 
ruminant isolates were classified as the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) 
genotype-I (BVDV-I) and subdivided into two subgroups, BVDV-Ia (represented by 
the NADL strain) and Ib (represented by the Osloss strain). Two bovine isolates 
(MS-1 and SY-89) and a contaminating strain (V/FLL) from an ovine cell line were 
classified as BVDV genotype-II (BVDV-II) on genetic characteristics. These data 
suggested that the detection and phylogenetic analysis of 5'-UTRs are useful for 
the rapid characterization of field isolates.

Antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) are frequently used to enhance weight-gain in 
poultry production. However, there has been increasing concern over the impact 
of AGP on the emergence of antibiotic resistance in zoonotic bacterial pathogens 
in the microbial community of the poultry gut. In this study, we adopted 
mass-spectrophotometric, phylogenetic, and shotgun-metagenomic approaches to 
evaluate bioactive phenolic extracts (BPE) from blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) 
and blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) pomaces as AGP alternatives in broilers. We 
conducted two trials with 100 Cobb-500 broiler chicks (in each trial) in four 
equal groups that were provided water with no supplementation, supplemented with 
AGP (tylosin, neomycin sulfate, bacitracin, erythromycin, and oxytetracycline), 
or supplemented with 0.1 g Gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/L or 1.0 g GAE/L (during 
the last 72 h before euthanasia) of BPE for 6 weeks. When compared with the 
control group (water only), the chickens supplemented with AGP and 0.1 g GAE/L 
of BPE gained 9.5 and 5.8% more body weight, respectively. The microbiomes of 
both the AGP- and BPE-treated chickens had higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes 
ratios. AGP supplementation appeared to be associated with higher relative 
abundance of bacteriophages and unique cecal resistomes compared with BPE 
supplementation or control. Functional characterization of cecal microbiomes 
revealed significant animal-to-animal variation in the relative abundance of 
genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism. These findings established 
a baseline upon which mechanisms of plant-based performance enhancers in 
regulation of animal growth can be investigated. In addition, the data will aid 
in designing alternate strategies to improve animal growth performance and 
consequently production.

Biological and molecular diagnosis of seedborne viruses in cowpea germplasm of geographically diverse sub‐Saharan origins,"<jats:p>A total of 983 cowpea accessions obtained from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) Cowpea Repository were analysed for seedborne viruses. A majority of the accessions originated from 11 countries representing different agroclimatic zones in sub‐Saharan Africa, and included landraces, local cultivars and breeding lines. Following the initial grow‐out tests, 69 cowpea accessions, mostly with symptoms of virus infection, were selected for further evaluation using a combination of host range, reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) and sequence analyses. The analyses revealed that samples from 46 (67%) accessions harboured one or more known seedborne viruses of cowpea. These included seed samples of accessions originating from Botswana (13 accessions), Ghana (6), Nigeria (6), Mali (1), Kenya (5), Cameroon (7), Niger (4), Côte d’lvoire (1), Benin (1), India (1) and China (1). Viruses were identified by RT‐PCR analysis of total RNAs extracted from suspected virus‐infected samples using virus species‐specific primers, as well as the cloning and sequencing of RT‐PCR products amplified using virus genus‐ and family‐specific degenerate oligonucleotide primers. The viruses identified included <jats:italic>Cowpea aphid‐borne mosaic virus</jats:italic> (CABMV), <jats:italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</jats:italic> (CMV) and <jats:italic>Southern bean mosaic virus</jats:italic> (SBMV). Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced coat protein (CP) amino acid sequences of selected CMV isolates recovered from five agroclimatically distinct locations confirmed their affiliations as new members of CMV subgroup IB. This is the first time that seedborne viruses of cowpea accessions in a major collection (UCR) have been identified using RT‐PCR and sequencing approaches.</jats:p>",0

The first notifications of the unknown disease of cattle appeared in 
September-October 2015 in North Caucasus region of Russia (Republic of North 
Ossetia-Alania). The clinical signs included watery discharge from eyes, apathy, 
loss of appetite, salivation, lameness and nodular skin lesions. Capripoxvirus 
genome was detected by real-time PCR in the tissue samples of sick animals. The 
aetiological agent was isolated in the primary cell cultures of lamb testis and 
goat testis, as well as in the continuous MDBK cell culture. Further sequencing 
of the GPCR gene and phylogenetic analysis showed the close genetic relationship 
of isolated capripoxvirus with a group of lumpy skin disease virus. Koch's 
postulates were fulfilled by the experimental infection of four calves with a 
suspension of tissue samples from sick animals.

Many genes important in immunity are found as multigene families. The 
butyrophilin genes are members of the B7 family, playing diverse roles in 
co-regulation and perhaps in antigen presentation. In humans, a fixed number of 
butyrophilin genes are found in and around the major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC), and show striking association with particular autoimmune diseases. In 
chickens, BG genes encode homologues with somewhat different domain 
organisation. Only a few BG genes have been characterised, one involved in 
actin-myosin interaction in the intestinal brush border, and another implicated 
in resistance to viral diseases. We characterise all BG genes in B12 chickens, 
finding a multigene family organised as tandem repeats in the BG region outside 
the MHC, a single gene in the MHC (the BF-BL region), and another single gene on 
a different chromosome. There is a precise cell and tissue expression for each 
gene, but overall there are two kinds, those expressed by haemopoietic cells and 
those expressed in tissues (presumably non-haemopoietic cells), correlating with 
two different kinds of promoters and 5' untranslated regions (5'UTR). However, 
the multigene family in the BG region contains many hybrid genes, suggesting 
recombination and/or deletion as major evolutionary forces. We identify BG genes 
in the chicken whole genome shotgun sequence, as well as by comparison to other 
haplotypes by fibre fluorescence in situ hybridisation, confirming dynamic 
expansion and contraction within the BG region. Thus, the BG genes in chickens 
are undergoing much more rapid evolution compared to their homologues in 
mammals, for reasons yet to be understood.

The pathogenicity and genetic characterizations of six Newcastle disease virus 
(NDV) isolates obtained from chicken farms in six different regions in Iran were 
carried out using conventional and molecular techniques. Based on the 
pathogenicity indices (MDT, ICPI, and IVPI), all of these isolates were found to 
be velogenic (highly virulent) strains. A sequence analysis of the full-length 
mRNA encoding the fusion glycoprotein precursor (F0) of the NDV's fusion 
proteins F1 and F2 in these six isolates showed the presence of point mutations 
in form of nucleic acid substitutions at positions 82((C→T)), 83((T→C)), 
736((A→G)), and 1,633((G→A)). However, the nucleic acid residues at positions 
330-347 of the precursor F0 gene, corresponding to the cleavage site of the F0 
protein, were found to have remained conserved among the six NDV isolates. A 
phylogenetic comparison between the six Iranian isolates and the NDVs whose F0 
gene sequences were previously deposited in GenBank Database showed that all of 
the newly characterized Iranian NDV isolates belonged to genotype VII.

Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a devastating viral disease of cattle which has 
recently spread from Africa into the countries of the Middle East. The aim of 
the present study was to investigate the relationships among lumpy skin disease 
viruses (LSDV) isolated from different regions of Iran and the origin and spread 
of these viruses. In this study, a total of 234 blood samples from clinically 
affected animals from four provinces in the northwest of Iran were screened for 
LSDV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). From 80 positive samples for LSDV 
detected by PCR, the partial P32 gene (759 bp) of 12 isolates were sequenced and 
phylogenetically analyzed. LSD viruses were grouped in three subclusters with an 
overall 97.1-100% nucleotide identity. LSDVs isolated from Gilan showed lowest 
nucleotide identity with the other LSDVs. Four isolates of LSDV including KO-1, 
EA-1, EA-3, and WA-3 showed 100% similarity with each other and also with the 
Neethling strain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the identified LSDVs were 
closely related to each other and had high-sequence homology with other LSDV 
isolates from Africa. It was concluded that LSD outbreak probably occurred in 
the northwest of Iran by LSDVs entering the country from Iraq and P32 nucleotide 
sequence information obtained in the present study is a valuable resource in 
understanding the genetic nature and molecular epidemiology of local LSDV 
isolates which can be used for future vaccine development based on the 
circulating strains in the region.

A Four-Biomarker Blood Signature Discriminates Systemic Inflammation Due to Viral Infection Versus Other Etiologies,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The innate immune system of humans and other mammals responds to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are conserved across broad classes of infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses. We hypothesized that a blood-based transcriptional signature could be discovered indicating a host systemic response to viral infection. Previous work identified host transcriptional signatures to individual viruses including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and dengue, but the generality of these signatures across all viral infection types has not been established. Based on 44 publicly available datasets and two clinical studies of our own design, we discovered and validated a four-gene expression signature in whole blood, indicative of a general host systemic response to many types of viral infection. The signature’s genes are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (<jats:italic>ISG15</jats:italic>), Interleukin 16 (<jats:italic>IL16</jats:italic>), 2′,5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (<jats:italic>OASL</jats:italic>), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (<jats:italic>ADGRE5</jats:italic>). In each of 13 validation datasets encompassing human, macaque, chimpanzee, pig, mouse, rat and all seven Baltimore virus classification groups, the signature provides statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) discrimination between viral and non-viral conditions. The signature may have clinical utility for differentiating host systemic inflammation (SI) due to viral versus bacterial or non-infectious causes.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: Avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) consist of nine known serotypes. The 
genomes of representatives of all APMV serotypes except APMV type 5 have 
recently been fully sequenced. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of 
the APMV-5 prototype strain budgerigar/Kunitachi/74.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: APMV-5 Kunitachi virus is unusual in that it 
lacks a virion hemagglutinin and does not grow in the allantoic cavity of 
embryonated chicken eggs. However, the virus grew in the amniotic cavity of 
embryonated chicken eggs and in twelve different established cell lines and two 
primary cell cultures. The genome is 17,262 nucleotides (nt) long, which is the 
longest among members of genus Avulavirus, and encodes six non-overlapping genes 
in the order of 3'N-P/V/W-M-F-HN-L-5' with intergenic regions of 4-57 nt. The 
genome length follows the 'rule of six' and contains a 55-nt leader sequence at 
the 3'end and a 552 nt trailer sequence at the 5' end. The phosphoprotein (P) 
gene contains a conserved RNA editing site and is predicted to encode P, V, and 
W proteins. The cleavage site of the F protein (G-K-R-K-K-R downward arrowF) 
conforms to the cleavage site motif of the ubiquitous cellular protease furin. 
Consistent with this, exogenous protease was not required for virus replication 
in vitro. However, the intracerebral pathogenicity index of APMV-5 strain 
Kunitachi in one-day-old chicks was found to be zero, indicating that the virus 
is avirulent for chickens despite the presence of a polybasic F cleavage site.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the APVM-5 
genome and proteins versus those of the other APMV serotypes showed that APMV-5 
is more closely related to APMV-6 than to the other APMVs. Furthermore, these 
comparisons provided evidence of extensive genome-wide divergence that supports 
the classification of the APMVs into nine separate serotypes. The structure of 
the F cleavage site does not appear to be a reliable indicator of virulence 
among APMV serotypes 2-9. The availability of sequence information for all known 
APMV serotypes will facilitate studies in epidemiology and vaccinology.

The geographic distribution of arboviruses has received considerable attention 
after several dramatic emergence events around the world. Bluetongue virus (BTV) 
is classified among category ""A"" diseases notifiable to the World Organization 
of Animal Health (OIE), and is transmitted among ruminants by biting midges of 
the genus Culicoides. Here, we developed a comprehensive occurrence data set to 
map the current distribution, estimate the ecological niche, and explore the 
future potential distribution of BTV globally using ecological niche modeling 
and based on diverse future climate scenarios from general circulation models 
(GCMs) for four representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The broad 
ecological niche and potential geographic distribution of BTV under present-day 
conditions reflected the disease's current distribution across the world in 
tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. All model predictions were 
significantly better than random expectations. As a further evaluation of model 
robustness, we compared our model predictions to 331 independent records from 
most recent outbreaks from the Food and Agriculture Organization Emergency 
Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases 
Information System (EMPRES-i); all were successfully anticipated by the BTV 
model. Finally, we tested ecological niche similarity among possible vectors and 
BTV, and could not reject hypotheses of niche similarity. Under future-climate 
conditions, the potential distribution of BTV was predicted to broaden, 
especially in central Africa, United States, and western Russia.

The antigenic homology of 26 coronavirus isolates, of which 22 were 
antigenically related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was 
determined with 42 monoclonal antibodies. Type, group, and interspecies specific 
epitopes were defined. Two group specific MAbs distinguished the enteric TGEV 
isolates from the respiratory variants. An antigenic subsite involved in 
neutralization was conserved in porcine, feline, and canine coronavirus. The 
classification of the human coronavirus 229E in a taxonomic cluster distinct 
from TGEV group is suggested.

Neuraminidase (NA) is an envelope glycoprotein of influenza viruses, including 
swine-lineage influenza A viruses. NA possesses sialidase activity, which is 
functionally important at multiple points in viral replication, 
counter-balancing the sialic acid receptor binding activity of the hemagglutinin 
(HA), the other major envelope glycoprotein. The NA proteins of influenza A 
viruses have been classified into nine serological subtypes, and they undergo 
antigenic drift variation similar to that of HA. Antibodies to NA are analyzed 
much less often than antibodies to HA. The conventional assay for NA inhibition 
(NI) antibody titration, established decades ago, is widely considered unwieldy 
and inefficient for routine use. In recent years, a few new formats have been 
developed which still measure inhibition of NA enzymatic function, but more 
efficiently and with less chemical waste produced. Described here is the 
enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA), which is performed in 96-well plates and 
analyzed on a spectrophotometric plate reader. An important factor in adoption 
of the ELLA technique for animal studies, such as swine, is the choice of NA 
antigen, which may be purified protein or whole virus containing an 
antigenically irrelevant HA protein. This NI assay, in conjunction with the 
hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibody assay, offers a practical way to 
characterize viral isolates more fully and to quantify antibodies induced by 
infection or vaccination.

Recent developments in molecular biology shed light on cross-species 
transmission of SPPV and GTPV. The present study was planned to characterize the 
capripoxviruses which were circulating in the field condition among sheep and 
goats using RPO30 gene-based viral lineage (SPPV/GTPV) differentiating PCR and 
sequencing of RPO30 and GPCR genes from clinical samples. Out of 58 scabs (35 
sheep and 23 goats) screened, 27 sheep and 18 goat scabs were found positive for 
capripox virus infections. With the exception of one sheep and one goat scabs, 
all the positive samples yielded amplicon size according to host origin, i.e. 
SPPV in sheep and GTPV in goats. In the above two exceptional cases, goat scab 
and sheep scab yielded amplicon size as that of SPPV and GTPV, respectively. 
Further, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of complete ORFs of RPO30 and GPCR 
genes from six sheep and three goat scabs revealed that with the exception of 
above two samples, all had host-specific signatures and clustered according to 
their host origin. In case of cross-species infecting samples, sheep scab 
possessed GTPV-like signatures and goat scab possessed SPPV-like signatures. Our 
study identifies the circulation of cross-infecting SPPV and GTPV in the field 
and warrants the development of single-strain vaccine which can protect the 
animals from both sheeppox and goatpox diseases.

Maedi-visna virus (MVV) and caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) are 
related members of a group of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) that infect 
sheep and goats. SRLVs are endemic in many countries, including Canada. However, 
very little is known about the genetic characteristics of Canadian SRLVs, 
particularly in the province of Ontario. Given the importance of surveillance 
and eradication programs for the control of SRLVs, it is imperative that the 
diagnostic tests used to identify infected animals are sensitive to local 
strains of SRLVs. The aim of this work was to characterize SRLV strains 
circulating in Ontario and to evaluate the variability of the immunodominant 
regions of the Gag protein. In this study, the nearly complete gag sequence of 
164 SRLVs, from 130 naturally infected sheep and 32 naturally infected goats 
from Ontario, was sequenced. Animals belonged to distantly located single and 
mixed species (sheep and goats) farms. Ovine lentiviruses from the same farm 
tended to cluster more closely together than did caprine lentiviruses from the 
same farm. Sequence analysis revealed a higher degree of heterogeneity among the 
caprine lentivirus sequences with an average inter-farm pairwise DNA distance of 
10% and only 5% in the ovine lentivirus group. Interestingly, amplification of 
SRLVs from ELISA positive sheep was successful in 81% of cases, whereas 
amplification of SRLV proviral DNA was only possible in 55% of the ELISA 
positive goat samples; suggesting that a significant portion of caprine 
lentiviruses circulating in Ontario possess heterogeneity at the primer binding 
sites used in this study. Sequences of sheep and goat SRLVs from Ontario were 
assembled into phylogenetic trees with other known SRLVs and were found to 
belong to sequence groups A2 and B1, respectively, as defined by Shah et al. 
(2004a). A novel caprine lentivirus with a pairwise genetic difference of 
15.6-25.4% relative to other group B subtypes was identified. Thus we suggest 
the designation of a novel subtype, B4, within the caprine lentivirus-like 
cluster. Lastly, we demonstrate evidence of recombination between ovine 
lentiviruses. These results emphasize the broad genetic diversity of SRLV 
strains circulating in the province of Ontario and show that the gag region is 
suitable for phylogenetic studies and may be applied to monitor SRLV eradication 
programs.

Group A rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhoea in humans, especially in young 
children. Bats also harbour group A rotaviruses, but the genetic backgrounds of 
bat rotavirus strains are usually distinct from those of human rotavirus 
strains. We identified a new strain of group A rotavirus in the intestinal 
contents of a horseshoe bat in Zambia. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the 
identified virus, named RVA/Bat-wt/ZMB/LUS12-14/2012/G3P[3], possessed the 
genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I3-R2-C2-M3-A9-N2-T3-E2-H3. Several genome 
segments of LUS12-14 were highly similar to those of group A rotaviruses 
identified from humans, cows and antelopes, indicating interspecies transmission 
of rotaviruses between bats and other mammals with possible multiple genomic 
reassortment events.

            During a study of the fecal microbiomes from two healthy piglets using high-throughput sequencing (HTS), we identified a viral genome containing an open reading frame encoding a predicted polyprotein of 2,133 amino acids. This novel viral genome displayed the typical organization of picornaviruses, containing three structural proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1), followed by seven nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C

Fecal samples collected at an industrial farm from healthy sows and piglets from the same herd (25 and 75, respectively) with ages ranging from 4 to 28 weeks were analyzed for the presence of SPaV1 by one-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR targeting a 3D region of 151 bp. SPaV1 was detected in fecal samples from 51/75 healthy piglets (68% of the animals) and in none of the 25 fecal samples from healthy sows, indicating that SPaV1 circulates through enteric infection of healthy piglets.

H2N2 influenza A viruses caused the Asian pandemic of 1957 and then disappeared 
from the human population 10 years later. To assess the potential for similar 
outbreaks in the future, we determined the antigenicity of H2 hemagglutinins 
(HAs) from representative human and avian H2 viruses and then analyzed the 
nucleotide and amino acid sequences to determine their evolutionary 
characteristics in different hosts. The results of longitudinal virus 
surveillance studies were also examined to estimate the prevalence of avian H2 
isolates among samples collected from wild ducks and domestic poultry. 
Reactivity patterns obtained with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies 
indicated antigenic drift in the HA of human H2 influenza viruses, beginning in 
1962. Amino acid changes were clustered in two regions of HA1 that correspond to 
antigenic sites A and D of the H3 HA. By contrast, the antigenic profiles of the 
majority of avian H2 HAs were remarkably conserved through 1991, resembling the 
prototype Japan 57 (H2N2) strain. Amino acid changes were distributed throughout 
HA1, indicating that antibodies do not play a major role in the selection of 
avian H2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two geographic site-specific 
lineages of avian H2 HAs: North American and Eurasian. Evidence is presented to 
support interregion transmission of gull H2 viruses. The human H2 HAs that 
circulated in 1957-1968 form a separate phylogenetic lineage, most closely 
related to the Eurasian avian H2 HAs. There was an increased prevalence of H2 
influenza viruses among wild ducks in 1988 in North America, preceding the 
appearance of H2N2 viruses in domestic fowl. As the prevalence of avian H2N2 
influenza viruses increased on turkey farms and in live bird markets in New York 
City and elsewhere, greater numbers of these viruses have come into direct 
contact with susceptible humans. We conclude that antigenically conserved 
counterparts of the human Asian pandemic strain of 1957 continue to circulate in 
the avian reservoir and are coming into closer proximity to susceptible human 
populations.

Single major polypeptide of a calicivirus: characterization by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stabilization of virions by cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate,"<jats:p>A calicivirus, San Miguel sea lion virus serotype 4, isolate 15FT, externally labelled with 125I, was shown by gel electrophoresis to possess a single major polypeptide. The polypeptide migrated anomalously upon electrophoresis in two sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) systems: more slowly than bovine serum albumin in a continuous phosphate-buffered system and more rapidly than bovine serum albumin in a discontinuous system. Estimated molecular weights in the two systems were approximately 71,000 and 64,000, respectively. There was no clear evidence for a minor virion polypeptide. Treatment of purified San Miguel sea lion virions with dimethyl suberimidate, a cross-linking reagent, preserved virion integrity during long-term storage at 4 degrees C. Oligomeric species of the polypeptide were observed upon electrophoresis of products from cross-linked virions. Based upon a preferred polypeptide molecular weight estimate of 71,000 and distribution of oligomeric species, a calicivirion model with 120 monomeric protein units is proposed as an alternative to a 180-unit model.</jats:p>",0

Bubaline alphaherpesvirus 1 (BuHV1) is a member of the family Herpesviridae, 
subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, genus Varicellovirus. To date, no full genome 
sequence of BuHV has been published. Here, we report the complete genome 
sequence of bubaline alphaherpesvirus 1 (BuHV1) strain b6 (BuHV1-b6), isolated 
from a water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in 1972 in Australia. The virus was 
multiplied in MDBK cells, and the DNA was extracted and subjected to 
high-throughput sequencing. The reads were aligned and combined into a single 
genome sequence, with bovine alphaherpesvirus 5 (BoHV5) strain SV507/99 
(accession number NC005261) as a reference. The BuHV1-b6 genome is a linear 
double-stranded DNA molecule, 137,452 bp long, with a GC content of 76.8%. The 
genome consists of two unique sequences: a long, or UL, sequence (103,818 bp) 
and a short, or US, sequence (9,586 bp), with the latter being flanked by 
inverted IR and TR elements of 12,024 bp each. The arrangement is typical of 
herpesvirus genomes of the D-type. The overall sequence has a 92.2% similarity 
at the nucleotide level to the reference BoHV5 strain. Our report provides a 
significant landmark in the history of herpesviruses, represented by the genome 
sequence of this 44-year-old virus isolate.

Comparisons of Venezuelan encephalitis virus strains by hemagglutination-inhibition tests with chicken antibodies,"<jats:p>Twenty strains of Venezuelan encephalitis (VE) virus inoculated intravenously in large doses into roosters produced hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies detectable in plasmas within 7 to 10 days. No signs of illness occurred, and there was no evidence of viral growth in tissues since blood concentrations of infectious virus steadily decreased after inoculation. HI antibodies in early plasmas were specific for VE virus and did not cross-react significantly with two other North American alphaviruses, eastern and western encephalitis viruses. VE virus strains could be distinquished by virus-dilution, short-incubation HI, but not by plasma-dilution neutralization tests, by using early rooster antibodies. The distinctions by HI test were similar with some strains to, but different with other strains from, those described by Young and Johnson with the spiny rat antisera used to establish their subtype classifications of VE virus (14, 28). Nevertheless, results of HI tests with rooster antibodies correlated with equine virulence, as did results with spiny rat antibodies, and distinguished the new strains of virus that appeared in Middle America during the VE outbreak of 1969 from preexisting strains.</jats:p>",0
"Prevalence of Porcine Noroviruses, Molecular Characterization of Emerging Porcine Sapoviruses from Finisher Swine in the United States, and Unified Classification Scheme for Sapoviruses","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Noroviruses (NoVs) and sapoviruses (SaVs) are important human pathogens. Although the involvement of porcine NoVs in disease in pigs is unclear, they are genetically and antigenically closely related to human NoVs. Human NoV-like strains have been detected in pigs, raising public health concerns of potential interspecies transmission. Porcine SaVs are highly diverse and emerging in swine populations. Recently, at least three new genogroups of porcine SaVs have been proposed. In this study, we tested 413 pooled fecal samples collected from apparently healthy finisher pigs in North Carolina swine farms during 2009. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR coupled hybridization assays were performed to detect known porcine NoVs. The overall prevalence of porcine NoVs determined was 18.9% based on this method. Samples were then tested by RT-PCR targeting the 5′ end of the capsid region for genogroup II (GII) NoVs, a group which includes human NoVs, followed by sequence analysis. All NoVs identified belonged to typical porcine NoV genotypes, and no human NoV-like strains were detected in specimens from these pigs. Porcine NoV-negative samples (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 335) were subsequently screened using universal calicivirus primers, and 17 SaV strains were confirmed by sequencing. Based on the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, they clustered with GIII, GVII, and GVIII and with currently unclassified SaVs. According to analysis of the complete capsid sequences, 7 representative strains clustered with GVII, GVIII, and GIX? SaVs. We tentatively classified SaVs into 14 genogroups based on the complete capsid protein VP1. In summary, porcine NoVs and highly divergent SaVs were present in North Carolina finisher pigs.

Genomes of newly isolated Salmonella phages were analysed by comparison of their 
EcoRI restriction patterns and by hybridization. Characteristic hybridization 
probes from reference phages P22, ES18 and E. coli phage lambda were chosen. 
Four probes selected from the lysis region examined the dispersal of the 
lambdoid lysis genes. Other probes characterized were the replication genes and 
part of the structural genes. The complex immunity region was investigated by 
means of hybridization as well as biological tests. The results showed the 
relationship of the isolated phages to the P22 branch of the lambdoid phages and 
revealed their modular genome organization consisting of different proportions 
of P22-related sequences. DNA restriction patterns of phages released from 
Salmonella strains sampled in limited geographical areas were significantly less 
heterogeneous than those of phages released from the worldwide sampled SARA 
collection. The use of prophage restriction patterns as a tool for the typing of 
Salmonellae to support the epidemiologic classification of pathogenic strains is 
discussed.

Universität Witten/Herdecke, Cologne, Germany.

The human bocavirus (HBoV) was initially discovered in 2005 as the second 
pathogenic member of the parvovirus family, next to the human parvovirus B19. 
HBoV has since been shown to be extremely common worldwide and to cause a 
systemic infection in small children often resulting in respiratory disease. 
Three more, presumably enteric, human bocaviruses (HBoV2-4) have been identified 
in stool samples. Parvoviruses are assumed to replicate via their genomic 
terminal hairpin-like structures in a so-called 'rolling-hairpin model'. These 
terminal sequences have recently been partially identified in head-to-tail 
HBoV-PCR amplicons from clinical samples, and are most likely hybrid relics of 
HBoV's predecessors, namely bovine parvovirus 1 on the left-hand side and minute 
virus of canines on the right, shown for the first time in this article. 
Thereby, the replication model postulated for HBoV remains questionable as the 
occurrence of head-to-tail sequences is not a typical feature of the 
rolling-hairpin replication model. However, such episomes can also be persistent 
storage forms of the genome.

BACKGROUND: Currently, eight species in four genera of parvovirus have been 
described that infect swine. These include ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (classical 
porcine parvovirus, PPV), ungulate tetraparvovirus 2 (PPV3), ungulate 
tetraparvovirus 3 (which includes PPV2, porcine hokovirus, porcine partetravirus 
and porcine PARV4), ungulate copiparvovirus 2 (which includes PPV4 and PPV5), 
ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (which includes porcine bocavirus 1, 2 and 6), 
ungulate bocaparvovirus 3 (porcine bocavirus 5), ungulate bocaparvovirus 4 
(porcine bocavirus 7) and ungulate bocaparvovirus 5 (porcine bocavirus 3, 4-1 
and 4-2). PPV6, the most recently described porcine parvovirus, was first 
identified in China in late 2014 in aborted pig fetuses. Prevalence of PPV6 in 
China was found to be similar in finishing age pigs from farms with and without 
evidence of swine reproductive failure.
METHODS: Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) was detected by sequence-independent single 
primer amplification (SISPA) and confirmed by overlapping and real-time PCR in 
the serum of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSv) positive 
samples.
RESULTS: Seven nearly complete genomes of PPV6 were identified in PRRSv genotype 
2 positive serum samples submitted to state veterinary diagnostic laboratories 
in 2014. Further testing using overlapping and real-time PCR determined PPV6 to 
be present in 13.2 % of the serums tested. Additionally, PPV6 was present in 
samples from all of the geographic locations sampled encompassing nine states in 
the United States and one state in Mexico. The presence of PPV6 in serum 
indicates that the PPV6 infection is disseminated and not localized to a 
specific tissue type. Alignments of the near full length genomes, NS1, and 
capsid genes identified one of the five PPV6 isolates from China (98.6-99.5 % 
identity with the North American strains) to be the North American strains 
nearest relative.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to report the presence of PPV6 in North 
America and demonstrate that the virus is found in multiple geographic areas in 
the United States and in Mexico. The overall prevalence of PPV6 in PRRSv viremic 
animals is relatively low. Further, all of the PPV6 genomes found in North 
America are most closely related to a PPV6 strain first identified in 2014 in 
healthy pigs from the Tianjin province of China.

Encephalitis can be caused by several infectious agents, including bacteria, 
fungi, parasites and viruses. In many cases, the causative agent cannot be 
identified, because the pathogens are unknown or detection methods are not 
routinely available. In our case, a 15-month-old cow developed central nervous 
disorders and died within 6 days after the onset of clinical signs. The 
histopathology revealed an acute encephalitis, predominantly in the brain stem, 
and a ganglionitis of the trigeminal ganglion with massive neuronal necroses in 
both the brain and the ganglion. However, a relevant panel of bacterial and 
viral infections of cattle could be routinely excluded. Therefore, a brain 
sample from the cow was analysed using a metagenomics approach with 
next-generation sequencing. A novel bovine astrovirus (BoAstV-BH89/14) could be 
identified using the analysis pipeline RIEMS, and the finding could be confirmed 
with a specific BoAstV RT-qPCR. The genome of the bovine astrovirus (BoAstV), 
belonging to the family Astroviridae in the genus Mamastrovirus, has a length of 
6478 bp. Sequence identities between 71% to a sheep astrovirus and 69% to two 
recently described bovine astroviruses from the USA and Switzerland were 
ascertained. The latter were also connected to encephalitis cases in cattle. 
Like these, the new virus described here was detected in different brain 
sections using the specific BoAstV RT-qPCR and fluorescent in situ 
hybridization. In conclusion, while astroviruses so far were mainly found in 
relation to gastroenteritis in animals and humans, recently detected astrovirus 
infections were also related to encephalitis.

During the last years, genetic information of hepaciviruses (family 
Flaviviridae), whose type species is the human hepatitis C virus, was detected 
in a wide range of primates and non-primate vertebrates. Here, samples collected 
from 263 German cattle kept in 22 different holdings were analysed for the 
presence of hepacivirus N (syn. bovine hepacivirus; BovHepV). One hundred 
eighty-six cattle that suffered from unspecific clinical signs such as fever and 
a reduced milk yield as well as 77 apparently healthy animals were included. A 
total of 39 cattle (14.8%) tested positive for BovHepV by real-time RT-PCR, but 
a correlation between clinical signs and virus infection could not be found. 
From 31 of the virus-positive samples, sequences of the NS3 coding region were 
generated and from two samples, viral sequences of the complete coding region 
were produced and compared to further European and African BovHepV sequences. 
Based on the NS3 genomic region, two distinct German BovHepV clusters were 
identified which differed between each other up to 20% at the nucleotide level, 
the diversity within the individual clusters reached up to 10%. Based on the 
full-length sequences, the newly detected virus variants group together with 
further German and African viruses in a sister relationship to other 
hepaciviruses from primates and further mammalians, but form distinct clusters 
within the BovHepV branch. In conclusion, highly diverse hepaciviruses were 
detected in German cattle further expanding the known phylogenetic diversity of 
the genus Hepacivirus.

Molecular evolution of influenza viruses.

Scholtissek C(1).

Author information:

There are two different mechanisms by which influenza viruses might evolve: (1) 
Because the RNA genome of influenza viruses is segmented, new strains can 
suddenly be produced by reassortment, as happens, for example, during antigenic 
shift, creating new pandemic strains. (2) New viruses evolve relatively slowly 
by stepwise mutation and selection, for example, during antigenic or genetic 
drift. Influenza A viruses were found in various vertebrate species, where they 
form reservoirs that do not easily mix. While human influenza A viruses do not 
spread in birds and vice versa, the species barrier to pigs is relatively low, 
so that pigs might function as ""mixing vessels"" for the creation of new pandemic 
reassortants in Southeast Asia, where the probability is greatest for double 
infection of pigs by human and avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic studies 
revealed that about 100 years ago, an avian influenza A virus had crossed the 
species barrier, presumably first to pigs, and from there to humans, forming the 
new stable human and classical swine lineages. In 1979, again, an avian virus 
showed up in the North European swine population, forming another stable swine 
lineage. The North European swine isolates from 1979 until about 1985 were 
genetically extremely unstable. A hypothesis is put forward stating that a 
mutator mutation is necessary to enable influenza virus to cross the species 
barrier by providing the new host with sufficient variants from which it can 
select the best fitting ones. As long as the mutator mutation is still present, 
such a virus should be able to cross the species barrier a second time, as 
happened about 100 years ago. Although the most recent swine isolates from 
northern Germany are again genetically stable, we nevertheless should be on the 
lookout to see if a North European swine virus shows up in the human population 
in the near future.

            <jats:italic>Tupaia</jats:italic>
            spp. (tree shrew) was determined. Tree shrews are taxonomically assumed to be at the base of the phylogenetic tree of mammals and are frequently used as laboratory animals in neurological and behavior research. The TAV genome is 33,501 bp in length with a G+C content of 49.96% and has 166-bp inverted terminal repeats. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence resulted in the identification of 109 open reading frames (ORFs) with a coding capacity of at least 40 amino acid residues. Thirty-eight of them are predicted to encode viral proteins based on the presence of transcription and translation signals and sequence and positional conservation. Thirty viral ORFs were found to show significant similarities to known adenoviral genes, arranged into discrete early and late genome regions as they are known from mastadenoviruses. Analysis of the nucleotide content of the TAV genome revealed a significant CG dinucleotide depletion at the genome ends that suggests methylation of these genomic regions during the viral life cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral gene products, including penton and hexon proteins, viral protease, terminal protein, protein VIII, DNA polymerase, protein IVa2, and 100,000-molecular-weight protein, revealed that the evolutionary lineage of TAV forms a separate branch within the phylogenetic tree of the

Pathogen surveillance in animals does not provide a sufficient level of 
vigilance because it is generally confined to surveillance of pathogens with 
known economic impact in domestic animals and practically nonexistent in 
wildlife species. As most (re-)emerging viral infections originate from animal 
sources, it is important to obtain insight into viral pathogens present in the 
wildlife reservoir from a public health perspective. When monitoring living, 
free-ranging wildlife for viruses, sample collection can be challenging and 
availability of nucleic acids isolated from samples is often limited. The 
development of viral metagenomics platforms allows a more comprehensive 
inventory of viruses present in wildlife. We report a metagenomic viral survey 
of the Western Arctic herd of barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) 
in Alaska, USA. The presence of mammalian viruses in eye and nose swabs of 39 
free-ranging caribou was investigated by random amplification combined with a 
metagenomic analysis approach that applied exhaustive iterative assembly of 
sequencing results to define taxonomic units of each metagenome. Through 
homology search methods we identified the presence of several mammalian viruses, 
including different papillomaviruses, a novel parvovirus, polyomavirus, and a 
virus that potentially represents a member of a novel genus in the family 
Coronaviridae.

Among enteric caliciviruses, noroviruses belong to the genus Norovirus, one of 
the four accepted genera in the family Caliciviridae. These single-stranded, 
positive-sense RNA viruses are highly variable both genetically and 
antigenically. Several animal enteric caliciviruses that are morphologically 
indistinguishable and genetically closely related to human noroviruses have been 
identified. The first bovine enteric noroviruses were described in Great Britain 
and are known as Newbury Agent 2. At least three genetic clusters of porcine 
noroviruses join together within genogroup II noroviruses. Human noroviruses are 
the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis illness in people of all ages. 
In the USA, they are associated with approximately 30-50% of all food-borne 
outbreaks. Until now, noroviruses have not been associated with gastroenteritis 
outbreaks in immunocompetent animals. Neither bovine nor porcine noroviruses can 
replicate in cell culture, although human norovirus can grow in a complex 3D 
culture system. However, the recently discovered murine noroviruses can 
replicate in cell culture and are therefore used as model viruses to study human 
noroviruses. This review focusses on virus classification, virion structure, 
pathogenesis, epidemiology, immune response and diagnosis of animal noroviruses 
in comparison with human noroviruses. The classification of animal enteric 
caliciviruses within the Norovirus genus raises the question of whether 
transmission from an animal reservoir to humans could occur. Answering this 
question is important in determining the risk of cross-species infections 
affecting the epidemiology and evolution of these viruses and so complicating 
the control of human norovirus infections.

Highly virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates are List A pathogens for 
commercial poultry, and reports of their isolation among member nations must be 
made to the Office of International Epizootes (OIE). The virus is classified as 
a member of the order Mononegavirales in the family Paramyxoviridae of the 
subfamily Paramyxovirinae. Two interactive surface glycoproteins, the fusion (F) 
and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins, play essential roles in NDV 
attachment and fusion of cells during infection. Antibodies to the F or HN 
proteins are capable of virus neutralization; however, no full-length sequences 
are available for these genes from recently obtained virulent isolates. 
Therefore, nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the F and HN protein 
genes from 16 NDV isolates representing highly virulent viruses from worldwide 
sources were obtained for comparison to older virulent isolates and vaccine 
strains. The F protein amino acid sequence was relatively conserved among 
isolates maintaining potential glycosylation sites and C residues for disulfide 
bonds. A dibasic amino acid motif was present at the cleavage site among more 
virulent isolates, while the low virulence viruses did not have this sequence. 
However, a Eurasian collared dove virus had a K114Q substitution at the F 
cleavage site unique among NDV isolates. The HN protein among NDV isolates 
maintained predicted catalytic and active site residues necessary for 
neuraminidase activity and hemagglutination. Length of the HN for the Eurasian 
collared dove isolate and a previously reported heat resistant virulent isolate 
were longer relative to other more recent virulent isolates. Phylogenetically 
NDV isolates separated into four groups with more recent virulent isolates 
forming a diverse branch, while all the avian paramyxoviruses formed their own 
clade distinct from other members of the Paramyxoviridae.

Six commercially available monovalent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) 
live-vaccines were examined for their biological and genomic stability in 
comparison to their stated parent virus. Thermostability of the hemagglutinin at 
56 degrees C for 5 min was consistently observed among the majority of the 
vaccine viruses. One exception was a recently developed NDV vaccine isolated 
from turkeys that had a thermostability of 15 min. Neuraminidase activity, as 
measured by elution rate of agglutinated red blood cells, varied among vaccine 
viruses and correlated with that of the parent isolate. Virulence as measured by 
intracerebral pathogenicity index ranged from 0 to 0.39 among NDV vaccine-type 
viruses, well within the range of avirulent lentogens. Sequence of the fusion 
protein cleavage site from all the NDV vaccine isolates examined was consistent 
with that for lentogens. The entire hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene sequence 
was 98% similar among all the NDV vaccine viruses examined and phylogenetic 
classification of commercial vaccine types correlated with their respective 
parent virus. Consequently, the commercially produced NDV vaccines reported here 
appear relatively stable when mass produced in avian embryonated eggs.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is classified as a member of the superfamily 
Mononegavirales in the family Paramyxoviridae. This virus family is divided into 
two subfamilies, the Paramyxovirinae and the Pneumovirinae. In 1993 the 
International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses rearranged the order of the 
Paramyxovirus genus and placed NDV within the Rubulavirus genus among the 
Paramyxovirinae. The enveloped virus has a negative sense single-stranded RNA 
genome of 15,186 kb which codes for an RNA directed RNA polymerase, 
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein, fusion protein, matrix protein, 
phosphoprotein and nucleoprotein in the 5' to 3' direction. The virus has a wide 
host range with most orders of birds reported to have been infected by NDV. 
Isolates are characterized by virulence in chickens and are categorized into 
three main pathotypes depending on severity of disease. Lentogenic isolates are 
of low virulence while viruses of intermediate virulence are termed mesogenic. 
Highly virulent viruses that cause high mortality in birds are termed 
neurotropic or viscerotropic velogenic. Velogenic NDV are List A pathogens that 
require reporting to the Office of International Epizootics and outbreaks result 
in strict trade embargoes. The primary molecular determinant for NDV 
pathogenicity is the fusion protein cleavage site amino acid sequence. 
Vaccination for NDV is primarily by mass application of live-virus vaccines 
among commercial poultry. Although protection is measured by presence of 
antibodies to NDV, vaccinated B-cell depleted chickens are resistant to disease. 
Consequently, immune protection involves responses that are presently 
incompletely defined.

Avian pneumovirus (APV) was first isolated from turkeys in the west-central US 
following emergence of turkey rhinotracheitis (TRT) during 1996. Subsequently, 
several APV isolates were obtained from the north-central US. Matrix (M) and 
fusion (F) protein genes of these isolates were examined for sequence 
heterogeneity and compared with European APV subtypes A and B. Among US isolates 
the M gene shared greater than 98% nucleotide sequence identity with only one 
nonsynonymous change occurring in a single US isolate. Although the F gene among 
US APV isolates shared 98% nucleotide sequence identity, nine conserved 
substitutions were detected in the predicted amino acid sequence. The predicted 
amino acid sequence of the US APV isolate's F protein had 72% sequence identity 
to the F protein of APV subtype A and 71% sequence identity to the F protein of 
APV subtype B. This compares with 83% sequence identity between the APV subtype 
A and B predicted amino acid sequences of the F protein. The US isolates were 
phylogenetically distinguishable from their European counterparts based on F 
gene nucleotide or predicted amino acid sequences. Lack of sequence 
heterogeneity among US APV subtypes indicates these viruses have maintained a 
relatively stable population since the first outbreak of TRT. Phylogenetic 
analysis of the F protein among APV isolates supports classification of US 
isolates as a new APV subtype C.

Avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1), also referred to as Newcastle disease virus 
(NDV), variants of low virulence were isolated from chickens, ducks and other 
unidentified species found in live-bird markets of the northeastern United 
States. These isolates were characterized as APMV-1 by the 
hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay utilizing NDV-specific polyclonal 
antisera. However, the isolates failed to react with a monoclonal antibody that 
has specificity for a wide variety of APMV-1 isolates. Although only highly 
virulent isolates require reporting to international regulatory agencies, the 
ability to correctly identify APMV-1 types is important for control and 
regulatory purposes. Protein gel patterns of the purified isolates resembled 
previously reported APMV-1 and anti-NDV polyclonal sera recognized the viral 
proteins. For three isolates oligonucleotide primers specific for the 
nucleoprotein, fusion protein and polymerase genes of NDV were utilized to 
synthesize cDNA using viral RNA as a template. Approximately 12kb of the genome 
was subsequently sequenced for the three isolates that included the 
nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, fusion (F) protein, 
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein genes and a 5' portion of the polymerase 
gene. The isolates had an F protein cleavage site sequence of ERQER/LVG 
indicating low-virulence viruses that phylogenetically separated with other 
unique NDV isolates designated as a lineage 6 genotype. Additionally, a four 
amino acid insert was detected in the predicted phosphoprotein which complies 
with the ""rule of six"" among paramyxoviruses. These APMV-1 genotypes have not 
been previously reported in North America and further substantiate the 
heterogeneous genetic nature of these commercially important pathogens found 
worldwide.

Bat rabies is an emerging disease of public health significance in the Americas. 
The Caribbean island of Trinidad experiences periodic outbreaks within the 
livestock population. We performed molecular characterisation of Trinidad rabies 
virus (RABV) and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to investigate the 
extent to which outbreaks are a result of in situ evolution versus importation 
of virus from the nearby South American mainland. Trinidadian RABV sequences 
were confirmed as bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) 
related sequences. They fell into two largely temporally defined lineages 
designated Trinidad I and II. The Trinidad I lineage which included sequences 
from 1997-2000 (all but two of which were from the northeast of the island) was 
most closely related to RABV from Ecuador (2005, 2007), French Guiana (1990) and 
Venezuela (1993, 1994). Trinidad II comprised sequences from the southwest of 
the island, which clustered into two groups: Trinidad IIa, which included one 
sequence each from 2000 and 2007, and Trinidad IIb including all 2010 sequences. 
The Trinidad II sequences were most closely related to sequences from Brazil 
(1999, 2004) and Uruguay (2007, 2008). Phylogeographic analyses support three 
separate RABV introductions from the mainland from which each of the three 
Trinidadian lineages arose. The estimated dates for the introductions and 
subsequent lineage expansions suggest periods of in situ evolution within 
Trinidad following each introduction. These data also indicate co-circulation of 
Trinidad lineage I and IIa during 2000. In light of these findings and the 
likely vampire bat origin of Trinidadian RABV, further studies should be 
conducted to investigate the relationship between RABV spatiotemporal dynamics 
and vampire bat population ecology, in particular any movement between the 
mainland and Trinidad.

Campylobacter is the most common cause of bacterial food-borne diarrhoeal 
disease worldwide. Chicken meat is considered the main source of human 
infection; however, C. jejuni and C. coli have also been reported in a range of 
livestock and wildlife species, including pheasants. Wild pheasant meat reaches 
the consumer's table because of hunting but there is a lack of information 
concerning the risk of Campylobacter infection in humans. This study aimed to 
determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in wild game pheasants in Scotland, to 
identify the main sequence types (STs) present and to evaluate their impact on 
public health. A total of 287 caecal samples from five Scottish regions were 
collected during the hunting season 2013/2014. Campylobacter was detected and 
enumerated using standard culture methods. PCR and High Throughput Multi Locus 
Sequence Typing (HiMLST) were used for species identification and sequence 
typing. In total, 36.6% of 287 caecal samples (n = 105; 95% CI: 14-59.2) were 
Campylobacter positive. Using PCR, 62.6% of samples (n = 99) were identified as 
C. coli and 37.4% as C. jejuni. HiMLST (n = 80) identified 19 different STs. 
ST-828 (n = 19) was the most common, followed by ST-827 (n = 12) and ST19 
(n = 7). Sixteen of the 19 STs isolated are present in humans and eight are 
C. coli STs that account for 6.96% of human infections, although the overall 
risk to public health from pheasant meat is still considered to be low.

One of the major problems of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the 
frequent emergence of new variants. In the present study 205 tracheal swabs and 
organs were collected from broilers and layers chicken farms during January to 
August 2012 from 19 governorates all over Egypt. The chickens demonstrated 
respiratory signs and mortality. Out of the examined samples, 130 of which 
(about 64%) of suspected farms were positive for IBV with real time RT-PCR. 13 
IBV-positive samples were selected for further isolation and characterization. 
Isolation in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryos was carried out after studies 
three blind successive passages and the hypervariable region of spike protein1 
(SP1) was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to study the genetic diversity 
between the isolated viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences of 
13 isolates compared with other IBV strains from the Middle East and worldwide 
reveled that 11 out of the 13 isolates had close relationship the Israeli 
variants (IS/885 and IS/1494/06) with nucleotide homology reached up to 89.9% 
and 82.3%, respectively. Only two isolates had close relationship with CR/88121 
and 4/91 viruses with identities of 95% and 96%, respectively. This study 
indicates existence of two variant groups of IBV circulating in Egypt during 
2012. Group I was similar but distinguishable from Israeli variant IS/885 and 
group II was related to 4/91 and CR/88121 vaccine strains. There was no 
geographical link between the 2 groups as they were distributed all over the 
country. These findings necessitate the need to revise the vaccination programs 
and control measures for IBV.

The broad-spectrum lytic capability of Salmonella bacteriophages against various 
Salmonella species was evaluated to determine their potential as an alternative 
for antibiotics, and the safety and preventive effects of the bacteriophages 
were assessed on mice and pigs. Four bacteriophage cocktails were prepared using 
13 bacteriophages, and the lytic capability of the four bacteriophage cocktails 
was tested using Salmonella reference strains and field isolates. Bacteriophage 
cocktail C (SEP-1, SGP-1, STP-1, SS3eP-1, STP-2, SChP-1, SAP-1, SAP-2; ≥109 
pfu/ml) showed the best lytic activity against the Salmonella reference strains 
(100% of 34) and field isolates (92.5% of 107). Fifty mice were then orally 
inoculated with bacteriophage cocktail C to determine the distribution of 
bacteriophages in various organs, blood and feces. The effects of bacteriophages 
on Salmonella infection in weaned pigs (n=15) were also evaluated through an 
experimental challenge with Salmonella Typhimurium after treatment with 
bacteriophage cocktail C. All mice exhibited distribution of the bacteriophages 
in all organs, blood and feces until 15 days post infection (dpi). After 35 dpi, 
bacteriophages were not detected in any of these specimens. As demonstrated in a 
pig challenge study, treatment with bacteriophage cocktail C reduced the level 
of Salmonella shedding in feces. The metagenomic analyses of these pig feces 
also revealed that bacteriophage treatment decreased the number of species of 
the Enterobacteriaceae family without significant disturbance to the normal 
fecal flora. This study showed that bacteriophages effectively controlled 
Salmonella in a pig challenge model and could be a good alternative for 
antibiotics to control Salmonella infection.

BACKGROUND: Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most deadly diseases of poultry 
around the globe. The disease is endemic in Pakistan and recurrent outbreaks are 
being reported regularly in wild captive, rural and commercial poultry flocks. 
Though, efforts have been made to characterize the causative agent in some of 
parts of the country, the genetic nature of strains circulating throughout 
Pakistan is currently lacking.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: To ascertain the genetics of NDV, 452 blood samples were 
collected from 113 flocks, originating from all the provinces of Pakistan, 
showing high mortality (30-80%). The samples represented domesticated poultry 
(broiler, layer and rural) as well as wild captive birds (pigeons, turkeys, 
pheasants and peacock). Samples were screened with real-time PCR for both matrix 
and fusion genes (1792 bp), positive samples were subjected to amplification of 
full fusion gene and subsequent sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site 
indicated the presence of motif (112RK/RQRR↓F117) typical for velogenic strains 
of NDV. Phylogenetic analysis of hypervariable region of the fusion gene 
indicated that all the isolates belong to lineage 5 of NDV except isolates 
collected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. A higher resolution of the 
phylogenetic analysis of lineage 5 showed the distribution of Pakistani NDV 
strains to 5b. However, the isolates from KPK belonged to lineage 4c; the first 
report of such lineage from this province.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, data indicated the prevalence of multiple lineages 
of NDV in different poultry population including wild captive birds. Such 
understanding is crucial to underpin the nature of circulating strains of NDV, 
their potential for interspecies transmission and disease diagnosis and control 
strategies.

Comparative analysis reveals frequent recombination in the parvoviruses,"<jats:p>Parvoviruses are small single-stranded DNA viruses that are ubiquitous in nature. Infections with both autonomous and helper-virus dependent parvoviruses are common in both human and animal populations, and many animals are host to a number of different parvoviral species. Despite the epidemiological importance of parvoviruses, the presence and role of genome recombination within or among parvoviral species has not been well characterized. Here we show that natural recombination may be widespread in these viruses. Different genome regions of both porcine parvoviruses and Aleutian mink disease viruses have conflicting phylogenetic histories, providing evidence for recombination within each of these two species. Further, the rodent parvoviruses show complex evolutionary histories for separate genomic regions, suggesting recombination at the interspecies level.</jats:p>",0

We performed a phylogenetic analysis of caprine and ovine lentiviruses using 
long sequences in gag and pol of 104 new Swiss isolates and six available 
corresponding database sequences. Forty-five isolates, forming five sequence 
clusters, were unclassifiable by the present classification. Pairwise DNA 
distance analysis indicated different categories of relatedness, requiring a new 
classification system. We propose four principal sequence groups, A-D, which 
differ by 25-37%. Groups A and B are further divided into subtypes which differ 
by 15-27%. Group D and four of the seven group A subtypes, A3, A4, A5 and A7, 
are formed by new Swiss isolates. Molecular epidemiology revealed that Swiss B1 
strains differed no more from French, Brazilian or US strains than from each 
other, suggesting virus propagation through international livestock trade. 
Furthermore, infection of goats by subtypes A3 or A4 was significantly 
associated with documented contact with sheep, which also harbor these subtypes, 
thus indicating regularly occurring sheep-to-goat transmission.

RNA viruses have been associated with enteritis in poultry and have been 
isolated from diseased birds. The same viral agents have also been detected in 
healthy flocks bringing into question their role in health and disease. In order 
to understand better eukaryotic viruses in the gut, this project focused on 
evaluating alternative methods to purify and concentrate viral particles, which 
do not involve the use of density gradients, for generating viral metagenome 
data. In this study, the sequence outcomes of three tissue processing methods 
have been evaluated and a data analysis pipeline has been established for RNA 
viruses from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, with the use of the best 
method and increased sequencing depth, a glimpse of the RNA viral community in 
the gastrointestinal tract of a clinically normal 5-week old turkey is 
presented. The viruses from the Reoviridae and Astroviridae families together 
accounted for 76.3% of total viruses identified. The rarefaction curve at the 
species level further indicated that majority of the species diversity was 
included with the increased sequencing depth, implying that viruses from other 
viral families were present in very low abundance.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a small, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in 
the genus Enterovirus, family Picornavirus. It causes hand, foot and mouth 
disease in infants and children, which in a small percentage of cases progresses 
to central nervous system infection, ranging from aseptic meningitis to fatal 
encephalitis. Sporadic cases of EV71 infection occur throughout the world, but 
large epidemics have occurred recently in Southeast Asia and China. There are 
currently no approved vaccines or antiviral therapies for the prevention or 
treatment of EV71 infection. This paper reviews efforts to develop antiviral 
therapies against EV71.

A Naturally Occurring Recombinant Enterovirus Expresses a Torovirus Deubiquitinase,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Enteroviruses (EVs) are implicated in a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. In this study, a novel enterovirus (enterovirus species G [EVG]) (EVG 08/NC_USA/2015) was isolated from a diagnostic sample from a neonatal pig diarrhea case and identified by using metagenomics and complete genome sequencing. The viral genome shares 75.4% nucleotide identity with a prototypic EVG strain (PEV9 UKG/410/73). Remarkably, a 582-nucleotide insertion, flanked by 3C
            <jats:sup>pro</jats:sup>
            cleavage sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, was found in the 2C/3A junction region of the viral genome. This insertion encodes a predicted protease with 54 to 68% amino acid identity to torovirus (ToV) papain-like protease (PLP) (ToV-PLP). Structural homology modeling predicts that this protease adopts a fold and a catalytic site characteristic of minimal PLP catalytic domains. This structure is similar to those of core catalytic domains of the foot-and-mouth disease virus leader protease and coronavirus PLPs, which act as deubiquitinating and deISGylating (interferon [IFN]-stimulated gene 15 [ISG15]-removing) enzymes on host cell substrates. Importantly, the recombinant ToV-PLP protein derived from this novel enterovirus also showed strong deubiquitination and deISGylation activities and demonstrated the ability to suppress IFN-β expression. Using reverse genetics, we generated a ToV-PLP knockout recombinant virus. Compared to the wild-type virus, the ToV-PLP knockout mutant virus showed impaired growth and induced higher expression levels of innate immune genes in infected cells. These results suggest that ToV-PLP functions as an innate immune antagonist; enterovirus G may therefore gain fitness through the acquisition of ToV-PLP from a recombination event.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Enteroviruses comprise a highly diversified group of viruses. Genetic recombination has been considered a driving force for viral evolution; however, recombination between viruses from two different orders is a rare event. In this study, we identified a special case of cross-order recombination between enterovirus G (order
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Picornavirales</jats:named-content>
            ) and torovirus (order
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Nidovirales</jats:named-content>
            ). This naturally occurring recombination event may have broad implications for other picornaviral and/or nidoviral species. Importantly, we demonstrated that the exogenous ToV-PLP gene that was inserted into the EVG genome encodes a deubiquitinase/deISGylase and potentially suppresses host cellular innate immune responses. Our results provide insights into how a gain of function through genetic recombination, in particular cross-order recombination, may improve the ability of a virus to evade host immunity.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically 
important swine disease affecting swine worldwide. Northwest China has a sparse 
pig population and there is no comprehensive information currently available on 
PRRSV infection. In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological features and 
genetic diversity of PRRSV from this region. 322 field-isolated tissues or serum 
samples were collected from aborted pig fetuses or pigs with respiratory disease 
from 15 herds, twice over a period of 2 years. PRRSV infection was determined 
and virus strains were classified by the sequencing of GP5. We found that 35.9 % 
of the animals were PRRSV-positive, and the average prevalence in 2007-2008 and 
2009-2010 was 46.5 and 29.3 %, respectively. To further investigate the genetic 
divergence of PRRSV samples collected from 2007 to 2010, 32 strains were 
isolated for GP5 sequencing and analysis, and phylogenetic trees were created 
based on GP5 amino acid sequences. All PRRSVs were of the North American 
genotype and belonged to the highly pathogenic HP-PRRSV subgenotype. Isolates 
from the Xinjiang province formed a tightly clustered branch and were closely 
related to an evolutionary intermediate subgroup isolate. Virus sequences from 
2007 to 2008 were compared with those from 2009 to 2010 from the same herd. New 
mutations were found in isolates after 2009 and focused on nucleotides in the 
GP5 antibody decoy epitope. PRRSV strains in Northwest China from 2007 to 2010 
were similar to those from other regions of China, with some regional 
characteristics. These results contribute to the knowledge of PRRSV epidemiology 
in China.

In light of the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease, there is an urgent need 
to develop effective therapeutics to treat Ebola infection, and drug repurposing 
screening is a potentially rapid approach for identifying such therapeutics. We 
developed a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) 1536-well plate assay to screen for entry 
inhibitors of Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) containing the glycoprotein (GP) 
and the matrix VP40 protein fused to a beta-lactamase reporter protein and 
applied this assay for a rapid drug repurposing screen of Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. We report here the identification of 53 
drugs with activity of blocking Ebola VLP entry into cells. These 53 active 
compounds can be divided into categories including microtubule inhibitors, 
estrogen receptor modulators, antihistamines, antipsychotics, pump/channel 
antagonists, and anticancer/antibiotics. Several of these compounds, including 
microtubule inhibitors and estrogen receptor modulators, had previously been 
reported to be active in BSL-4 infectious Ebola virus replication assays and in 
animal model studies. Our assay represents a robust, effective and rapid 
high-throughput screen for the identification of lead compounds in drug 
development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection.

BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus is one of world's major uncontrolled pathogen, 
causing seasonal epidemic as well as global pandemic. This was evidenced by 
recent emergence and continued prevalent 2009 swine origin pandemic H1N1 
Influenza A virus, provoking first true pandemic in the past 40 years. In the 
course of its evolution, the virus acquired many mutations and multiple 
unidentified molecular determinants are likely responsible for the ability of 
the 2009 H1N1 virus to cause increased disease severity in humans. Availability 
of limited data on complete genome hampers the continuous monitoring of this 
type of events. Outbreaks with considerable morbidity and mortality have been 
reported from all parts of the country.
METHODS/RESULTS: Considering a large number of clinical cases of infection 
complete genome based sequence characterization of Indian H1N1pdm virus and 
their phylogenetic analysis with respect to circulating global viruses was 
undertaken, to reveal the phylodynamic pattern of H1N1pdm virus in India from 
2009-2011. The Clade VII was observed as a major circulating clade in 
phylogenetic analysis. Selection pressure analysis revealed 18 positively 
selected sites in major surface proteins of H1N1pdm virus.
CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly revealed that clade VII has been identified as 
recent circulating clade in India as well globally. Few clade VII specific well 
identified markers undergone positive selection during virus evolution. 
Continuous monitoring of the H1N1pdm virus is warranted to track of the virus 
evolution and further transmission. This study will serve as a baseline data for 
future surveillance and also for development of suitable therapeutics.

Comparative metagenomics of microbial traits within oceanic viral communities,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Viral genomes often contain genes recently acquired from microbes. In some cases (for example, psbA) the proteins encoded by these genes have been shown to be important for viral replication. In this study, using a unique search strategy on the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) metagenomes in combination with marine virome and microbiome pyrosequencing-based datasets, we characterize previously undetected microbial metabolic capabilities concealed within the genomes of uncultured marine viral communities. A total of 34 microbial gene families were detected on 452 viral GOS scaffolds. The majority of auxiliary metabolic genes found on these scaffolds have never been reported in phages. Host genes detected in viruses were mainly divided between genes encoding for different energy metabolism pathways, such as electron transport and newly identified photosystem genes, or translation and post-translation mechanism related. Our findings suggest previously undetected ways, in which marine phages adapt to their hosts and improve their fitness, including translation and post-translation level control over the host rather than the already known transcription level control.</jats:p>",0

Whether dietary non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC), a rapid fermentable substance, 
affects immune homeostasis of rumen through the modulation of interactions of 
ruminal microbiota and epithelial toll-like receptors (TLRs) remains unclear. A 
combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCRs was applied to 
study the synergetic responses of ruminal microbiota and epithelial TLRs to the 
dietary NFC switch from 15 to 31% in the goat model. The results showed that the 
31% NFC diet caused the radical increases on the richness and diversity of rumen 
microbiota. The phylum Verrucomicrobia was most significantly expanded, whereas 
opportunistic pathogens, namely Rikenella, Anaeroplasma, and Olsenella, were 
significantly decreased. In rumen epithelium, the significantly increased 
expressions of TLR1, 6, 10 were associated with the significantly decreased 
expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß), IL-6, and 
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Constrained correlation analysis indicated 
that the increased abundance of commensal bacteria in Verrucomicrobia 
subdivision 5 contributed to the upregulation of TLR10 expression. Finally, the 
significantly increased concentrations of rumen short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 
coupled with the significantly upregulated expressions of epithelial genes 
related to SCFA absorption were observed in goats fed with 31% NFC diet. Thus, 
the NFC-induced expansion of rumen microbiota promoted epithelium tolerance by 
enhancement of the intensity of TLR10 signaling. The newly established 
equilibrium benefited to the transport of ruminal energy substances into the 
blood.

Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) has spread to the major duck-farming region in China, 
causing acute egg-production drop in Chinese duck population. In this study, we 
characterized a DTMUV strain (named GD2014) isolated from an egg-production drop 
duck farm in Guangdong province, South China. The virus was pathogenic to 
Muscovy duck embryos and caused severe egg production drop for laying Muscovy 
ducks. The genome sequence of GD2014 shared 97-99% homologies with other 
waterfowl-origin Tembusu viruses, and shared 89% identities with MM1775 strain 
isolated from mosquito. Phylogenetic analysis of entire open reading frame 
(ORF), E gene and NS5 gene indicated that GD2014 belonged to Ntaya group. These 
results have implications for understanding the orgin, emergence and 
pathogenicity of DTMUV as well as for the development of vaccines and 
diagnostics based on epidemiological data.

We recently described the isolation of a novel influenza virus from swine 
exhibiting respiratory disease in the United States that is distantly related to 
human influenza C virus. Based on genetic, biochemical and morphological 
analysis, the virus was provisionally classified as C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 
(C/OK). To further understand the genetics and evolution of this novel pathogen, 
we performed a comprehensive analysis of its sequence and phylogeny. The results 
demonstrated that C/OK and human influenza C viruses share a conserved array of 
predicted functional domains in the viral RNA genome replication and viral entry 
machinery but vary at key functional sites. Furthermore, our evolutionary 
analysis showed that homologous genes of C/OK and human influenza C viruses 
diverged from each other an estimated several hundred to several thousand years 
ago. Taken together, the findings described in this study support and extend our 
previous observations that C/OK is a genetically and evolutionarily distinct 
influenza virus in the family Orthomyxoviridae.

Mosquitoes as one of the most common but important vectors have the potential to 
transmit or acquire a lot of viruses through biting, however viral flora in 
mosquitoes and its impact on mosquito-borne disease transmission has not been 
well investigated and evaluated. In this study, the metagenomic techniquehas 
been successfully employed in analyzing the abundance and diversity of viral 
community in three mosquito samples from Hubei, China. Among 92,304 reads 
produced through a run with 454 GS FLX system, 39% have high similarities with 
viral sequences belonging to identified bacterial, fungal, animal, plant and 
insect viruses, and 0.02% were classed into unidentified viral sequences, 
demonstrating high abundance and diversity of viruses in mosquitoes. 
Furthermore, two novel viruses in subfamily Densovirinae and family 
Dicistroviridae were identified, and six torque tenosus virus1 in family 
Anelloviridae, three porcine parvoviruses in subfamily Parvovirinae and a Culex 
tritaeniorhynchus rhabdovirus in Family Rhabdoviridae were preliminarily 
characterized. The viral metagenomic analysis offered us a deep insight into the 
viral population of mosquito which played an important role in viral initiative 
or passive transmission and evolution during the process.

Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a member of the genus 
betacoronavirus within the family coronaviridae, which invades the central 
nervous system (CNS) via peripheral nervous system and causes encephalomyelitis 
or vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) in sucking piglets. Up to now, although 
few complete nucleotide sequences of PHEV have been reported, they are not 
annotated. This study aimed to illuminate genome characterization, phylogenesis 
and pathogenicity of the PHEV/2008 strain. The full length of the PHEV/2008 
strain genome was 30,684 bp, with a G + C content of 37.27%. The genome included 
at a minimum of 11 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5' and 3' 
untranslated regions (UTR) of 211 and 289 nucleotides. The replicase 
polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which had 4382 and 7094 amino acid residues, 
respectively, were predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral 
proteinases. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome sequence 
revealed that PHEV/2008 strain was genetically different from other known PHEV 
types, which represented a novel genotype (GI-1). In addition, we found that 
PHEV/2008 was neurotropic and highly pathogenic to 4-week-old BALB/c mice. Taken 
together, this is the first detailed annotated, complete genomic sequence of a 
new genotype PHEV strain in China.

Since its first discovery two decades ago, porcine reproductive and respiratory 
syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been the subject of intensive research due to its 
huge impact on the worldwide swine industry. Thanks to the phylogenetic 
analyses, much has been learned concerning the genetic diversity and evolution 
history of the virus. In this review, we focused on the evolutionary and 
epidemiological aspects of PRRSV from a phylogenetic perspective. We first 
described the diversity and transmission dynamics of Type 1 and 2 PRRSV, 
respectively. Then, we focused on the more ancient evolutionary history of 
PRRSV: the time of onset of all existing PRRSV and an origin hypothesis were 
discussed. Finally, we summarized the results from previous recombination 
studies to assess the potential impact of recombination on the virus 
epidemiology.

In June 2013, the first human H6N1 influenza virus infection was confirmed in 
Taiwan. However, the origin and molecular characterization of this virus, 
A/Taiwan/2/2013 (H6N1), have not been well studied thus far. In the present 
report, we performed phylogenetic and coalescent analyses of this virus and 
compared its molecular profile/characteristics with other closely related 
strains. Molecular characterization of H6N1 revealed that it is a typical avian 
influenza virus of low pathogenicity, which might not replicate and propagate 
well in the upper airway in mammals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 
virus clusters with A/chicken/Taiwan/A2837/2013 (H6N1) in seven genes, except 
PB1. For the PB1 gene, A/Taiwan/2/2013 was clustered with a different H6N1 
lineage from A/chicken/Taiwan/ A2837/2013. Although a previous study 
demonstrated that the PB2, PA, and M genes of A/Taiwan/2/2013 might be derived 
from the H5N2 viruses, coalescent analyses revealed that these H5N2 viruses were 
derived from more recent strains than that of the ancestor of A/Taiwan/2/2013. 
Therefore, we propose that A/Taiwan/2/2013 is a reassortant from different H6N1 
lineages circulating in chickens in Taiwan. Furthermore, compared to avian 
isolates, a single P186L (H3 numbering) substitution in the hemagglutinin H6 of 
the human isolate might increase the mammalian receptor binding and, hence, this 
strain's pathogenicity in humans. Overall, human infection with this virus seems 
an accidental event and is unlikely to cause an influenza pandemic. However, its 
co-circulation and potential reassortment with other influenza subtypes are 
still worthy of attention.

H7N9 highly and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV and LPAIV, 
respectively) have been isolated from duck meat products that were brought 
illegally into Japan by flight passengers in their hand luggage. These H7N9 
virus isolates were phylogenetically closely related to those prevailing in 
China. Antigenic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin of the H7N9 HPAIV 
isolate was slightly different from those of the H7N9 LPAIV and older H7 
strains. These meat products contaminated with AIVs repeatedly brought into 
Japan lead to increased risks of poultry and public health. Continuous border 
disease control based on the detection and culling of infected poultry and meat 
products is, thus, essential for the prevention of introduction and spread of 
AIVs.

Metagenomic approach using next-generation DNA sequencing has facilitated the 
detection of many pathogenic viruses from fecal samples. However, in many cases, 
majority of the detected sequences originate from the host genome and bacterial 
flora in the gut. Here, to improve efficiency of the detection of 
double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses from samples, we evaluated the applicability of 
S1 nuclease on deep sequencing. Treating total RNA with S1 nuclease resulted in 
1.5-28.4- and 10.1-208.9-fold increases in sequence reads of group A rotavirus 
in fecal and viral culture samples, respectively. Moreover, increasing coverage 
of mapping to reference sequences allowed for sufficient genotyping using 
analytical software. These results suggest that library construction using S1 
nuclease is useful for deep sequencing in the detection of dsRNA viruses.

The Asian/57, Hong Kong/68, and Russian/77 pandemics of this century appeared or 
reappeared in China. Interspecies transmission and genetic reassortment of 
influenza viruses have been implicated in the origin of these human pandemic 
influenza viruses. Pigs have been suspected to be the ""mixing vessel"" where 
reassortment occurs. To investigate this possibility, 104 porcine influenza 
viruses collected at random from Southern China from 1976 to 1982, including 32 
H3N2 isolates and 72 H1N1 isolates, were studied using dot blot hybridization, 
partial sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. There were 29 of 32 H3N2 isolates 
characteristic of viruses originally derived from humans; the other 3 isolates 
were reassortants containing genes from porcine and human influenza viruses. 
Phylogenetic analyses of the polymerase B1 (PB1) genes showed that interspecies 
transmission from humans to pigs has happened multiple times in pigs in Southern 
China. All 72 H1N1 isolates were of porcine origin characteristic of classical 
porcine H1N1 influenza virus. Analysis of 624 genes of porcine influenza viruses 
from Southern China failed to detect any evidence for avian influenza virus 
genes. This contrasts to what is currently found in Europe, where the majority 
of porcine influenza virus isolates are of avian origin.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E is a disease of major public-health concern mainly in 
developing countries. Although molecular and sero-epidemiological investigations 
of HEV have been performed in many provinces in China, the epidemiological data 
from Yunnan Province are limited and genotypes are not be fully characterized. 
In this study the prevalence and characteristics of hepatitis E virus (HEV) 
detected in pigs from Yunnan province, China was evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 13 out of 187 pig fecal samples collected in 2011 revealed 
HEV positive results; likewise, 7 out of 69 samples collected in 2012 exhibited 
positive results. These findings indicated a total prevalence of 7.8% (20/256). 
Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis results revealed that nine 
strains were found in the samples obtained in 2011, in which 87.1% to 99.4% 
nucleotide sequence identity was shared among these strains; and 77.0% to 81.9%, 
52.2% to 53.6%, 77.0% to 88.2% and 77.9% to 96.8% nucleotide sequence identities 
were shared with strains representing genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Five strains 
were detected in the samples obtained in 2012, in which 94.2% to 99.3% 
nucleotide sequence identity was shared among the strains, and 81.0% to 82.5%, 
81.8% to 83.2%, 81.0% to 92.7% and 81.0% to 97.8% nucleotide sequence identities 
were shared with strains representing the genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of fourteen detected HEV strains revealed that three of 
them were subtype 4d, two were subtype 4b; the nine remaining isolated strains 
were subtype 4 h. These results indicated that the prevalence of HEV in the 
swine herds of Yunnan was quite high, additional public-health concerns should 
focus on pork safety.

BACKGROUND: In late 2009/early 2010, approximately 2000 people were affected by 
a mysterious viral outbreak in a southern district of Tamil Nadu; this 
particularly affected those living in coastal areas. Blood samples from affected 
patients were sent for clinical analysis to determine the actual cause of the 
illness, but reports were inconclusive.
METHODS: The present study describes the clinical observations and laboratory 
investigations involving molecular methods performed on 170 of the 2000 
clinically suspected cases. These were patients who were admitted to Aravind Eye 
Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu with ocular complications. Conventional reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, and reverse 
transcription loop-mediated isothermal gene amplification (RT-LAMP) assays were 
used to detect West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Further investigation of the 
genetic diversity of the WNV implicated in ocular complications was undertaken 
by sequence phylogeny.
RESULTS: Out of 170 samples, 25 (15%) were positive for chikungunya IgM 
antibody, 10 (6%) for chikungunya antigen, and 30 (18%) were positive for dengue 
IgM antibody. The remaining 105 seronegative samples were further processed for 
WNV detection by IgM capture ELISA and molecular methods. Out of the 105 
samples, 35 (33%) were positive for WNV IgM antibody, 15 (14%) were positive for 
WNV by RT-PCR, and 27 (26%) were found to be positive for WNV by both real-time 
RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays. Comparative evaluation with acute-phase patient serum 
samples revealed 100% concordance between the real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP 
assays. These assays had an overall higher sensitivity than the conventional 
RT-PCR as they picked up 12 additional samples with a low copy number of 
template. Further genotyping through sequence phylogeny revealed that all the 
WNV isolates were grouped in lineage I.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of West Nile virus with ocular infection in South 
India during an epidemic of mysterious fever in the first half of 2010 was 
clearly established through molecular approaches employing envelope 
gene-specific real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays followed by nucleotide 
sequencing.

The full genomic nucleotide sequence of a previously identified genotype 3 
hepatitis E virus (HEV), strain SAAS-JDY5, was obtained using RT-PCR and rapid 
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The genome consisted of 7225 nucleotides, 
excluding a poly-A tail at the 3' terminus, and contained three open reading 
frames (ORFs), ORF-1, ORF-2 and ORF-3, encoding 1702, 660 and 113 amino acids, 
respectively. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that SAAS-JDY5 belonged to 
genotype 3 HEV and was most closely related to the Japanese isolate wbJYG1 
(AB222184). SAAS-JDY5 shared approximately 87% nucleotide similarity to human 
and swine strains from the United States, compared with 74-75% similarity to 
Asian (genotype 4) and Mexican strains (genotype 2). Alignment of the SAAS-JDY5 
genomic sequence with reference sequences of the same genotype revealed one 
nucleotide substitution and one deletion at positions 5145 and 7189 (3' UTR), 
respectively. Moreover, SAAS-JDY5 contained two additional nucleotides (AC) at 
the very end of the 3'-terminus preceding the poly-A tail of the genome. 
Comparison of the putative amino acid sequence encoded by the SAAS-JDY5 genome 
with sequences of other genotype 3 isolates revealed 15 unique amino acid 
substitutions and one deletion in ORF-1, and three substitutions in ORF-2.

Apparently, cows have independently evolved a retroviral restriction factor from the same TRIM family that spawned TRIM5 in primates. Particular features of this subset of cytoplasmic TRIM proteins may be conducive to the convergent evolution of virus-restricting factors.

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses isolated during 2006–2008 outbreaks in Pakistan reveals genetic diversity,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Since the first outbreak recorded in northern areas of Pakistan in early 2006, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses were isolated from commercial poultry and wild/domestic birds from different areas of Pakistan up to July 2008. Different isolates of H5N1 were sequenced to explore the genetic diversity of these viruses.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Phylogenetic analysis revealed close clustering and highest sequence identity in all 8 genes to HPAI H5N1 isolates belonging to unified H5 clade 2.2, sub-lineage EMA-3 recovered from Afghanistan during the same time period. Two subgroups within Pakistani H5N1 viruses, from domestic and wild birds, were observed on the basis of their sequence homology and mutations. HPAI motif, preferred receptor specificity for α-(2, 3) linkages, potential N-linked glycosylation sites and an additional glycosylation site at the globular head of HA protein of four Pakistani H5N1 isolates. While, the amino acids associated with sensitivities to various antiviral drugs (Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, Amantadine) were found conserved for the Pakistani H5N1 isolates. Conspicuously, some important mutations observed at critical positions of antigenic sites (S141P, D155S, R162I &amp; P181S) and at receptor binding pocket (A185T, R189K &amp; S217P) of HA-1. A high sequence similarity between Pakistani HP H5N1 and LP H9N2 viruses was also observed. Avian like host specific markers with the exception of E627K in PB2, K356R in PA, V33I in NP, I28V in M2 and L107F in NS2 proteins were also observed.</jats:p>

            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Various point mutations in different genes of H5 viruses from Pakistan were observed during its circulation in the field. The outbreaks started in Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa (North West) province in 2006 and spread to the Southern regions over a period of time. Though migratory birds may have a role for this continued endemicity of clade 2.2 H5N1 viruses during 2006–2008 in Pakistan, the possibility of their transmission through legal or illegal poultry trade across the borders cannot be ignored.</jats:p>

Characterization and classification of virus particles associated with hepatitis A. II. Type and configuration of nucleic acid,"<jats:p>Virus particles banding at 1.34 g/ml in CsCl and sedimenting at 160S in sucrose gradients were isolated from fecal specimens of patients suffering from hepatitis. In the presence of 4 M urea and about 90% formamide, these particles released linear nucleic acid molecules of the kinked appearance characteristic of single-stranded RNA or single-stranded DNA. They could be distinguished from the nucleic acid of phage lambda added to the preparation as a marker for double-stranded configuration. Experiments in which the virus particles under investigation were incubated at pH 12.9 at 50 degrees C for 30 min revealed that their nucleic acid molecules were hydrolyzed as readily as the RNA genome of poliovirus type 2 analyzed in parallel. Both the single-stranded DNA of phage phiX174 and that of parvovirus LuIII, however, proved unaffected by this treatment, and the double-stranded DNA of phage lambda was denatured to single-stranded molecules. It was concluded, therefore, that the virus of human hepatitis A contains a linear genome of single-stranded RNA and has to be classified with the picornaviruses.</jats:p>",0

Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are 11-segmented, double-stranded RNA viruses and 
important causes of gastroenteritis in the young of many animal species. 
Previous studies have suggested that human Wa-like RVAs share a close 
evolutionary relationship with porcine RVAs. Specifically, the VP1-VP3 and 
NSP2-5/6 genes of these viruses are usually classified as genotype 1 with >81% 
nucleotide sequence identity. Yet, it remains unknown whether the genotype 1 
genes and proteins of human Wa-like strains are distinguishable from those of 
porcine strains. To investigate this, we performed comprehensive bioinformatic 
analyses using all known genotype 1 gene sequences. The RVAs analyzed represent 
wildtype strains isolated from humans or pigs at various geographical locations 
during the years of 2004-2013, including 11 newly-sequenced porcine RVAs from 
Brazil. We also analyzed archival strains that were isolated during the years of 
1977-1992 as well as atypical strains involved in inter-species transmission 
between humans and pigs. We found that, in general, the genotype 1 genes of 
typical modern human Wa-like RVAs clustered together in phylogenetic trees and 
were separate from those of typical modern porcine RVAs. The only exception was 
for the NSP5/6 gene, which showed no host-specific phylogenetic clustering. 
Using amino acid sequence alignments, we identified 34 positions that 
differentiated the VP1-VP3, NSP2, and NSP3 genotype 1 proteins of typical modern 
human Wa-like RVAs versus typical modern porcine RVAs and documented how these 
positions vary in the archival/unusual isolates. No host-specific amino acid 
positions were identified for NSP4, NSP5, or NSP6. Altogether, the results of 
this study support the notion that human Wa-like RVAs and porcine RVAs are 
evolutionarily related, but indicate that some of their genotype 1 genes and 
proteins have diverged over time possibly as a reflection of sequestered 
replication and protein co-adaptation in their respective hosts.

Infectious bursal disease is a highly contagious disease of young chickens 
caused by Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Genome segment A encodes the 
capsid protein (VP2), while segment B encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
(VP1). In the present study, we trace the molecular epidemiology of IBDV in 
Brazil by analyzing 29 isolates collected in the major regions of poultry 
production. To genetically characterize the isolates, phylogenetic and 
population dynamic analyses were conducted using 68 VP1 (2634 nt) and 102 VP2 
(1356 nt) coding sequences from IBDV isolates from different regions of the 
world. Furthermore, the evolution of IBDV was analyzed by characterizing the 
selective forces that operated during the diversification of viral isolates. We 
show that IBDV isolates were introduced into Brazil mainly from the Netherlands 
and the USA. These introductions were associated with all Brazilian poultry 
production regions analyzed in this work. In addition, we show that the 
evolution of IBDV has been shaped by a combination of very low recombination 
rates and relatively high rates of nucleotide substitution (2.988×10(-4) for VP1 
and 3.2937×10(-4) for VP2), which themselves are a function of purifying 
selection operating on VP1 and VP2. Furthermore, our extended Bayesian skyline 
plot suggests that the increase in the effective population size of isolates of 
IBDV is consistent with its epidemiological history, with a large increase 
during the emergence of acute outbreaks of IBD in the 1980s.

Orf or contagious ecthyma is a neglected and economically important zoonotic 
disease caused by a dermatotropic parapoxvirus that commonly affects domestic 
small ruminants. Although orf is globally distributed, there is a paucity of 
information on the disease in many African countries. Here, a suspected severe 
outbreak of orf in goats at a farm in Lusaka was investigated. Orf virus (ORFV) 
infection was confirmed by PCR amplification of viral DNA (RNA polymerase, B2L 
and virus interferon-resistance genes) in clinical samples. Some detected genes 
were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. This is the first report on 
molecular characterization of ORFV in goats in Zambia.

In the present study, we used high-throughput sequencing, miRNA-seq, to discover 
and explore the expression profiles of known and novel miRNAs in TLR 
ligand-stimulated vis-à-vis non-stimulated (i.e. Control) peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from blood of healthy Murrah buffaloes. Six 
small RNA (sRNA) libraries were multiplexed in Ion Torrent PI chip and sequenced 
on Ion Proton System. The reads obtained were aligned to the Bos taurus genome 
(UMD3.1 assembly), which is phylogenetically closest species to buffalo (Bubalus 
bubalis). A total of 160 bovine miRNAs were biocomputationally identified in 
buffalo PBMCs and 130 putatively novel miRNAs (not enlisted in the bovine 
mirBase) were identified. All of these 290 miRNAs identified across the six 
treatment and control samples represent the repertoire of novel miRNAs for the 
buffalo species. The expression profiles of these miRNAs across the samples have 
been represented by sample dendrogram and heatmap plots. The uniquely expressed 
miRNAs in each treatment and control groups were identified. A few miRNAs were 
expressed at very high levels while the majority of them were moderately 
expressed. The miRNAs bta-miR-103 and -191 were found to be highly abundant and 
expressed in all the samples. Other abundantly expressed miRNAs include 
bta-miR-19b, -29b, -15a, -19a, -30d, -30b-5p and members of let family (let 
7a-5p, let 7g & let 7f) in LPS and CpG treated PBMCS and bta-miR-191, -103 & 
-19b in Poly I:C stimulated PBMCs. Only one novel miRNA (bta-miR-11039) out of 
130 identified putatively novel miRNAs, was expressed in all the six samples and 
differentially expressed (>2- fold) miRNAs were identified. Six of the 
differentially expressed miRNAs across the groups (bta-miR-421, bta-let-7i, 
bta-miR-138, bta-miR-21-5p, bta-miR-222 and bta-miR-27b) were subsequently 
confirmed by TaqMan quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR). Furthermore, the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were 
enriched for the roles in innate immunity and TLR signaling pathways. This 
maiden study on profiling and cataloguing of bubaline miRNAs expressed in 
TLR-ligand stimulated PBMCs will provide an important reference point for future 
studies on regulatory roles of miRNAs in immune system of buffaloes.

Individual weight gain in broiler growers appears to vary, which may in part be 
due to variation in their gut microbiota. In this paper we analyse the fecal 
microbiota of low and high feed conversion ratio (FCR) broilers. After shotgun 
sequencing of the fecal microbiome, we used the SEED database to identify the 
microbial diversity and metabolic potential in low and high FCR birds. The 
domain-level breakdown of our samples was bacteria (>95 %), eukaryotes (>2 %), 
archaea (>0.2 %), and viruses (>0.2 %). At the phylum level, Proteobacteria 
(78.83 % in low and 52.04 % in high FCR), Firmicutes (11.97 % in low and 27.53 % 
in high FCR) and Bacteroidetes (7.10 % in low FCR and 17.53 % in high FCR) 
predominated in the fecal microbial community. Poultry fecal metagenomes 
revealed the sequences related to 33 genera in both low and high FCR with 
significantly different proportion. Functional analysis revealed that genes for 
the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and derivatives and protein 
metabolism were most abundant in SEED subsystem in both samples. Genes 
associated with stress, virulence, cell wall and cell capsule were also 
abundant. Indeed, genes associated with sulphur assimilation, flagellum and 
flagellar motility were over represented in low FCR birds. This information 
could help in developing strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed 
formulation for broiler chickens.

"Complete Sequence Analyses of Enterovirus 71 Strains from Fatal and Non‐Fatal Cases of the Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease Outbreak in Singapore (2000)","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major aetiological agent of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). In recent years, several outbreaks in East Asia were associated with neurological complications and numerous deaths. An outbreak in Singapore in October 2000 afflicted thousands of children, resulting in four fatal cases from three of whom EV71 was isolated. The genomes of two representative EV71 strains isolated from a fatal case and a surviving patient were completely sequenced, and their nucleotide and amino acid sequences compared with known EV71 strains. The two outbreak strains were classified under genogroup B, together with those previously isolated in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan. Comparative sequence analysis of the two Singapore strains revealed 99% nucleotide similarity, while their deduced amino acid sequences were almost identical except for residue 1506 in the 3A non‐structural region. Given that the outbreak involved closely related genetic variants of EV71, the broad spectrum of disease severity may be attributed to critical factors such as varying viral inoculation doses or differing host immune responses following infection, but is less likely to be due to the emergence of EV71 strains with heightened virulence.</jats:p>",0
Complex virome in feces from Amerindian children in isolated Amazonian villages,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The number of viruses circulating in small isolated human populations may be reduced by viral extinctions and rare introductions. Here we used viral metagenomics to characterize the eukaryotic virome in feces from healthy children from a large urban center and from three Amerindian villages with minimal outside contact. Numerous human enteric viruses, mainly from the <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Caliciviridae</jats:italic> families, were sequenced from each of the sites. Multiple children from the same villages shed closely related viruses reflecting frequent transmission clusters. Feces of isolated villagers also contained multiple viral genomes of unknown cellular origin from the <jats:italic>Picornavirales</jats:italic> order and CRESS-DNA group and higher levels of nematode and protozoan DNA. Despite cultural and geographic isolation, the diversity of enteric human viruses was therefore not reduced in these Amazonian villages. Frequent viral introductions and/or increased susceptibility to enteric infections may account for the complex fecal virome of Amerindian children in isolated villages.</jats:p>",0

Over the past century, the southern sea otter (SSO; Enhydra lutris nereis) 
population has been slowly recovering from near extinction due to overharvest. 
The SSO is a threatened subspecies under federal law and a fully protected 
species under California law, US. Through a multiagency collaborative program, 
stranded animals are rehabilitated and released, while deceased animals are 
necropsied and tissues are cryopreserved to facilitate scientific study. Here, 
we processed archival tissues to enrich particle-associated viral nucleic acids, 
which we randomly amplified and deeply sequenced to identify viral genomes 
through sequence similarities. Anelloviruses and endogenous retroviral sequences 
made up over 50% of observed viral sequences. Polyomavirus, parvovirus, and 
adenovirus sequences made up most of the remaining reads. We characterized and 
phylogenetically analyzed the full genome of sea otter polyomavirus 1 and the 
complete coding sequence of sea otter parvovirus 1 and found that the closest 
known viruses infect primates and domestic pigs ( Sus scrofa domesticus), 
respectively. We tested archived tissues from 69 stranded SSO necropsied over 14 
yr (2000-13) by PCR. Polyomavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus infections were 
detected in 51, 61, and 29% of examined animals, respectively, with no 
significant increase in frequency over time, suggesting endemic infection. We 
found that 80% of tested SSO were infected with at least one of the three DNA 
viruses, whose tissue distribution we determined in 261 tissue samples. 
Parvovirus DNA was most frequently detected in mesenteric lymph node, 
polyomavirus DNA in spleen, and adenovirus DNA in multiple tissues (spleen, 
retropharyngeal and mesenteric lymph node, lung, and liver). This study 
describes the virome in tissues of a threatened species and shows that stranded 
SSO are frequently infected with multiple viruses, warranting future research to 
investigate associations between these infections and observed lesions.

Genetic Variability and the Classification of Hepatitis E Virus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            The classification of hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants is currently in transition without agreed definitions for genotypes and subtypes or for deeper taxonomic groupings into species and genera that could incorporate more recently characterized viruses assigned to the
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepeviridae</jats:named-content>
            family that infect birds, bats, rodents, and fish. These conflicts arise because of differences in the viruses and genomic regions compared and in the methodology used. We have reexamined published sequences and found that synonymous substitutions were saturated in comparisons between and within virus genotypes. Analysis of complete genome sequences or concatenated ORF1/ORF2 amino acid sequences indicated that HEV variants most closely related to those infecting humans can be consistently divided into six genotypes (types 1 to 4 and two additional genotypes from wild boar). Variants isolated from rabbits, closely related to genotype 3, occupy an intermediate position. No consistent criteria could be defined for the assignment of virus subtypes. Analysis of amino acid sequences from these viruses with the more divergent variants from chickens, bats, and rodents in three conserved subgenomic regions (residues 1 to 452 or 974 to 1534 of ORF1 or residues 105 to 458 of ORF2) provided consistent support for a division into 4 groups, corresponding to HEV variants infecting humans and pigs, those infecting rats and ferrets, those from bats, and those from chickens. This approach may form the basis for a future genetic classification of HEV into four species, with the more divergent HEV-like virus from fish (cutthroat trout virus) representing a second genus.

Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are significant human 
pathogens and are responsible for a substantial proportion of cases of severe 
acute hepatitis worldwide. Genetically, both viruses are heterogeneous and are 
classified into several genotypes that differ in their geographical distribution 
and risk group association. There is, however, little evidence that variants of 
HAV or HEV differ antigenically or in their propensity to cause severe disease. 
Genetically more divergent but primarily hepatotropic variants of both HAV and 
HEV have been found in several mammalian species, those of HAV being classified 
into eight species within the genus Hepatovirus in the virus family 
Picornaviridae. HEV is classified as a member of the species Orthohepevirus A in 
the virus family Hepeviridae, a species that additionally contains viruses 
infecting pigs, rabbits, and a variety of other mammalian species. Other species 
(Orthohepevirus B-D) infect a wide range of other mammalian species including 
rodents and bats.

Consensus proposals for classification of the family Hepeviridae,"<jats:p>The family <jats:italic>Hepeviridae</jats:italic> consists of positive-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian species, as well as chickens and trout. A subset of these viruses infects humans and can cause a self-limiting acute hepatitis that may become chronic in immunosuppressed individuals. Current published descriptions of the taxonomical divisions within the family <jats:italic>Hepeviridae</jats:italic> are contradictory in relation to the assignment of species and genotypes. Through analysis of existing sequence information, we propose a taxonomic scheme in which the family is divided into the genera <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> (all mammalian and avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates) and <jats:italic>Piscihepevirus</jats:italic> (cutthroat trout virus). Species within the genus <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> are designated <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> A (isolates from human, pig, wild boar, deer, mongoose, rabbit and camel), <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> B (isolates from chicken), <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> C (isolates from rat, greater bandicoot, Asian musk shrew, ferret and mink) and <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> D (isolates from bat). Proposals are also made for the designation of genotypes within the human and rat HEVs. This hierarchical system is congruent with hepevirus phylogeny, and the three classification levels (genus, species and genotype) are consistent with, and reflect discontinuities in the ranges of pairwise distances between amino acid sequences. Adoption of this system would include the avoidance of host names in taxonomic identifiers and provide a logical framework for the assignment of novel variants.</jats:p>",0
Dating the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses,"<jats:p>Pandemic influenza viruses cause significant mortality in humans. In the 20th century, 3 influenza viruses caused major pandemics: the 1918 H1N1 virus, the 1957 H2N2 virus, and the 1968 H3N2 virus. These pandemics were initiated by the introduction and successful adaptation of a novel hemagglutinin subtype to humans from an animal source, resulting in antigenic shift. Despite global concern regarding a new pandemic influenza, the emergence pathway of pandemic strains remains unknown. Here we estimated the evolutionary history and inferred date of introduction to humans of each of the genes for all 20th century pandemic influenza strains. Our results indicate that genetic components of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus circulated in mammalian hosts, i.e., swine and humans, as early as 1911 and was not likely to be a recently introduced avian virus. Phylogenetic relationships suggest that the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus (BM/1918) was generated by reassortment between mammalian viruses and a previously circulating human strain, either in swine or, possibly, in humans. Furthermore, seasonal and classic swine H1N1 viruses were not derived directly from BM/1918, but their precursors co-circulated during the pandemic. Mean estimates of the time of most recent common ancestor also suggest that the H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic strains may have been generated through reassortment events in unknown mammalian hosts and involved multiple avian viruses preceding pandemic recognition. The possible generation of pandemic strains through a series of reassortment events in mammals over a period of years before pandemic recognition suggests that appropriate surveillance strategies for detection of precursor viruses may abort future pandemics.</jats:p>",0

Bats are being increasingly recognized as an important reservoir of zoonotic 
viruses of different families, including SARS coronavirus, Nipah virus, Hendra 
virus and Ebola virus. Several recent studies hypothesized that bats, an ancient 
group of flying mammals, are the major reservoir of several important RNA virus 
families from which other mammalian viruses of livestock and humans were 
derived. Although this hypothesis needs further investigation, the premise that 
bats carry a large number of viruses is commonly accepted. The question of 
whether bats have unique biological features making them ideal reservoir hosts 
has been the subject of several recent reviews. In this review, we will focus on 
the public health implications of bat derived zoonotic viral disease outbreaks, 
examine the drivers and risk factors of past disease outbreaks and outline 
research directions for better control of future disease events.

Re-Assembly and Analysis of an Ancient Variola Virus Genome,"<jats:p>We report a major improvement to the assembly of published short read sequencing data from an ancient variola virus (VARV) genome by the removal of contig-capping sequencing tags and manual searches for gap-spanning reads. The new assembly, together with camelpox and taterapox genomes, permitted new dates to be calculated for the last common ancestor of all VARV genomes. The analysis of recently sequenced VARV-like cowpox virus genomes showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amino acid changes in the vaccinia virus (VACV)-Cop-O1L ortholog, predicted to be associated with VARV host specificity and virulence, were introduced into the lineage before the divergence of these viruses. A comparison of the ancient and modern VARV genome sequences also revealed a measurable drift towards adenine + thymine (A + T) richness.</jats:p>",0
"Novel Gyroviruses, including Chicken Anaemia Virus, in Clinical and Chicken Samples from South Africa","<jats:p><jats:italic>Introduction</jats:italic>. Chicken anaemia virus, CAV, was until recently the only member of the<jats:italic>Gyrovirus</jats:italic>genus. 6 novel gyroviruses, AGV2, HGyV1, and GyV3-6, have since been discovered in human and chicken samples.<jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. PCR amplification of the VP2 gene was used to detect AGV2/HGyV1, GyV3, and CAV in a range of clinical samples including stool, respiratory, CSF, and HIV-positive plasma. Screening of fresh local chicken meat was also performed.<jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. AGV2/HGyV1 or GyV3 was detected in stools from healthy children (17/49, 34.7%) and patients with diarrhoea (22/149, 14.8%). 1.2% (3/246) nasopharyngeal respiratory samples were positive. No AGV2/HGyV1 or GyV3 was detected in nasal swabs from wheezing patients, in CSF from patients with meningitis, and in HIVpositive plasma. CAV was found in 51% (25/49) of stools from healthy children and 16% (24/149) in diarrhoea samples. Screening of 28 chicken samples showed a higher prevalence of gyrovirus (20/28, 71%) compared to CAV (1/28, 3.6%). Phylogenetic analysis of the CAV VP1 gene showed South African sequences clustering with Brazilian isolates from genotypes D2 and A2.<jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>. Novel gyroviruses, including CAV, are present in the South African population with diarrhoea and respiratory illness as well as in healthy children. Their presence suggests an origin from chicken meat consumption.</jats:p>",0
A Review of the Strain Diversity and Pathogenesis of Chicken Astrovirus,"<jats:p>Although a relatively recently emerged virus, identified only in 2004 as a separate species of avian astrovirus, chicken astrovirus (CAstV) has been associated with poor growth of broiler flocks, enteritis and diarrhea and is a candidate pathogen in cases of runting stunting syndrome. More recently CAstV has been implicated in cases of two other diseases of broilers as the sole etiological agent, namely severe kidney disease of young broilers with visceral gout and the “White Chicks” hatchery disease. Examination of the strains of CAstV associated with the two latter diseases reveals they are closely related genetically. This review will discuss the pathogenesis of CAstV in relation to strain diversity and the effects of vertical versus horizontal transmission, virus load, co-infections and age of bird at infection, all factors that may impact upon disease severity.</jats:p>",0

A total of 512 tissue samples collected from 30 farms located in various states 
of Iran during 2008-2009 as part of a program to monitor avian influenza viruses 
(AIVs) infection in Iran's poultry population. To determine the genetic 
relationship of Iranian viruses, neuraminidase (NA) genes from ten isolates of 
H9N2 viruses isolated from commercial chickens in Iran during 2008-2009 were 
amplified and sequenced. The viruses' neuraminidase gene was >90% similar to 
those of A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2) sublineage. The neuraminidase stalk 
regions in these Viruses had no deletion as compared to that of 
chicken/Beijing/1/94 sublineage (Beijing-like viruses) and the two human 
isolates A/HK/1073/99, A/HK/1074/99. Phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase (NA) 
gene showed that it shares a common ancestor A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 isolate 
which had contributed the internal genes of the H5N1 virus. The results of this 
study indicated that No (Beijing-like) virus and (Korean-like) virus were found 
in chickens in Iran, and the NA genes of H9N2 influenza viruses circulating in 
Iran during the past years were well conserved and the earlier Iranian isolates 
may be considered to represent such a progenitor.

Outbreaks of pseudorabies (PRs) have occurred in Yunnan, China, which caused 
significant economic loss. To determine the prevalence and origin of PR in 
Yunnan, especially among vaccinated pigs, overall 791 samples of blood, tissue, 
semen, and sera were analyzed by serological methods, PCR, and sequence analysis 
of gD gene. Detection with viral gI antibody or PCR showed that the yearly 
positive rates of PR virus (PRV) in Yunnan from 2010 to 2014 were 48.15, 21.26, 
2.17, 5.22, and 0.35%, respectively, with an average of 15.43%. In general, the 
incidence declined through the period of 2010-2014 probably due to the 
application of PRV eradication strategies. A phylogenetic tree was constructed 
based on the complete sequence of gD gene, with all strains clustered into two 
independent clades, i.e., Asian and European-American clades. The virus isolates 
from Henan, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shandong, Fujian, Xinjiang, Hubei, 
Guangdong, and Yunnan fell into Asian group, which harbored South Korea isolate. 
Four Yunnan virus isolates together with South Korean Namyangju fell into in the 
European-American clade. It showed that PR was pandemic as there was not a clear 
clue about the geographical origin of the PRV isolates in China since 2010.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are two major etiologic 
agents associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide. Despite 
that they both belong to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family, 
there are many differences in the infection process of these viruses. However, 
the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Multiple studies indicated 
that microRNAs (miRNAs) can play critical roles in the host-pathogen 
interaction. Our previous study reported that EV71 and CA16 infection leads to 
differential expression of miRNAs in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. 
Herein, we aimed to further explore the expression profile and possible roles of 
other differentially expressed miRNAs in 16HBE cells following EV71 and CA16 
infections using high-throughput sequencing. We describe 44 novel differentially 
expressed miRNAs in all samples. Among these miRNAs, 7 novel differentially 
expressed miRNAs show an opposite expression trend during the progression of 
EV71 and CA16 infections. Subsequently, bioinformatics analyses, including Gene 
Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, were 
used to identify the biological processes, molecular functions, cellular 
components, and pathways involved. The top 10 significant GO and Pathway 
annotations indicated that 849 target genes are involved in cell development, 
such as nervous system development, multicellular organism development, and 
developmental biology. Finally, the genes identified in both the GO and Pathway 
analysis were used to construct a co-expression network to further identify the 
potential function of these co-expressed genes. Thus, our data may be beneficial 
in guiding further studies on the molecular mechanism of developmental 
regulation in HFMD pathogenesis caused by EV71 and CA16. In addition, it 
provided new candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets for HFMD.

Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) is a member of the Picornaviridae family and causes 
mild and self-limiting hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in infants and young 
children. CA16 infection can also progress to central nervous system (CNS) 
complications; however, the underlying mechanism by which CA16 penetrates the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and then causes CNS damage remains unclear. This study 
aimed to explore the mechanism of CA16 neurotropic tropism by establishing an in 
vitro BBB model with CA16 infection and an in vivo CA16 rhesus monkey infant 
infection model. The results showed that CA16 infection induced increased 
permeability of the BBB accompanied by upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 
9 (MMP9) expression. Subsequently, high-throughput miRNA sequencing technology 
and bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-1303 may regulate BBB permeability 
by targeting MMP9. Next, we used dual-luciferase, qRT-PCR, and western blot 
assays to provide evidence of MMP9 targeting by miR-1303. Further experiments 
revealed that CA16 infection promoted the degradation of junctional complexes 
(Claudin4, Claudin5, VE-Cadherin, and ZO-1), likely by downregulating miR-1303 
and upregulating MMP9. Finally, EGFP-CA16 infection could enter the CNS by 
facilitating the degradation of junctional complexes, eventually causing 
neuroinflammation and injury to the CNS, which was confirmed using the in vivo 
rhesus monkey model. Our results indicate that CA16 might penetrate the BBB and 
then enter the CNS by downregulating miR-1303, which disrupts junctional 
complexes by directly regulating MMP9 and ultimately causing pathological CNS 
changes. These results provide new therapeutic targets in HFMD patients

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) remain the predominant 
pathogens in hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), but the factors underlying 
the pathogenesis of EV71 and CA16 infections have not been elucidated. Recently, 
the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host interactions have been 
highlighted. In the present study, we performed comprehensive miRNA profiling in 
EV71- and CA16-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at 
multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 
135 known miRNAs exhibited remarkable differences in expression. Of these, 30 
differentially expressed miRNAs presented opposite trends in EV71- and 
CA16-infected samples. Subsequently, we mainly focused on the 30 key 
differentially expressed miRNAs through further screening to predict targets. 
Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis of the predicted targets showed the 
enrichment of 14 biological processes, 9 molecular functions, 8 cellular 
components, and 85 pathways. The regulatory networks of these miRNAs with 
predicted targets, GOs, pathways, and co-expression genes were determined, 
suggesting that miRNAs display intricate regulatory mechanisms during the 
infection phase. Consequently, we specifically analyzed the hierarchical GO 
categories of the predicted targets involved in biological adhesion. The results 
indicated that the distinct changes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection may be 
partly linked to the function of the blood-brain barrier. Taken together, this 
is the first report describing miRNA expression profiles in HUVECs with EV71 and 
CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our data provide useful 
insights that may help to elucidate the different host-pathogen interactions 
following EV71 and CA16 infection and offer novel therapeutic targets for these 
infections.

High-Throughput Sequencing of Putative Novel microRNAs in Rhesus Monkey Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells following EV71 and CA16 Infection,"<jats:p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) remain the major pathogens in hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) cases, but the mechanisms of the different pathogeneses that follow EV71 and CA16 infection remain largely unknown. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Herein, we utilized microRNA (miRNA) deep sequencing to investigate the roles of novel differentially expressed miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with EV71 and CA16. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The results identified 13 novel differentially expressed miRNAs in each group. Additionally, the target genes were predicted by the miRanda and RNAhybrid programs, and a total of 2,501 targets were found in the two databases. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that these targets were mainly involved in cell development and were associated with nervous system development, system development, multicellular organism development, the Wnt signaling pathway, the PDGF signaling pathway, and the EGF receptor signaling pathway. Finally, a coexpression regulatory network was built with the key targets to further extrapolate the functional interactions of the targets and their coexpressed genes. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Our results not only revealed potential biomarkers or targets for the diagnosis and treatment of HFMD, but also provided new insights to explore the mechanisms of EV71 and CA16 pathogenesis.</jats:p>",0
Evidence of Human-to-Swine Transmission of the Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza Virus in South Korea,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>As the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus continues to infect human populations globally, reports on epidemiologically linked animal infections are also on the rise. Since December 2009, pandemic (H1N1) 2009-like viruses have been isolated in pigs from different swine farms of South Korea. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of viral segments demonstrated several events of human-to-swine transmission with no apparent signs of reassortment. These events were also supported by serological surveillance in pig sera collected from April to December, suggesting that reverse transmission probably started between June and July with a drastic increase in prevalence the following months. Although molecular characterization indicates that the swine isolates are generally stable, some viruses are genetically evolving, most notably in their surface proteins. Animal studies (ferrets and mice) reveal that swine pandemic isolates epitomize biological properties attributed to the currently circulating human pandemic viruses, including replication kinetics and efficient transmission, indicating their potential to return to circulation among humans. Overall, these results indicate widespread human-to-animal transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses in South Korea. With the significant role of pigs in the ecology of influenza viruses, these transmission events should be closely monitored and minimized to prevent the risk of generating viruses with greater human health concerns.</jats:p>",0

Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1) is a c-herpesvirus (c-HV) carried 
asymptomatically by wildebeest. Upon cross-species transmission, AlHV-1 induces 
a fatal lymphoproliferative disease named malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) in 
many ruminants, including cattle, and the rabbit model. Latency has been shown 
to be essential for MCF induction. However, the mechanisms causing the 
activation and proliferation of infected CD8+T cells are unknown. Many c-HVs 
express microRNAs (miRNAs). These small non-coding RNAs can regulate expression 
of host or viral target genes involved in various pathways and are thought to 
facilitate viral infection and/or mediate activation and proliferation of 
infected lymphocytes. The AlHV-1 genome has been predicted to encode a large 
number of miRNAs. However, their precise contribution in viral infection and 
pathogenesis in vivo remains unknown. Here, using cloning and sequencing of 
small RNAs we identified 36 potential miRNAs expressed in a lymphoblastoid cell 
line propagated from a calf infected with AlHV-1 and developing MCF. Among the 
sequenced candidate miRNAs, 32 were expressed on the reverse strand of the 
genome in two main clusters. The expression of these 32 viral miRNAs was further 
validated using Northern blot and quantitative reverse transcription PCR in 
lymphoid organs of MCF developing calves or rabbits. To determine the concerted 
contribution in MCF of 28 viralmiRNAs clustered in the non-protein-coding region 
of the AlHV-1 genome, a recombinant virus was produced. The absence of these 28 
miRNAs did not affect viral growth in vitro or MCF induction in rabbits, 
indicating that the AlHV-1 miRNAs clustered in this non-protein-coding genomic 
region are dispensable for MCF induction.

Pathological and molecular findings of avian avulavirus type 1 outbreak in pigeons (Columba livia) of southern Brazil,"<jats:p>ABSTRACT: The Newcastle disease, caused by avian avulavirus type 1 strains (APMV-1) is an important avian disease involved into high rates of mortality and economic losses. Several outbreaks have been reported over the last 30 years in Columbiformes in different parts of the world, caused by a adapted variant strain of AAvV-1, called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1). A high mortality associated with an outbreak was analyzed in free-living pigeons (Columba livia) in a public square in Porto Alegre in Southern Brazil. A total of 24 pigeons moribund or freshly dead, within five weeks interval were submitted to necropsy, histopathological, immunohistochemical (anti-Newcastle), and RT-PCR followed by sequencing of the amplification products analysis. They presented neurological signs, non-suppurative encephalitis and encephalomyelitis, and mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in different organs. Immunohistochemical analysis in nine pigeons tissue showed that anti-Newcastle was expressed in brain, kidney, liver and pancreas. The RT-PCR test for the M protein of Newcastle disease virus was positive in six pigeons. The differential diagnosis of Influenza, West Nile, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae in all pigeons presented negative results. The sequence of amino acids in the cleavage site region of the F protein was 112RRQKRF117 classifying the strain as virulent. The phylogenetic analysis classified this virus strain into Class II and VI genotype.</jats:p>",0

Characterization of Low-Pathogenicity H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses from North America,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Wild-bird surveillance in North America for avian influenza (AI) viruses with a goal of early identification of the Asian H5N1 highly pathogenic AI virus has identified at least six low-pathogenicity H5N1 AI viruses between 2004 and 2006. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from all 6 H5N1 viruses and an additional 38 North American wild-bird-origin H5 subtype and 28 N1 subtype viruses were sequenced and compared with sequences available in GenBank by phylogenetic analysis. Both HA and NA were phylogenetically distinct from those for viruses from outside of North America and from those for viruses recovered from mammals. Four of the H5N1 AI viruses were characterized as low pathogenicity by standard in vivo pathotyping tests. One of the H5N1 viruses, A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06, was shown to replicate to low titers in chickens, turkeys, and ducks. However, transmission of A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 was more efficient among ducks than among chickens or turkeys based on virus shed. The 50% chicken infectious dose for A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 and three other wild-waterfowl-origin H5 viruses were also determined and were between 10
            <jats:sup>5.3</jats:sup>
            and 10
            <jats:sup>7.5</jats:sup>
            50% egg infective doses. Finally, seven H5 viruses representing different phylogenetic clades were evaluated for their antigenic relatedness by hemagglutination inhibition assay, showing that the antigenic relatedness was largely associated with geographic origin. Overall, the data support the conclusion that North American H5 wild-bird-origin AI viruses are low-pathogenicity wild-bird-adapted viruses and are antigenically and genetically distinct from the highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 virus lineage.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the major causes of acute viral 
hepatitis worldwide. In Europe, food-borne zoonotic transmission of HEV genotype 
3 has been associated with domestic pigs and wild boar. Controversial data are 
available on the circulation of the virus in animals that are used for human 
consumption, and to date, no gold standard has yet been defined for the 
diagnosis of HEV-associated hepatitis. To investigate the current HEV infection 
status in Lithuanian pigs and wild ungulates, the presence of viral RNA was 
analyzed by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) in 
randomly selected samples, and the viral RNA was subsequently genotyped.
RESULTS: In total, 32.98 and 22.55% of the domestic pig samples were 
HEV-positive using RT-nPCR targeting the ORF1 and ORF2 fragments, respectively. 
Among ungulates, 25.94% of the wild boar samples, 22.58% of the roe deer 
samples, 6.67% of the red deer samples and 7.69% of the moose samples were 
positive for HEV RNA using primers targeting the ORF1 fragment. Using primers 
targeting the ORF2 fragment of the HEV genome, viral RNA was only detected in 
17.03% of the wild boar samples and 12.90% of the roe deer samples. Phylogenetic 
analysis based on a 348-nucleotide-long region of the HEV ORF2 showed that all 
obtained sequences detected in Lithuanian domestic pigs and wildlife belonged to 
genotype 3. In this study, the sequences identified from pigs, wild boars and 
roe deer clustered within the 3i subtype reference sequences from the GenBank 
database. The sequences obtained from pig farms located in two different 
counties of Lithuania were of the HEV 3f subtype. The wild boar sequences 
clustered within subtypes 3i and 3h, clearly indicating that wild boars can 
harbor additional subtypes of HEV. For the first time, the ORF2 nucleotide 
sequences obtained from roe deer proved that HEV subtype 3i can be found in a 
novel host.
CONCLUSION: The results of the viral prevalence and phylogenetic analyses 
clearly demonstrated viral infection in Lithuanian pigs and wild ungulates, thus 
highlighting a significant concern for zoonotic virus transmission through both 
the food chain and direct contact with animals. Unexpected HEV genotype 3 
subtype diversity in Lithuania and neighboring countries revealed that further 
studies are necessary to understand the mode of HEV transmission between animals 
and humans in the Baltic States region.

Physical and chemical characterization of an avian reovirus,"<jats:p>The avian viral agent S1133 has previously been classified serologically as a member of the avian reovirus group. This viral agent grows in chicken embryo fibroblast cells, bands at a density of 1.37 g/ml in CsCl equilibrium density gradients, has a particle diameter of 75 nm, and has a morphology similar to that of human reovirus type 3. Its nucleic acid is comprised of double-stranded RNA and adenosine-rich oligonucleotides. The dsRNA is distributed among 10 segments with molecular weights of 2.7 x 10(6), 2.6 x 10(6), 1.7 x 10(6), 1.5 x 10(6), 1.3 x 10(6), 1.2 x 10(6), 0.80 x 10(6), 0.74 x 10(6), and 0.68 x 10(6) for the largest (L1) to the smallest (S4) segment, respectively, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These 10 segments migrate differently on polyacrylamide gels compared to those of human reovirus type 3. The capsid proteins of avian reovirus consist of eight species of polypeptides as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These are lambda1, lambda2, lambda3, mu1, mu2, sigma1, sigma2, and sigma3 with molecular weights of 140, 125, 115, 85, 72, 40, 36, and 32 x 10(3), respectively. Only polypeptide sigma2, which resides in the inner capsid or core, comigrated with the sigma2 polypeptide of type 3 reovirus. Antiserum against type 3 reovirus did not neutralize avian reovirus. Avian reovirus core particles were found to possess a transcriptase and a methylase activity.</jats:p>",0

Dual infections with both bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)-1 and -2 seem to be 
unusual. The aim of this study was to describe an infection with both BVDV 
genotypes in a stillborn calf. Virus isolation and phylogenetic analyses of the 
5´UTR and NS5B regions confirmed the presence of BVDV-1b and -2b in spleen and 
lung, whereas BVDV-2b was also detected in brain, heart, liver, kidney and, 
fluid of cavities. These results confirm that dual infections with both BVDV-1 
and BVDV-2 species can occur naturally and their tissue distribution can be 
different.

Orf virus, a member of the genus Parapoxvirus, is the causative agent of 
contagious ecthyma ('Orf'). It is a pathogen with worldwide distribution, 
causing significant financial losses in livestock production. The disease mainly 
affects sheep and goats, but various other ruminants and mammals have been 
reported to be infected as well. It is also a zoonotic disease, affecting mainly 
people who come in direct or indirect contact with infected animals (e.g. 
farmers, veterinarians). The disease is usually benign and self-limiting, 
although in many cases, especially in young animals, it can be persistent and 
even fatal. Production losses caused by Orf virus are believed to be 
underestimated, as it is not a notifiable disease. This review of literature 
presents all latest information regarding the virus; considerations regarding 
treatment and prevention will be also discussed.

Twenty bursal samples were obtained from four infectious bursal disease virus 
(IBDV)-vaccinated layer flocks experiencing problems with immune suppression 
that was thought to be infectious bursal disease. All the samples were found to 
be positive for IBDV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the samples 
identified them as classic molecular group 3 and group 4 viruses. Two samples 
from each of the four flocks were sequenced, and within a flock, these sequences 
were identical; however, between flocks, some differences were observed. One 
virus from each of the four flocks was selected for further analysis. The VP2 
hypervariable sequence region of samples GA-1, H-30, and CS-2-35 had nucleotide 
and amino acid similarities with the D78 and Vi Bursa G classic vaccines that 
were used in those flocks. The sequence of HPR-2 was similar to the Bursa Vac 4 
vaccine used in that flock and the STC virulent classic IBDV strain. The deduced 
amino acid sequence of these isolates revealed that all the isolates had proline 
at position 222, which is characteristic of U.S. classic viruses. The 
phylogenetic analysis of these isolates on the basis of the VP2 hypervariable 
amino acid sequence clustered GA-1, H-30, and CS-2-35 with the D78 vaccine and 
HPR-2 with STC. The pathogenicity of these isolates was tested in 
specific-pathogen-free chickens. Bursa-body weight (B-BW) ratios and 
histopathologic lesion scores in the bursa were determined. Gross lesions were 
observed in the bursa, and the B-BW ratios of the birds infected with all four 
wild-type viruses were significantly different compared with the D78 vaccine and 
uninoculated control groups. Histopathology of the bursa from groups infected 
with GA-1, H-30, CS-2-35, and HPR-2 showed different degrees of follicular 
depletion and necrosis. A very slight lymphoid depletion was observed in the 
D78-infected group at 5 days postinoculation, and no microscopic lesions were 
observed in this group at 8 days postinoculation or at any time in the 
uninoculated control group. The bursa collected from the field virus and 
D78-infected birds at necropsy revealed the presence of IBDV via RT-PCR, and the 
VP-2 hypervariable nucleotide sequences of the GA-1, H-30, CS-2-35, HPR-2, and 
D78 samples were identical to the original viral isolates and vaccine, 
respectively.

The aim of this work was to genetically characterize Central European isolates 
of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and to evaluate the applicability of 
molecular analysis in the epizootiology of CSFV infections. Thirty four viruses, 
derived from Central European pigs or wild boar, were examined. All of these 
viruses were detected by each of three sets of oligonucleotide primers which had 
been designed for the specific RT-PCR amplification of different genomic 
regions. Comparative sequence analysis of the PCR products showed that they were 
of a genetic type common in Western Europe. Further discrimination of virus 
isolates was possible, into subgroups that largely coincided with their regions 
of origin in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Estonia. The discriminatory ability 
of the technique was improved by the analysis of a composite dataset consisting 
of all of the sequence data from all of the viruses. Using this approach we were 
able to distinguish between all of the viruses and to group them in a manner 
that precisely matched their geographical origins, apart from a single Estonian 
isolate which grouped with viruses from Eastern Poland.

Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is a novel circovirus species recently 
discovered in USA and China in cases of porcine dermatitis and nephropathy 
syndrome, reproductive failure, respiratory disease and multisystemic 
inflammation. This study reports on the first identification of PCV3 in Europe, 
in serum from pigs from Polish farms. A total of 1,050 serum samples were 
collected between 2014 and 2017 from sows and 3-20 weeks old pigs from 14 
commercial farms representing different regions of Poland, different size and 
health status. The samples were pooled by 4-6 and tested with real-time PCR for 
PCV3. PCV3 DNA was detected in 12 of 14 farms (85.7%). On the PCV3-positive 
farms, the virus was detected in 5.9% to 65% serum pools. PCV3 was most common 
among weaned pigs and finishers (26.1% and 28.0% of serum pools, respectively). 
Sequence analysis of 359 nucleotide fragment of ORF2 showed highest identity of 
99.7% to PCV3-US/SD2016 from USA. Our results indicate that PCV3 is a common 
virus among Polish pigs but no links to unexplained disease conditions were 
established.

BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is 
recognized worldwide as an important and economically devastating pathogen in 
pig production. Although PRRSV is widespread in domestic swine, there is a lack 
of information regarding PRRSV infection in European wild boars (Sus scrofa). 
Currently available information does not provide conclusive evidence that wild 
boars are a reservoir of PRRSV. Nevertheless, wild boars may be likely to become 
infected by domestic swine through occasional direct or indirect contact. 
Furthermore, wild boars can act as a reservoir for infectious diseases of 
domestic pigs. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to determine 
the virus prevalence and further explore the epidemiology and diversity of PRRSV 
strains present in Lithuanian wild boars over a 5-year period. A total of 1597 
tissue and serum samples from wild boars inhabiting 44 districts and ten 
counties in Lithuania were analysed using conventional nested reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time Taqman RT-PCR for 
the detection of PRRSV-specific open reading frame (ORF) 1 and 6 sequences.
RESULTS: PRRSV was highly prevalent in Lithuanian wild boar populations, with an 
average rate of 18.66 % using conventional RT-PCR and 19.54 % using real-time 
RT-PCR. PRRSV was detected in 36.71 and 41.77 % of 237 hunting grounds tested by 
conventional RT-nPCR and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. No statistically 
significant differences in PRRSV prevalence were observed by geographic area in 
the ten Lithuanian counties. Animals infected with PRRSV were identified in all 
age groups; however, significantly higher prevalence rates were identified in 
subadult and adult wild boars than in juveniles up to 12 months old. No positive 
results were obtained using conventional PCR with Type 2 specific primers. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF5 region revealed that ten wild boars 
harboured virus sequences belonging to genetic subtypes 3 and 4 and may 
therefore pose a serious threat to Lithuanian pig farms in which only subtype 
two strains are circulating.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of virus prevalence and phylogenetic analyses strongly 
support the role of wild boars as a possible natural reservoir for PRRSV in 
Lithuania.

BACKGROUND: Despite considerable host species barriers, interspecies 
transmissions of influenza A viruses between wild birds, poultry and pigs have 
been demonstrated repeatedly. In particular, viruses of the subtypes H1 and H3 
were transmitted between pigs and poultry, predominantly turkeys, in regions 
with a high population density of both species. The recovery of a swine 
influenza H1N1 virus from a turkey flock in Germany in 2009 prompted us to 
investigate molecularly the subtype H1 viruses recently detected in wild birds, 
pigs and poultry.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between 
H1N1 viruses originating from wild and domestic animals of Germany and to 
identify potential trans-species transmission or reassortment events.
METHODS: Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene or full-length genome sequences 
were generated from selected, current H1N1 viruses from wild birds, pigs and 
turkeys. Phylogenetic analyses were combined with genotyping and analyses of the 
deduced amino acid sequences with respect to biologically active sites. 
Antigenic relationships were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition reactions.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin sequences showed that 
viruses from distinct H1 subgroups co-circulate among domestic animals and wild 
birds. In addition, these viruses comprised different genotypes and were 
distinguishable antigenically. An H1N1 virus isolated from a turkey farm in 
northern Germany in 2009 showed the highest similarity with the avian-like 
porcine H1N1 influenza viruses circulating in Europe since the late 1970s.
CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate the genetic and antigenic heterogeneity of H1 
viruses currently circulating in domestic and wild animals in Germany and points 
to turkeys as a possible bridge between avian and mammalian hosts.

In recent years, innovations in molecular techniques and sequencing technologies 
have resulted in a rapid expansion in the number of known viral sequences, in 
particular those with circular replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding 
single-stranded (CRESS) DNA genomes. CRESS DNA viruses are present in the virome 
of many ecosystems and are known to infect a wide range of organisms. A large 
number of the recently identified CRESS DNA viruses cannot be classified into 
any known viral families, indicating that the current view of CRESS DNA viral 
sequence space is greatly underestimated. Animal faecal matter has proven to be 
a particularly useful source for sampling CRESS DNA viruses in an ecosystem, as 
it is cost-effective and non-invasive. In this study a viral metagenomic 
approach was used to explore the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses present in the 
faeces of domesticated and wild animals in New Zealand. Thirty-eight complete 
CRESS DNA viral genomes and two circular molecules (that may be defective 
molecules or single components of multicomponent genomes) were identified from 
forty-nine individual animal faecal samples. Based on shared genome 
organisations and sequence similarities, eighteen of the isolates were 
classified as gemycircularviruses and twelve isolates were classified as 
smacoviruses. The remaining eight isolates lack significant sequence similarity 
with any members of known CRESS DNA virus groups. This research adds 
significantly to our knowledge of CRESS DNA viral diversity in New Zealand, 
emphasising the prevalence of CRESS DNA viruses in nature, and reinforcing the 
suggestion that a large proportion of CRESS DNA viruses are yet to be 
identified.

Isolation and cloning of two variant papillomaviruses from domestic pigs: Sus scrofa papillomaviruses type 1 variants a and b,"<jats:p>The healthy skin of two female domestic pigs (<jats:italic>Sus scrofa domestica</jats:italic>) was sampled with cotton-tipped swabs. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the samples and subjected to PCR with degenerate papillomavirus (PV)-specific primers. Similarity searches performed with <jats:sc>blastn</jats:sc> showed that partial E1 and L1 sequences of two novel PVs were amplified. Subsequently, the complete genomes of these <jats:italic>Sus scrofa</jats:italic> papillomaviruses (SsPVs) were amplified by long-template PCR, cloned and sequenced using a transposon insertion method. They contained the typical PV open reading frames (ORFs) E1, E2, E4, E6, L1 and L2, but the E7 ORF was absent in both viruses. Pairwise nucleotide sequence alignment of the L1 ORFs of the SsPVs showed 98.5 % similarity, classifying these viruses as SsPV type 1 ‘variants’ (SsPV-1a and -1b). Based on a concatenated alignment of the E1, E2, L1 and L2 ORFs of SsPV-1 variants a and b, and 81 other human and animal PV type species, a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. This phylogenetic analysis showed that the SsPV-1a and -1b variants did not cluster with the other PVs of artiodactyls (cloven-hoofed) host species, but clustered on the edge of the genus <jats:italic>Alphapapillomavirus</jats:italic>, very near to the root of this genus.</jats:p>",0

The establishment of the microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures is the basic 
element to investigate the role played by these regulatory molecules in the 
biology of an organism. Marek's disease virus 1 (MDV-1) is an avian herpesvirus 
that naturally infects chicken and induces T cells lymphomas. During latency, 
MDV-1, like other herpesviruses, expresses a limited subset of transcripts. 
These include three miRNA clusters. Several studies identified the expression of 
virus and host encoded miRNAs from MDV-1 infected cell cultures and chickens. 
But a high discrepancy was observed when miRNA cloning frequencies obtained from 
different cloning and sequencing protocols were compared. Thus, we analyzed the 
effect of small RNA library preparation and sequencing on the miRNA frequencies 
obtained from the same RNA samples collected during MDV-1 infection of chicken 
at different steps of the oncoviral pathogenesis. Qualitative and quantitative 
variations were found in the data, depending on the strategy used. One of the 
mature miRNA derived from the latency-associated-transcript (LAT), 
mdv1-miR-M7-5p, showed the highest variation. Its cloning frequency was 50% of 
the viral miRNA counts when a small scale sequencing approach was used. Its 
frequency was 100 times less abundant when determined through the deep 
sequencing approach. Northern blot analysis showed a better correlation with the 
miRNA frequencies found by the small scale sequencing approach. By analyzing the 
cellular miRNA repertoire, we also found a gap between the two sequencing 
approaches. Collectively, our study indicates that next-generation sequencing 
data considered alone are limited for assessing the absolute copy number of 
transcripts. Thus, the quantification of small RNA should be addressed by 
compiling data obtained by using different techniques such as microarrays, 
qRT-PCR and NB analysis in support of high throughput sequencing data. These 
observations should be considered when miRNA variations are studied prior 
addressing functional studies.

Whole Genome Sequencing demonstrates that Geographic Variation of Escherichia coli O157 Genotypes Dominates Host Association,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Genetic variation in an infectious disease pathogen can be driven by ecological niche dissimilarities arising from different host species and different geographical locations. Whole genome sequencing was used to compare <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> O157 isolates from host reservoirs (cattle and sheep) from Scotland and to compare genetic variation of isolates (human, animal, environmental/food) obtained from Scotland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada and the USA. Nei’s genetic distance calculated from core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated that the animal isolates were from the same population. Investigation of the Shiga toxin bacteriophage and their insertion sites (SBI typing) revealed that cattle and sheep isolates had statistically indistinguishable rarefaction profiles, diversity and genotypes. In contrast, isolates from different countries exhibited significant differences in Nei’s genetic distance and SBI typing. Hence, after successful international transmission, which has occurred on multiple occasions, local genetic variation occurs, resulting in a global patchwork of continental and trans-continental phylogeographic clades. These findings are important for three reasons: first, understanding transmission and evolution of infectious diseases associated with multiple host reservoirs and multi-geographic locations; second, highlighting the relevance of the sheep reservoir when considering farm based interventions; and third, improving our understanding of why human disease incidence varies across the world.</jats:p>",0
Detection and Subtyping of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus in Infected Cattle by Polymerase chain Reaction and Amplified VP1 Sequencing,<jats:p> Fast and accurate detection of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks is needed to limit spread of the disease by proper vaccination. The use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has revolutionized the way in which viral diseases are diagnosed. Sequence analysis of the amplified VP1 sequence can enable the classification of FMD virus detected in the morbid animal. PCR assays were carried out to identify the virus and its serotype in suspect animals from 2 outbreaks of FMD type O virus. Sequence analysis of the amplified VP1 cDNA showed 78% homology with O1K and over 95% homology between the samples. These findings suggest that the 2 outbreaks were due to infection with the same virus serosubtype. </jats:p>,0

Currently, there are two recognised genotypes of Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 
(BVDV), type 1 and type 2. These genotypes are divided into subtypes based on 
phylogenetic analysis, namely a-p for BVDV-1 and a-c for BVDV-2. Within this 
study, the genetic heterogeneity of BVDV-1 in England and Wales was investigated 
and compared to the situation in 1996/1997. Viral RNA was extracted from 316 
blood samples collected between 2004 and 2009 that were previously identified as 
BVDV-1 positive. A region of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) was amplified by 
RT-PCR and the PCR products were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'UTR 
demonstrated the existence of five subtypes of BVDV-1 circulating in England and 
Wales, namely BVDV-1a (244 samples), BVDV-1b (50), BVDV-1e (3), BVDV-1f (1) and 
BVDV-1i (18). Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence for the N(pro) 
region of the viral genome supported the classification obtained with the 5'UTR. 
Given the fact that only three subtypes were detected in 1999 this report 
supports the notion that the restocking of cattle from continental Europe, after 
the mass culling during the Foot-and-Mouth outbreak in 2001 and slaughter of 
cattle due to bovine tuberculosis infection, has increased the genetic diversity 
of BVDV-1 subtypes in England and Wales in the past 10 years.

DNA from a novel alphaherpesvirus was amplified from a cloacal papilloma, a 
cutaneous papilloma, and the normal cloacal mucosa of African grey parrots 
(Psittacus erithacus erithacus). Phylogenetically, the virus was most closely 
related to the psittacid herpesvirus, but demonstrated sufficient nucleotide and 
amino acid diversity to be considered a new alphaherpesvirus. It is proposed 
that the previously described psittacid herpesvirus be designated as psittacid 
herpesvirus 1 (PsHV-1), and this new species be classified as psittacid 
herpesvirus 2 (PsHV-2). It is speculated that PsHV-2 co-evolved with the African 
grey parrot and should therefore be present in these birds in the wild.

Two outbreaks of sheeppox in sheep have occurred in Gansu Province, China. The 
P32, GPCR, and RPO30 genes were used as markers for differential diagnosis. We 
confirmed that the outbreaks were caused by sheeppox virus. Sequence and 
phylogenetic analysis of the P32, GPCR, and RPO30 genes revealed a close 
relationship between the 2 isolates and Chinese sheeppox viruses. Because ill 
sheep were imported from Jingyuan, another county of Gansu Province, our results 
strongly suggest the importance of veterinary surveillance prior to 
transportation.

Characterization of H7N2 Avian Influenza Virus in Wild Birds and Pikas in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Area,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Qinghai Lake is a major migrating bird breeding site that has experienced several recent highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) epizootics. From 2006 to 2009 we studied Qinghai’s wild birds and pikas for evidence of AIV infections. We sampled 941 healthy wild animals and isolated seventeen H7N2 viruses (eight from pikas and nine from wild birds). The H7N2 viruses were phylogenetically closely related to each other and to viruses isolated in Hong Kong in the 1970s. We determined the pathogenicity of the H7N2 viruses by infecting chickens and mice. Our results suggest that pikas might play an important role in the ecology of AIVs, acting as intermediate hosts in which viruses become more adapted to mammals. Our findings of AI infection in pikas are consistent with previous observations and raise the possibility that pikas might play a previously unrecognized role in the ecology of AIVs peridomestic aquatic environments.</jats:p>",0
Overexpression of the Rybp Gene Inhibits Differentiation of Bovine Myoblasts into Myotubes,"<jats:p>RING1 and YY1 binding protein (Rybp) genes inhibit myogenesis in mice, but there are no reports on the effects of these genes in cattle. The aim of this study is to investigate the roles of the Rybp gene on bovine skeletal muscle development and myoblast differentiation. In the present study, the Rybp gene was overexpressed in bovine myoblasts via adenovirus. RNA-seq was performed to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The results showed that overexpressing the Rybp gene inhibits the formation of myotubes. The morphological differences in myoblasts began on the second day and were very significant 6 days after adenovirus induction. A total of 1311 (707 upregulated and 604 downregulated) DEGs were screened using RNA-seq between myoblasts with added negative control adenoviruses (AD-NC) and Rybp adenoviruses (AD-Rybp) after 6 days of induction. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis revealed that the downregulated DEGs were mainly involved in biological functions related to muscle, and, of the 32 pathways, those associated with muscle development were significantly enriched for the identified DEGs. This study can not only provide a theoretical basis for the regulation of skeletal muscle development in cattle by exploring the roles of the Rybp gene in myoblast differentiation, but it can also lay a theoretical foundation for molecular breeding of beef cattle.</jats:p>",0

Adeno-associated virus (AAV; genus Dependoparvovirus, family Parvoviridae) was 
first discovered in 1965 as a contaminant in adenovirus preparations. The AAVs 
are generally considered non-pathogenic, and they have the ability to attenuate 
the replication of other more pathogenic viruses, which makes them attractive as 
potential therapeutics or preventative measures. This study characterized a 
novel AAV isolated from Muscovy ducks in China. The novel virus (MHH-05-2015) 
was isolated after propagating a field isolate of the DAdV-3 virus (a type 3 
duck adenovirus) in duck embryo fibroblasts. The full genome sequence of 
MHH-05-2015 was determined, and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were 
compared to other avian AAVs. The genomic distribution of the structural and 
non-structural protein-coding genes in MHH-05-2015 was conserved and consistent 
with the other AAVs. Compared to previously isolated avian AAVs, MHH-05-2015 had 
approximately 63 to 64% sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 
MHH-05-2015 clustered separately from other avian AAVs, suggesting that 
MHH-05-2015 was not directly descended from other Dependoparvovirus family 
members. These results suggest that MHH-05-2015 is a new subtype of AAV that is 
distinct from other avian AAVs.

Viruses of the genus 'Norwalk-like viruses' (NLVs) detected in humans have been 
genetically classified into two major genetic groups, genogroups I and II (GI 
and GII), which together are made up of at least 14 genetic subgroups. However, 
a comparable classification of NLVs in other species remains to be carried out. 
We sequenced a 2-kb region from within the RNA polymerase gene to the 3' end of 
open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of two NLV strains previously detected in the caecum 
contents of healthy pigs. The sequences of the entire ORF2 of these two NLV 
strains were analyzed for their genetic relationships to 15 human strains, which 
have already been reported and used as references for the genetic classification 
of human NLV strains, and additional two strains; one, a human strain which has 
recently been reported and appears to represent a new genetic subgroup of GII; 
and the other, an animal NLV strain. Analysis of a matrix showing pairwise 
identities and topology of a neighbor-joining tree showed that the two swine 
strains could be classified into a new genetic subgroup of GII on the basis of 
the amino acid sequences of the entire capsid protein. Grouping of the two swine 
strains was well corroborated by results of similar analyses of nucleotide 
sequences of the entire ORF2 and of a 510 base region at the 3' end of ORF1.

Differentiation of respiratory syncytial virus subgroups with cDNA probes in a nucleic acid hybridization assay,"<jats:p>A new approach to respiratory syncytial (RS) virus subgroup determination was developed by using a simple nucleic acid filter hybridization technique. By this method, virus-infected cells are bound and fixed in a single step, and the viral RNA in the fixed-cell preparation is characterized directly by its ability to hybridize to cDNA probes specific for either the A or B subgroups of RS virus. The subgroup-specific probes were constructed from cDNA clones that corresponded to a portion of the extracellular domain of the RS virus G protein of either a subgroup B RS virus (8/60) or a subgroup A RS virus (A2). The cDNA probes were labeled with 32P and used to analyze RS virus isolates collected over a period of three decades. Replicate templates of infected cell preparations were hybridized with either the subgroup A or B probe. The subgroup assignments of 40 viruses tested by nucleic acid hybridization were in agreement with the results of subgroup determinations based on their reactivities with monoclonal antibodies, which previously has been the only method available for determining the subgroup classification of RS virus isolates. The nucleic acid hybridization assay has the advantage of providing broad-based discrimination of the two subgroups on the basis of nucleic acid homology, irrespective of minor antigenic differences that are detected in assays in which monoclonal antibodies are used. The nucleic acid hybridization technique provides a reliable method for RS virus subgroup characterization.</jats:p>",0

Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) infect humans and a wide range of animals and may cause 
diarrhea. The aim of this study was to investigate PBV infection and its 
association with diarrhea. Here, seven PBV RT-PCR-positive fecal samples from 
diarrheic children and four fecal samples from healthy children as controls were 
analyzed by viral metagenomics. The results indicated that all the seven 
diarrheic fecal samples contain high titers of PBV sequences, while three of the 
controls were negative, and one had low titers of PBV. Three of the diarrheic 
fecal samples were also positive for other viruses, including anellovirus, human 
gyrovirus, human parechovirus, and porcine stool-associated circular virus. PBV 
sequences from the seven patients were assembled, generating seven large contigs 
with the complete ORF of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Phylogenetic 
analysis of the amino acid sequences of RdRp indicated that the seven PBVs in 
the present study belonged to three different genogroups. Our data suggest that 
PBV might have been the cause of diarrhea in these seven children.

Epidemiological and genetic characteristics of swine pseudorabies virus in mainland China between 2012 and 2017,"<jats:p>The outbreak of pseudorabies (PR) in many Bartha-K61 vaccinated farms in China in late 2011 has seriously damaged the pig industry of one of the largest producers of pork products in the world. To understand the epidemiological characteristics of the pseudorabies virus (PRV) strains currently prevalent in China, a total of 16,256 samples collected from pig farms suspected of PRV infection in 27 Provinces of China between 2012 and 2017 were evaluated for detection of PRV. Since the extensive use of gE-deleted PRV vaccine in China, the PRV-gE was applied for determining wild-type virus infection by PCR. Of the 16,256 samples detected, approximately 1,345 samples were positive for the detection of PRV-gE, yielding an average positive rate of 8.27%. The positive rates of PRV detection from 2012 to 2017 were 11.92% (153/1284), 12.19% (225/1846), 6.70% (169/2523), 11.10% (269/2424), 5.57% (147/2640), and 6.90% (382/5539), respectively. To understand the genetic characteristics of the PRV strains currently circulating, 25 PRV strains isolated from those PRV-gE positive samples were selected for further investigation. Phylogenetic analysis based on gB, gC, and gE showed that PRV strains prevalent in China had a remarkably distinct evolutionary relationship with PRVs from other countries, which might explain the observation that Bartha-K61 vaccine was unable to provide full protection against emergent strains. Sequence alignments identified many amino acid changes within the gB, gC, and gE proteins of the PRVs circulating in China after the outbreak compared to those from other countries or those prevalent in China before the outbreak; those changes also might affect the protective efficacy of previously used vaccines in China, as well as being associated in part with the increased virulence of the current PRV epidemic strains in China.</jats:p>",0

Pigs are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses and therefore 
have been proposed to be mixing vessels for the generation of pandemic influenza 
viruses through reassortment. In this study, for the first time, we report the 
isolation and genetic analyses of three novel triple-reassortant H1N1 swine 
influenza viruses from pigs in Tianjin, Northern China. Phylogenetic analysis 
showed that these novel viruses contained genes from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 
(PB2, PB1, PA and NP), Eurasian swine (HA, NA and M) and triple-reassortant 
swine (NS) lineages. This indicated that the reassortment among the 2009 
pandemic H1N1, Eurasian swine and triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses had 
taken place in pigs in Tianjin and resulted in the generation of new viruses. 
Furthermore, three human-like H1N1, two classical swine H1N1 and two Eurasian 
swine H1N1 viruses were also isolated during the swine influenza virus 
surveillance from 2009 to 2013, which indicated that multiple genetic lineages 
of swine H1N1 viruses were co-circulating in the swine population in Tianjin, 
China. The emergence of novel triple-reassortant H1N1 swine influenza viruses 
may be a potential threat to human health and emphasizes the importance of 
further continuous surveillance.

Separate Evolution of Virulent Newcastle Disease Viruses from Mexico and Central America,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>An outbreak of Newcastle disease (ND) in poultry was reported in Belize in 2008. The characteristics of three virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates from this outbreak (NDV-Belize-3/08, NDV-Belize-4/08, and NDV-Belize-12/08) were assessed by genomic analysis and by clinicopathological characterization in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. The results showed that all three strains belong to NDV genotype V and are virulent, as assessed by the intracerebral pathogenicity index and the polybasic amino acid sequence at the fusion protein cleavage site. In 4-week-old SPF chickens, NDV-Belize-3/08 behaved as a typical velogenic viscerotropic NDV strain, causing severe necrohemorrhagic lesions in the lymphoid organs, with systemic virus distribution. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple NDV genotype V representatives revealed that genotype V can be divided into three subgenotypes, namely, Va, Vb, and Vc, and that all tested Belizean isolates belong to subgenotype Vb. Furthermore, these isolates are nearly identical to a 2007 isolate from Honduras and appear to have evolved separately from other contemporary viruses circulating in Mexico, clustering into a new clade within NDV subgenotype Vb.</jats:p>",0

This report describes a study that provides evidence of HEV transmission from 
pigs to humans in Thailand by applying molecular genetics analysis. It was found 
that viruses recovered from Thai patients are closely related to genotype 3 and 
swine hepatitis E virus in Thailand. Based on analysis of a 302-base-pair ORF2 
fragment, the strains investigated belong to subgroup 3e and are closely related 
to European strains. Based on the results obtained, swine are suspected to be a 
source of HEV transmission to humans in Thailand.

The origin of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is not fully understood, but it is 
considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen. To date, HEV has been isolated from 
many animal species. The family Hepeviridae consists of two genera. The genus 
Orthohepevirus includes four distinct species (A, B, C, and D), each with 
distinct genotypes. Within the Orthohepevirus A species, HEV-1 and HEV-2 host 
ranges are restricted to humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 primarily infect a 
wide range of diverse animal species, in addition to being zoonotic to humans. 
Swine and wild boar species were previously thought to be the primary natural 
HEV reservoir, but recently rabbits have also been identified as major carriers. 
Moreover, increasing the number of HEV infections within the food supply chain 
underscore the important role of farming and food processing practices in 
limiting virus transmission. Notably, a Chinese commercial vaccine has the 
potential to protect humans and possibly animal reservoirs from HEV infection. 
This review summarizes the status of HEV infection worldwide in different animal 
species and outlines various modes of zoonotic transmission, with reference to 
cross-species transmission and recent vaccine developments.

Alphaherpesviruses are widespread in the human population, and include herpes 
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2, and varicella zoster virus (VZV). These viral 
pathogens cause epithelial lesions, and then infect the nervous system to cause 
lifelong latency, reactivation, and spread. A related veterinary herpesvirus, 
pseudorabies (PRV), causes similar disease in livestock that result in 
significant economic losses. Vaccines developed for VZV and PRV serve as useful 
models for the development of an HSV-1 vaccine. We present full genome sequence 
comparisons of the PRV vaccine strain Bartha, and two virulent PRV isolates, 
Kaplan and Becker. These genome sequences were determined by high-throughput 
sequencing and assembly, and present new insights into the attenuation of a 
mammalian alphaherpesvirus vaccine strain. We find many previously unknown 
coding differences between PRV Bartha and the virulent strains, including 
changes to the fusion proteins gH and gB, and over forty other viral proteins. 
Inter-strain variation in PRV protein sequences is much closer to levels 
previously observed for HSV-1 than for the highly stable VZV proteome. Almost 
20% of the PRV genome contains tandem short sequence repeats (SSRs), a class of 
nucleic acids motifs whose length-variation has been associated with changes in 
DNA binding site efficiency, transcriptional regulation, and protein 
interactions. We find SSRs throughout the herpesvirus family, and provide the 
first global characterization of SSRs in viruses, both within and between 
strains. We find SSR length variation between different isolates of PRV and 
HSV-1, which may provide a new mechanism for phenotypic variation between 
strains. Finally, we detected a small number of polymorphic bases within each 
plaque-purified PRV strain, and we characterize the effect of passage and 
plaque-purification on these polymorphisms. These data add to growing evidence 
that even plaque-purified stocks of stable DNA viruses exhibit limited sequence 
heterogeneity, which likely seeds future strain evolution.

A New Microplate Neutralization Test for Typing of Herpes Simplex Virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A microplate serum neutralization test for estimation of complement‐requiring neutralizing (CRN) antibody was established as the first step for simplification of typing of herpes simplex virus (HSV). When guinea pigs were immunized with type 2 HSV, the late sera could mostly differentiate the types of HSV better than hyperimmune rabbit sera, the CRN titer against the heterologous type 1 HSV being much lower than the homologous titer. Sera of guinea pigs immunized with type 1 HSV showed about the same level of cross reaction against type 2 HSV as did rabbit antisera. Guinea pig sera having minimal levels of cross reaction were selected, and their high dilution (1:160) and complement were added to serial 10‐fold dilutions of virus in the microplate titration of virus infectivity. Selective reduction of virus titer by either antiserum could determine the type of HSV. No equivocal intermediate case was found among a number of stock strains including many fresh isolates. The typing result coincided with that determined by a modification of Yang et al's method based on virus titers obtained with Vero and primary chick embryo cells. The typing based on plaquing in chick embryo cells sometimes failed to identify type 1 HSV.</jats:p>",0

Phylogenetic analyses of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were performed based 
on the nucleotide sequences of the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) and E2-coding 
gene. Thirty-six BVDV detected from naturally infected cattle in the northern 
region of Japan were divided into three genotypes, BVDV1a, BVDV1b and BVDV2, in 
a 5'-UTR phylogenetic tree. In a phylogenetic tree constructed from the 
E2-coding gene, BVDV1c was identified and the viruses classified in BVDV1c were 
included in BVDV1a in the 5'-UTR phylogenetic tree. Moreover, BVDV1a and BVDV1b 
in the E2-phylogenetic tree clustered closer together than in the 5'-UTR tree. 
These results suggested that phylogenetic analysis of the E2 gene was more 
useful for identification of subgenotypes within BVDV1.

Although a consensus classification system for hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 
is currently unavailable, HEV variants (JBOAR135-Shiz09 and wbJOY_06) from wild 
boars (Sus scrofa leucomystax) have provisionally been classified into two novel 
genotypes (5 and 6). While performing a survey of HEV infections among 566 wild 
boars that were captured in Japan between January 2010 and August 2013, we found 
24 boars (4.2%) with ongoing HEV infections: 13 had genotype 3 HEV, 10 had 
genotype 4 HEV and the remaining boar possessed a novel HEV variant (designated 
wbJNN_13). The entire wbJNN_13 genome comprised 7247 nucleotides excluding the 
poly(A) tail, and was highly divergent from known genotype 1 to 4 HEV isolates 
derived from humans, swine, wild boars, deer, mongoose and rabbits by 
22.4-28.2%, JBOAR135-Shiz09 and wbJOY_06 by 19.6-21.9% and rat, ferret, bat and 
avian HEV isolates by 40.9-46.1% over the entire genome. Phylogenetic trees 
confirmed that wbJNN_13 is distantly related to all known HEV isolates. A 
Simplot analysis revealed no significant recombination among the existing HEV 
strains. These results indicate the presence of at least three genetic lineages 
of presumably boar-indigenous HEV strains. Further studies to fully understand 
the extent of the genomic heterogeneity of HEV variants infecting wild boars are 
warranted.

The wide distribution of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses is a 
global threat to human health. Indonesia has had the largest number of human 
infections and fatalities caused by these viruses. To understand the enzootic 
conditions of the viruses in Indonesia, twenty-four H5N1 viruses isolated from 
poultry from 2003 to 2007 were phylogenetically characterized. Although previous 
studies exclusively classified the Indonesian viruses into clades 2.1.1-2.1.3, 
our phylogenetic analyses showed a new sublineage that did not belong to any of 
the present clades. In addition, novel reassortant viruses were identified that 
emerged between this new sublineage and other clades in 2005-2006 on Java 
Island. H5N1 viruses were introduced from Java Island to Sulawesi, Kalimantan, 
and Sumatra Island on multiple occasions from 2003-2007, causing the 
geographical expansion of these viruses in Indonesia. These findings identify 
Java Island as the epicenter of the Indonesian H5N1 virus expansion.

Influenza A Viruses of Swine (IAV-S) in Vietnam from 2010 to 2015: Multiple Introductions of A(H1N1)pdm09 Viruses into the Pig Population and Diversifying Genetic Constellations of Enzootic IAV-S,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Active surveillance of influenza A viruses of swine (IAV-S) involving 262 farms and 10 slaughterhouses in seven provinces in northern and southern Vietnam from 2010 to 2015 yielded 388 isolates from 32 farms; these viruses were classified into H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes. Whole-genome sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates represented 15 genotypes, according to the genetic constellation of the eight segments. All of the H1N1 viruses were entirely A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, whereas all of the H1N2 and H3N2 viruses were reassortants among 5 distinct ancestral viruses: H1 and H3 triple-reassortant (TR) IAV-S that originated from North American pre-2009 human seasonal H1, human seasonal H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Notably, 93% of the reassortant IAV-S retained M genes that were derived from A(H1N1)pdm09, suggesting some advantage in terms of their host adaptation. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that multiple introductions of A(H1N1)pdm09 and TR IAV-S into the Vietnamese pig population have driven the genetic diversity of currently circulating Vietnamese IAV-S. In addition, our results indicate that a reassortant IAV-S with human-like H3 and N2 genes and an A(H1N1)pdm09 origin M gene likely caused a human case in Ho Chi Minh City in 2010. Our current findings indicate that human-to-pig transmission as well as cocirculation of different IAV-S have contributed to diversifying the gene constellations of IAV-S in Vietnam.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            This comprehensive genetic characterization of 388 influenza A viruses of swine (IAV-S) isolated through active surveillance of Vietnamese pig farms from 2010 through 2015 provides molecular epidemiological insight into the genetic diversification of IAV-S in Vietnam after the emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Multiple reassortments among A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and enzootic IAV-S yielded 14 genotypes, 9 of which carried novel gene combinations. The reassortants that carried M genes derived from A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses became predominant, replacing those of the IAV-S that had been endemic in Vietnam since 2011. Notably, one of the novel reassortants likely caused a human case in Vietnam. Given that Vietnam is the second-largest pig-producing country in Asia, continued monitoring of IAV-S is highly important from the viewpoints of both the swine industry and human public health.

A unique European-type HEV strain (HE-JA12-0725) classifiable into subgenotype 
3f was recovered from a 66-year-old Japanese female with autochthonous acute 
hepatitis E, and its entire genomic sequence was determined and characterized. 
The HE-JA12-0725 strain shared the highest identity of 92.7% with a Spanish 
swine isolate (EU723514) over the entire genome and possessed a long 
hypervariable region sequence of 111 amino acids, identical to the 3f strains of 
European origin. The patient had consumed pork liver obtained via home delivery 
in Japan approximately two months before the disease onset. These results 
suggest the circulation of rare 3f HEV strains in Japan.

BACKGROUND: Avian avulavirus-1 (AAvV-1, previously Newcastle Disease Virus) is 
responsible for poultry and wild birds' disease outbreaks. Numerous whole genome 
sequencing methods were reported for this virus. These methods included cloning, 
specific primers amplification, shotgun PCR approaches, Sequence Independent 
Single Primer Amplification and next generation sequencing platform kits.
METHODS: Three methods were used to sequence 173 Israeli Avian avulavirus-1 
field isolates and one vaccine strain (VH). The sequencing was performed on 
Proton and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine and to a lesser extent, Illumina 
MiSeq and NextSeq sequencers. Target specific primers (SP) and Sequence 
Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) products sequenced via the Ion 
torrent sequencer had a high error rate and truncated genomes. All the next 
generation sequencing platform sequencing kits generated high sequence accuracy 
and near-complete genomic size.
RESULTS: A high level of mutations was observed in the intergenic regions 
between the avian avulavirus-1 genes. Within genes, multiple regions are more 
mutated than the Fusion region currently used for typing.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the whole genome sequencing by the Ion 
torrent sequencing kit is sufficient. However, when higher fidelity is desired, 
the Illumina NextSeq and Proton torrent sequencing kits were found to be 
preferable.

Evaluation of the Broad-Range PCR-Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) System and Virus Microarrays for Virus Detection,"<jats:p>Advanced nucleic acid-based technologies are powerful research tools for novel virus discovery but need to be standardized for broader applications such as virus detection in biological products and clinical samples. We have used well-characterized retrovirus stocks to evaluate the limit of detection (LOD) for broad-range PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS or PLEX-ID), RT-PCR assays, and virus microarrays. The results indicated that in the absence of background cellular nucleic acids, PLEX-ID and RT-PCR had a similar LOD for xenotropic murine retrovirus-related virus (XMRV; 3.12 particles per µL) whereas sensitivity of virus detection was 10-fold greater using virus microarrays. When virus was spiked into a background of cellular nucleic acids, the LOD using PLEX-ID remained the same, whereas virus detection by RT-PCR was 10-fold less sensitive, and no virus could be detected by microarrays. Expected endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences were detected in cell lines tested and known species-specific viral sequences were detected in bovine serum and porcine trypsin. A follow-up strategy was developed using PCR amplification, nucleotide sequencing, and bioinformatics to demonstrate that an RD114-like retrovirus sequence that was detected by PLEX-ID in canine cell lines (Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Cf2Th canine thymus) was due to defective, endogenous gammaretrovirus-related sequences.</jats:p>",0

In the spring of 2014 infectious bursal disease (IBD) was confirmed in a Finnish 
layer flock exhibiting clinical signs and increased mortality. Organ and blood 
samples were sent for diagnosis to the Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira. IBD 
virus (IBDV) was detected in RT-PCR studies. Altogether hens from six layer 
farms associated with increased mortality (7-10%, worst case 30%) were diagnosed 
with IBD during 2014. Antibodies were also detected with IBD-ELISA tests in hens 
on two farms. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the causative agent of the 2014 
IBD outbreak was a non-reassortant very virulent type IBDV. The representative 
virus strains from previous IBD outbreaks in 1978, 1987 and 1993 were also 
included in the analysis. The strains isolated in 2014 and 1993 were very 
similar indicating circulation of a very virulent IBDV for over 20 years in the 
country. In spite of the comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, the definitive 
origin of the viruses from 2014 and previous outbreaks remains unclear.

Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) has emerged as the most important cause of large 
outbreaks of severe and sometimes fatal hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) 
across the Asia-Pacific region. EV-A71 outbreaks have been associated with 
(sub)genogroup switches, sometimes accompanied by recombination events. 
Understanding EV-A71 population dynamics is therefore essential for 
understanding this emerging infection, and may provide pivotal information for 
vaccine development. Despite the public health burden of EV-A71, relatively few 
EV-A71 complete-genome sequences are available for analysis and from limited 
geographical localities. The availability of an efficient procedure for 
whole-genome sequencing would stimulate effort to generate more viral sequence 
data. Herein, we report for the first time the development of a next-generation 
sequencing based protocol for whole-genome sequencing of EV-A71 directly from 
clinical specimens. We were able to sequence viruses of subgenogroup C4 and B5, 
while RNA from culture materials of diverse EV-A71 subgenogroups belonging to 
both genogroup B and C was successfully amplified. The nature of intra-host 
genetic diversity was explored in 22 clinical samples, revealing 107 positions 
carrying minor variants (ranging from 0 to 15 variants per sample). Our analysis 
of EV-A71 strains sampled in 2013 showed that they all belonged to subgenogroup 
B5, representing the first report of this subgenogroup in Vietnam. In 
conclusion, we have successfully developed a high-throughput next-generation 
sequencing-based assay for whole-genome sequencing of EV-A71 from clinical 
samples.

Suppression of Coronavirus Replication by Cyclophilin Inhibitors,"<jats:p>Coronaviruses infect a variety of mammalian and avian species and cause serious diseases in humans, cats, mice, and birds in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), mouse hepatitis, and avian infectious bronchitis, respectively. No effective vaccine or treatment has been developed for SARS-coronavirus or FIP virus, both of which cause lethal diseases. It has been reported that a cyclophilin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), could inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. CsA is a well-known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cellular cyclophilins to inhibit calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific phosphatase. The inhibition of calcineurin blocks the translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells from the cytosol into the nucleus, thus preventing the transcription of genes encoding cytokines such as interleukin-2. Cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl isomerases with physiological functions that have been described for many years to include chaperone and foldase activities. Also, many viruses require cyclophilins for replication; these include human immunodeficiency virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and hepatitis C virus. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the suppression of viral replication differ for different viruses. This review describes the suppressive effects of CsA on coronavirus replication.</jats:p>",0

Modern laboratory techniques for the detection of novel human viruses are 
greatly needed as physicians and epidemiologists increasingly deal with 
infectious diseases caused by new or previously unrecognized pathogens. There 
are many clinical syndromes in which viruses are suspected to play a role, but 
for which traditional microbiology techniques routinely fail in uncovering the 
etiologic agent. In addition, new viruses continue to challenge the human 
population owing to the encroachment of human settlements into animal and 
livestock habitats, globalization, climate change, growing numbers of 
immunocompromised people and bioterrorism. Metagenomics-based tools, such as 
microarrays and high-throughput sequencing are ideal for responding to these 
challenges. Pan-viral microarrays, containing representative sequences from all 
known viruses, have been used to detect novel and distantly-related variants of 
known viruses. Sequencing-based methods have also been successfully employed to 
detect novel viruses and have the potential to detect the full spectrum of 
viruses, including those present in low numbers.

In order to identify the patterns of genetic change of Japanese encephalitis 
virus (JEV) strains circulating in Oita, the complete envelope (E) gene has been 
sequenced for 35 isolates from swine in a 30-year span. Based on nucleotide and 
deduced amino acid sequences, the genetic variation was examined, phylogeny was 
estimated and selection pressures were also analyzed. This study demonstrated 
that the major genotype (G) of JEV isolates had shifted from GIII to GI in the 
mid-1990s in Oita. The intensities of selection acting on the Oita GIII and GI 
strains were found to be almost same. It suggests that the intensity of 
selection might not be the reason for such a genotype shift observed in Oita. 
Pairwise comparisons revealed the high conservation of the E gene at the protein 
level. Compared with the Oita GIII strains, all the Oita GI strains shared four 
amino acid changes at E129 (T-M), E222 (A-S), E327 (S-T) and E366 (A-S). Among 
all 70 JEV isolates involved in this paper, the GI strains shared only one amino 
acid change at E222 (A-S) in comparison with the GIII strains. No strong 
evidence for positive selection was found, the JEV evolution has generally been 
subject to strong purifying selection, but one ongoing evolutionary pathway was 
found to be under relaxed purifying selection in Oita. This study is a localized 
example of JEV molecular evolution in nature.

Detection and characterization of two co-infection variant strains of avian orthoreovirus (ARV) in young layer chickens using next-generation sequencing (NGS),"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) for full genomic characterization studies of the newly emerging avian orthoreovirus (ARV) field strains isolated in Pennsylvania poultry, we identified two co-infection ARV variant strains from one ARV isolate obtained from ARV-affected young layer chickens. The de novo assembly of the ARV reads generated 19 contigs of two different ARV variant strains according to 10 genome segments of each ARV strain. The two variants had the same M2 segment. The complete genomes of each of the two variant strains were 23,493 bp in length and 10 dsRNA segments ranged from 1192 bp (S4) to 3958 bp (L1), encoding 12 viral proteins. Sequence comparison of nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequences of all 10 genome segments revealed 58.1–100% and 51.4–100% aa identity between the two variant strains and 54.3–89.4% and 49.5–98.1% aa identity between the two variants and classic vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a moderate to significant nt sequence divergence between the two variant and ARV reference strains. These findings have demonstrated the first naturally occurring co-infection of two ARV variants in commercial young layer chickens, providing scientific evidence that multiple ARV strains can be simultaneously present in one host species of chickens.</jats:p>",0

By using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, we have identified a 
divergent avian orthoreovirus (ARV) field variant (Reo/PA/Broiler/15511/13, or 
PA15511), isolated from broiler chickens with viral arthritis in Pennsylvania in 
2013. The complete genome of the PA15511 field strain was 23,495 bp in length 
with 10 dsRNA segments encoding 12 viral proteins. The lengths of the genomic 
segments ranged from 1192 bp (S4) to 3958 bp (L1). Genomic analysis has revealed 
that this virus is distinct from reference ARV strains and meets criteria for a 
new or novel strain.

Combining Comprehensive Analysis of Off-Site Lambda Phage Integration with a CRISPR-Based Means of Characterizing Downstream Physiology,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            During its lysogenic life cycle, the phage genome is integrated into the host chromosome by site-specific recombination. In this report, we analyze lambda phage integration into noncanonical sites using next-generation sequencing and show that it generates significant genetic diversity by targeting over 300 unique sites in the host
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            genome. Moreover, these integration events can have important phenotypic consequences for the host, including changes in cell motility and increased antibiotic resistance. Importantly, the new technologies that we developed to enable this study—sequencing secondary sites using next-generation sequencing and then selecting relevant lysogens using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-based selection—are broadly applicable to other phage-bacterium systems.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Bacteriophages play an important role in bacterial evolution through lysogeny, where the phage genome is integrated into the host chromosome. While phage integration generally occurs at a specific site in the host chromosome, it is also known to occur at other, so-called secondary sites. In this study, we developed a new experimental technology to comprehensively study secondary integration sites and discovered that phage can integrate into over 300 unique sites in the host genome, resulting in significant genetic diversity in bacteria. We further developed an assay to examine the phenotypic consequence of such diverse integration events and found that phage integration can cause changes in evolutionarily relevant traits such as bacterial motility and increases in antibiotic resistance. Importantly, our method is readily applicable to other phage-bacterium systems.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), normally a soil commensal, is an important 
opportunistic pathogen in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and non-Cystic Fibrosis 
Bronchiectasis (nCFBR). Persistent infection correlates with accelerated decline 
in lung function and early mortality. The horizontal transfer of DNA by 
temperate bacteriophages can add gene function and selective advantages to their 
bacterial host within the constrained environment of the lower lung. In this 
study, we chemically induce temperate bacteriophages from clonal cultures of Pa 
and identify their mixed viral communities employing metagenomic approaches. We 
compared 92 temperate phage metagenomes stratified from these clinical 
backgrounds (47 CF and 45 nCFBR Pa isolates) using MG-RAST and GeneWise2. KEGG 
analysis shows the complexity of temperate phage accessory gene carriage 
increases with duration and severity of the disease. Furthermore, we identify 
the presence of Ig-like motifs within phage structural genes linked to bacterial 
adhesion and carbohydrate binding including Big_2, He_Pig, and Fn3. This study 
provides the first clinical support to the proposed bacteriophage adherence to 
mucus (BAM) model and the evolution of phages interacting at these mucosal 
surfaces over time.

Viral Metagenomics on Animals as a Tool for the Detection of Zoonoses Prior to Human Infection?,"<jats:p>Many human viral infections have a zoonotic, i.e., wild or domestic animal, origin. Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly via contact with an animal or indirectly via exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of  a bloodsucking arthropod. If a virus is able to adapt and replicate in its new human host, human-to-human transmissions may occur, possibly resulting in an epidemic, such as  the A/H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. Thus, predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important challenge for public health officials in the coming decades. The recent development of viral metagenomics, i.e., the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or an environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, is promising for the surveillance of such diseases and can be accomplished by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and arthropods that are closely in contact with humans. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity within such animals (in particular blood-feeding arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present its possible future application for the surveillance of zoonotic and arboviral diseases.</jats:p>",0

Faustovirus, a new Asfarviridae-related giant virus, was recently isolated in 
Vermamoeba vermiformis, a protist found in sewage water in various geographical 
locations and occasionally reported in human eye infection cases. As part of a 
global metagenomic analysis of viral communities existing in biting midges, we 
report here for the first time the identification and isolation of a 
Faustovirus-like virus in hematophagous arthropods and its detection in their 
animal hosts. The DNA virome analysis of three pools of Culicoides sp., engorged 
female Culicoides imicola and non-engorged male/female C. imicola biting midges 
collected in Senegal, revealed the presence of amoeba-infecting giant viruses 
and, among them, a majority of sequences related to Faustovirus. Phylogenetic 
analyses conducted on several structural genes of Faustovirus confirmed the 
clustering of the arthropod-borne Faustovirus with sewage-borne Faustoviruses, 
with a distinct geographical clustering of Senegalese Faustovirus strains. 
Transmission electron microscopy identified viral particles with morphologies 
and diameters which were compatible with Faustovirus. The presence of infectious 
arthropod-borne Faustovirus was finally confirmed by successful isolation on V. 
vermiformis amoeba. Global proteomic analysis of biting midges identified that 
arthropods' blood meal originating from cattle, rodents and humans. Further 
screening of cattle sera and rodent tissue resulted in prevalence of Faustovirus 
being estimated at 38% in rodents and 14% in cattle, suggesting a possible 
origin of Faustovirus presence in arthropods via the ingestion of contaminated 
blood meal. Viral loads were the highest in rodents' urine and kidney samples, 
suggesting a possible excretion of viral particles into the environment. 
Faustovirus DNA polymerase-related sequences were also detected in more than 9 
and 11% of febrile patients and healthy Senegalese human sera, respectively. Our 
study thus, highlights the need to investigate the role of arthropods, wildlife, 
and domestic animals in the lifecycle of amoeba-infecting giant viruses and, in 
particular, the environmental cycle of Faustovirus.

poxvirus was isolated from the lesions (upper beak) of the affected birds and 
was genetically characterized by polymerase chain reaction, nucleotide 
sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the 
virus isolated from these flamingos was genetically close to those isolated from 
pigeons, suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmission.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are becoming increasingly 
accessible, leading to an expanded interest in the composition of the porcine 
enteric virome. In the present study, the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic 
Belgian piglet was determined. Although the virome of only a single piglet was 
analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete 
genome of a pig group C rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly 
related to the only other completely characterized pig RVC strain, Cowden. Its 
relatedness to RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed and the 
porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in 
humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the 
rare porcine G3 genotype, which might be serologically distinct from most other 
pig RVC strains. A putative novel RVC VP6 genotype was identified as well. A 
group A rotavirus strain also present in this fecal sample contained the rare 
pig genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical 
pig RVA genotypes I5, A8, and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1, 
and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the fecal virome of the piglet also 
contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, of which the complete genomes were 
characterized. Results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be 
present simultaneously in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets. In this study, 
these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease, but still they 
might have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance. The 
fast evolution of NGS will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in 
veterinary practice. Its application will certainly lead to better insights into 
the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections, that may have 
remained unnoticed using traditional diagnostic techniques. This will stimulate 
the development of new and durable prophylactic measures to improve pig health 
and production.

Nanopore sequencing as a revolutionary diagnostic tool for porcine viral enteric disease complexes identifies porcine kobuvirus as an important enteric virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Enteric diseases in swine are often caused by different pathogens and thus metagenomics are a useful tool for diagnostics. The capacities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics were investigated here. First, cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were already detected at 7 seconds after start of sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3 h. Next, diarrheic feces of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed. Almost all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages, which may have reshaped the piglet’s microbiome. Contigs matched <jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Escherichia</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Enterococcus</jats:italic> phages. Moreover, porcine kobuvirus was discovered in the feces for the first time in Belgium. Suckling piglets shed kobuvirus from one week of age, but an association between peak of viral shedding (10<jats:sup>6.42</jats:sup>–10<jats:sup>7.01</jats:sup> copies/swab) and diarrheic signs was not observed during a follow-up study. Retrospective analysis showed the widespread (n = 25, 56.8% positive) of genetically moderately related kobuviruses among Belgian diarrheic piglets. MinION enables rapid detection of enteric viruses. Such new methodologies will change diagnostics, but more extensive validations should be conducted. The true enteric pathogenicity of porcine kobuvirus should be questioned, while its subclinical importance cannot be excluded.</jats:p>",0

Zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is of special concern, 
particularly in high income countries were waterborne infections are less 
frequent than in developing countries. High HEV seroprevalences can be found in 
European pig populations. The aims of this study were to obtain prevalence data 
on HEV infection in swine in Belgium and to phylogenetically compare Belgian 
human HEV sequences with those obtained from swine. An ELISA screening 
prevalence of 73% (95% CI 68.8-77.5) was determined in Belgian pigs and a part 
of the results were re-evaluated by Western blot (WB). A receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis was performed and scenarios varying the ELISA 
specificity relative to WB were analysed. The seroprevalences estimated by the 
different scenarios ranged between 69 and 81% and are in agreement with the high 
exposure of the European pig population to HEV. Pig HEV sequences were 
genetically compared to those detected in humans in Belgium and a predominance 
of genotype 3 subtype f was shown in both swine and humans. The high HEV 
seroprevalence in swine and the close phylogenetic relationships between pig and 
human HEV sequences further support the risk for zoonotic transmission of HEV 
between humans and pigs.

Bovine herpesvirus type 4 (BHV-4) is a ubiquitous virus of cattle. Its genome is 
a 144 +/- 6 kb double-stranded DNA consisting of a unique central part (L-DNA) 
flanked at both ends by tandem repeats called polyrepetitive DNA (prDNA or 
H-DNA). The overall arrangement of genes has been obtained by the analysis of 
homologies between short BHV-4 DNA sequences and corresponding genes of 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpesvirus saimiri (HVS). The gene expression is 
temporally regulated. Glycoprotein precursor p (gp10/gp17) is expressed as gamma 
1 polypeptide. Glycoproteins gp1, gp8, gp11 and their precursors are gamma 2 
proteins. The analysis of strain variations allows the definition of two types 
of strains, based on the DNA patterns: the Movar 33/63-like and the DN 599-like 
strains. Only the M40 strain, isolated in India, fails to fit this 
classification. The genomic variations have been compiled to build a dendrogram 
showing three levels of divergence between BHV-4 strains or isolates. The 
available molecular data indicate that the BHV-4 genome shares much similarity 
with the DNA of EBV and HVS, two representative members of the 
gammaherpesvirinae. BHV-4 may therefore be classified in the subfamily 
gammaherpesvirinae.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is classified into 
two genotypes, type 1 and type 2, which share only about 60% genetic identity. 
Here, we report viable chimeric viruses in which the envelope protein genes from 
ORF2a to ORF5 of vSHE (type 1) were swapped into the genetic backbone of vAPRRS 
(type 2). We found that the envelope proteins of genotype 1 were fully 
functional in genotype 2 PRRSV, and the rescued chimeric progeny viruses showed 
robust genetic stability and similar replication properties to the parental 
strains in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the 
substitution of complete ORFs between different genotypes of porcine 
arterivirus. These findings pave the way to further elucidate the 
structure-function relationship of PRRSV envelope proteins, and may enable the 
development of novel marker vaccines that can be used to differentiate 
vaccinated from infected animals.

The genes for the E2 envelope protein, which elicits virus-neutralizing 
antibodies, from members of the newly described group II of bovine viral 
diarrhea viruses (BVDVs) were cloned and sequenced. These BVDVs included a 
thrombocytopenic strain from the United States, a fetal bovine serum 
contaminant, a strain from Western Canada, and two highly virulent strains, 
causing high mortality rates, from Quebec. The nucleotide and amino acid 
sequences of these E2s had only a 60-65% homology with group I BVDV E2s but >90% 
homology with the E2 of a subgroup of sheep border disease viruses. The E2 gene 
of the NADL strain was expressed and monospecific antibodies were raised in 
calves and rabbits. The virus-neutralizing titers of these antisera were 15- to 
80-fold lower for the heterologous group of BVDVs as compared to those for the 
homologous BVDVs.

Bovine ephemeral fever virus is a member of the family Rhabdoviridae and bovine 
ephemeral fever has frequently affected cattle population in Taiwan since 1967. 
During the outbreaks in 2013 and 2014, exotic bovine ephemeral fever viruses 
were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide 
sequencing. Sequence comparison showed that the exotic viruses shared 99.0-99.4% 
nucleotide identities (99.4-100.0% amino acid identities) with Chinese viruses 
and, on the contrary, 96.2-97.2% nucleotide identities (97.8-98.6% amino acid 
identities) with indigenous Taiwanese viruses. Additionally, our phylogenetic 
analysis also supported that the newly invaded bovine ephemeral fever viruses 
were closely related to the Chinese strains. These exotic 2013-2014 viruses have 
become prevalent and displaced indigenous virus strains since their appearance.

"An extensive repertoire of type III secretion effectors in

            Several pathogenic strains of
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            exploit type III secretion to inject “effector proteins” into human cells, which then subvert eukaryotic cell biology to the bacterium's advantage. We have exploited bioinformatics and experimental approaches to establish that the effector repertoire in the Sakai strain of enterohemorrhagic
            <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
            (EHEC) O157:H7 is much larger than previously thought. Homology searches led to the identification of &gt;60 putative effector genes. Thirteen of these were judged to be likely pseudogenes, whereas 49 were judged to be potentially functional. In total, 39 proteins were confirmed experimentally as effectors: 31 through proteomics and 28 through translocation assays. At the protein level, the EHEC effector sequences fall into &gt;20 families. The largest family, the NleG family, contains 14 members in the Sakai strain alone. EHEC also harbors functional homologs of effectors from plant pathogens (HopPtoH, HopW, AvrA) and from
            <jats:italic>Shigella</jats:italic>
            (OspD, OspE, OspG), and two additional members of the Map/IpgB family. Genes encoding proven or predicted effectors occur in &gt;20 exchangeable effector loci scattered throughout the chromosome. Crucially, the majority of functional effector genes are encoded by nine exchangeable effector loci that lie within lambdoid prophages. Thus, type III secretion in

Two full-genome sequences of porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) are reported. The 
genomes were recovered from pooled serum samples from sows who had just 
delivered litters with variable numbers of stillbirths. The two circular genomes 
(PCV3-BR/RS/6 and PCV3-BR/RS/8) are 2,000 nucleotides long and contain two open 
reading frames (ORFs) oriented in opposite directions that encode the putative 
capsid (Cap) and replicase (Rep) proteins. The intergenic region contains a 
stem-loop motif, as reported for other circoviruses. Rolling circle replication 
motifs and putative helicase domains were identified in the Rep coding region. 
The degree of overall nucleotide similarity between the genomes reported here 
and those available at GenBank was higher than 97%. No PCV3 sequence was 
detected in pooled serum samples from sows which had no stillbirths on the same 
farms. However, further studies are necessary to confirm the association between 
PCV3 and the occurrence of stillbirths.

BACKGROUND: The analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 
varicella-zoster virus (VZV) has enabled differentiation between wild-type 
genotypes from the Oka vaccine strain (V-Oka).
OBJECTIVES: To genotype VZV strains in Australia using high-resolution melt 
(HRM) analysis of SNPs in five gene targets.
STUDY DESIGN: Extracted DNA from 78 samples obtained from patients with 
chickenpox and zoster were genotyped by HRM analysis of SNPs in five open 
reading frames (ORFs): 1 (685 G>A), 21 (33725 C>T), 37 (66288 G>A), 60 (101464 
C>A) and 62 (106262 T>C) using a double-stranded (ds) DNA saturating dye, LC 
Green Plus.
RESULTS: For each genotype, melt curve temperature (Tm) shifts differentiated 
the nucleotide present at that locus (P<0.0001) with melting curve shifts 
between alleles ranging from 0.56 degrees C (ORF 37) to 3.34 degrees C (ORF 62). 
The most common genotypes detected were the European Type C (59%) and B (18%) 
strains. This was followed by the African/Asian Type A (14%) and Japanese J1 
(9%), strains, both prevalent in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.
CONCLUSIONS: HRM analysis of SNPs showed that the European B and C genotypes 
were most prevalent in Australia, with genotypes A and J strains also present. 
HRM analysis using a dsDNA dye provides a useful tool in classifying 
varicella-zoster viruses.

The family Coronaviridae represents a diverse group of vertebrate RNA viruses, 
all with genomes greater than 26,000 nt. Here, we report the discovery and 
genetic characterization of a novel virus present in cattle with respiratory 
disease. Phylogenetic characterization of this virus revealed that it clusters 
within the subfamily Torovirinae, in the family Coronaviridae. The complete 
genome consists of only 20,261 nt and represents the smallest reported 
coronavirus genome. We identified seven ORFs, including the canonical nidovirus 
ORF1a and ORF1b. Analysis of polyprotein 1ab revealed that this virus, 
tentatively named bovine nidovirus (BoNV), shares the highest homology with the 
recently described python-borne nidoviruses and contains several conserved 
nidovirus motifs, but does not encode the NendoU or O-MT domains that are 
present in other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. In concert with its 
reduced genome, the atypical domain architecture indicates that this virus 
represents a unique lineage within the order Nidovirales.

            are among the principal tick species associated with pathogen transmission. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the viromes of these tick species and identified the presence of Powassan virus and eight novel viruses. These included the most divergent nairovirus described to date, two new clades of tick-borne phleboviruses, a mononegavirus, and viruses with similarity to plant and insect viruses. Our analysis revealed that ticks are reservoirs for a wide range of viruses and suggests that discovery and characterization of tick-borne viruses will have implications for viral taxonomy and may provide insight into tick-transmitted diseases.

            Ticks are implicated as vectors of a wide array of human and animal pathogens. To better understand the extent of tick-borne diseases, it is crucial to uncover the full range of microbial agents associated with ticks. Our current knowledge of the diversity of tick-associated viruses is limited, in part due to the lack of investigation of tick viromes. In this study, we examined the viromes of three tick species from the United States. We found that ticks are hosts to highly divergent viruses across several taxa, including ones previously associated with human disease. Our data underscore the diversity of tick-associated viruses and provide the foundation for further studies into viral etiology of tick-borne diseases.

influenza A virus (IAV) in wild birds in northern Europe, while information from 
southern Europe is more limited. Here, we present an IAV surveillance study 
conducted in western Portugal 2008-2009, analyzing 1653 samples from six 
different species of waterfowl, with the majority of samples taken from Mallards 
(Anas platyrhynchos). Overall 4.4% of sampled birds were infected. The sampling 
results revealed a significant temporal variation in the IAV prevalence, 
including a pronounced peak among predominantly young birds in June, indicating 
that IAV circulate within breeding populations in the wetlands of western 
Portugal. The H10N7 and H9N2 subtypes were predominant among isolated viruses. 
Phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences of H10N7, 
H9N2 and H11N3 virus showed that sequences from Portugal were closely related to 
viral sequences from Central Europe as well as to IAVs isolated in the southern 
parts of Africa, reflecting Portugal's position on the European-African bird 
migratory flyway. This study highlights the importance of Portugal as a 
migratory crossroad for IAV, connecting breeding stationary waterfowl with birds 
migrating between continents which enable transmission and spread of IAV.

The infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a major health threat to the 
world's poultry industry despite intensive controls including proper biosafety 
practices and vaccination. IBDV (Avibirnavirus, Birnaviridae) is a non-enveloped 
virus with a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome. The virus is traditionally 
classified into classic, variant and very virulent strains, each with different 
epidemiological relevance and clinical implications. Recently, a novel worldwide 
spread genetic lineage was described and denoted as distinct (d) IBDV. Here, we 
report the development and validation of a reverse transcription-quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay for the specific detection of dIBDVs 
in the global poultry industry. The assay employs a TaqMan-MGB probe that 
hybridizes with a unique molecular signature of dIBDV. The assay successfully 
detected all the assessed strains belonging to the dIBDV genetic lineage, 
showing high specificity and absence of cross-reactivity with non-dIBDVs, 
IBDV-negative samples and other common avian viruses. Using serial dilutions of 
in vitro-transcribed RNA we obtained acceptable PCR efficiencies and 
determination coefficients, and relatively small intra- and inter-assay 
variability. The assay demonstrated a wide dynamic range between 103 and 108 RNA 
copies/reaction. This rapid, specific and quantitative assay is expected to 
improve IBDV surveillance and control worldwide and to increase our 
understanding of the molecular epidemiology of this economically detrimental 
poultry pathogen.

An adult male muskox ( Ovibos moschatus ), harvested on 26 August 2014 on 
Victoria Island, Nunavut, in the Canadian Arctic, had proliferative dermatitis 
on the muzzle and fetlocks suggestive of contagious ecthyma or orf 
(Parapoxvirus). Histopathologic features of the lesions were consistent with 
this diagnosis. Orf virus DNA, phylogenetically similar to an isolate from a 
captive muskox of the Minnesota Zoo, US, was detected in the lesions by PCR 
using Parapoxvirus primers. Additionally, there was a metaphyseal abscess with a 
cortical fistula in the right metacarpus from which Brucella suis biovar 4 was 
isolated and identification supported by PCR. Brucella spp. antibodies were 
detected in serum. Finally, 212 nodules were dissected from the lungs. Fecal 
analysis and lung examination demonstrated co-infection with the lungworms 
Umingmakstrongylus pallikuukensis and Varestrongylus eleguneniensis. The 
zoonotic potential of orf and rangiferine brucellosis adds an important public 
health dimension to this case, particularly given that muskoxen are a valuable 
source of food for Arctic residents. Careful examination of these pathogens at a 
population level is needed as they may contribute to muskox population decline 
and potentially constitute a driver of food insecurity for local communities. 
This case underscores the importance of wildlife health surveillance as a 
management tool to conserve wildlife populations and maintain food security in 
subsistence-oriented communities.

Detection and Heterogeneity of Herpesviruses Causing Pacheco's Disease in Parrots,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Pacheco's disease (PD) is a common, often fatal, disease of parrots. We cloned a virus isolate from a parrot that had characteristic lesions of PD. Three viral clones were partially sequenced, demonstrating that this virus was an alphaherpesvirus most closely related to the gallid herpesvirus 1. Five primer sets were developed from these sequences. The primer sets were used with PCR to screen tissues or tissue culture media suspected to contain viruses from 54 outbreaks of PD. The primer sets amplified DNA from all but one sample. Ten amplification patterns were detected, indicating that PD is caused by a genetically heterogeneous population of viruses. A single genetic variant (psittacid herpesvirus variant 1) amplified with all primer sets and was the most common virus variant (62.7%). A single primer set (23F) amplified DNA from all of the positive samples, suggesting that PCR could be used as a rapid postmortem assay for these viruses. PCR was found to be significantly more sensitive than tissue culture for the detection of psittacid herpesviruses.</jats:p>",0
Molecular Phylogeny of the Psittacid Herpesviruses Causing Pacheco's Disease: Correlation of Genotype with Phenotypic Expression,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Fragments of 419 bp of the UL16 open reading frame from 73 psittacid herpesviruses (PsHVs) from the United States and Europe were sequenced. All viruses caused Pacheco's disease, and serotypes of the European isolates were known. A phylogenetic tree derived from these sequences demonstrated that the PsHVs that cause Pacheco's disease comprised four major genotypes, with each genotype including between two and four variants. With the exception of two viruses, the serotypes of the virus isolates could be predicted by the genotypes. Genotypes 1 and 4 corresponded to serotype 1 isolates, genotype 2 corresponded to serotype 2 isolates, and genotype 3 corresponded to serotype 3 isolates. The single serotype 4 virus mapped to genotype 4. DNA from a virus with a unique serotype could not be amplified with primers that amplified DNA from all other PsHVs, and its classification remains unknown. Viruses representing all four genotypes were found in both the United States and Europe, and it was therefore predicted that serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were present in the United States. Serotype 4 was represented by a single European isolate that could not be genetically distinguished from serotype 1 viruses; therefore, the presence of serotype 4 in the United States could not be predicted. Viruses of genotype 4 were found to be the most commonly associated with Pacheco's disease in macaws and conures and were least likely to be isolated in chicken embryo fibroblasts in the United States. All four genotypes caused deaths in Amazon parrots, but genotype 4 was associated with Pacheco's disease only in Amazons in Europe. Genotypes 2, 3, and 4, but not 1, were found in African grey parrots. Although parrots from the Pacific distribution represent a relatively small percentage of the total number of birds with Pacheco's disease, all four genotypes were found to cause disease in these species.</jats:p>",0
Characterization of the Dynamic Transcriptome of a Herpesvirus with Long-read Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Herpesvirus gene expression is co-ordinately regulated and sequentially ordered during productive infection. The viral genes can be classified into three distinct kinetic groups: immediate-early, early, and late classes. In this study, a massively parallel sequencing technique that is based on PacBio Single Molecule Real-time sequencing platform, was used for quantifying the poly(A) fraction of the lytic transcriptome of pseudorabies virus (PRV) throughout a 12-hour interval of productive infection on PK-15 cells. Other approaches, including microarray, real-time RT-PCR and Illumina sequencing are capable of detecting only the aggregate transcriptional activity of particular genomic regions, but not individual herpesvirus transcripts. However, SMRT sequencing allows for a distinction between transcript isoforms, including length- and splice variants, as well as between overlapping polycistronic RNA molecules. The non-amplified Isoform Sequencing (Iso-Seq) method was used to analyse the kinetic properties of the lytic PRV transcripts and to then classify them accordingly. Additionally, the present study demonstrates the general utility of long-read sequencing for the time-course analysis of global gene expression in practically any organism.</jats:p>",0

Animal serum is an essential supplement for cell culture media. Contamination of 
animal serum with adventitious viruses has led to major regulatory action and 
product recalls. We used metagenomic methods to detect and characterize viral 
contaminants in 26 bovine serum samples from 12 manufacturers. Across samples, 
we detected sequences with homology to 20 viruses at depths of up to 50,000 
viral reads per million. The viruses detected represented nine viral families 
plus four taxonomically unassigned viruses and had both RNA genomes and DNA 
genomes. Sequences ranged from 28% to 96% similar at the amino acid level to 
viruses in the GenBank database. The number of viruses varied from zero to 11 
among samples and from one to 11 among suppliers, with only one product from one 
supplier being entirely ""clean."" For one common adventitious virus, bovine viral 
diarrhea virus (BVDV), abundance estimates calculated from metagenomic data 
(viral reads per million) closely corresponded to Ct values from quantitative 
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtq-PCR), with 
metagenomics being approximately as sensitive as rtq-PCR. Metagenomics is useful 
for detecting taxonomically and genetically diverse adventitious viruses in 
commercial serum products, and it provides sensitive and quantitative 
information.

A selection of 43 bovine viral diarrhoea viruses isolated from mainly 
persistently infected cattle on 23 Slovenian farms between 1997 and 2001 were 
characterised genetically. Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures, 
reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR with primers targeting the 5'-UTR and 
the N(pro) gene, followed by direct sequencing of purified PCR products obtained 
for both genomic regions. The N(pro) sequences provided the best genetic 
resolution, and gave also higher statistical support for phylogenetic 
classification of the viruses. Thirty-eight of the Slovenian isolates were of 
genetic subtypes 1d and 1f, four were 1b, and one subtype 1g. No BVDV type 2 
viruses were found. This genetic prevalence matched those previously reported 
for neighbouring countries, as opposed to findings reported for more distant 
European countries, e.g. France, Spain and the UK. From eight cattle herds 
several virus isolates were analysed; with one exception all isolates from each 
herd were of the same genetic group. Extended sequencing of the N(pro) and part 
of the C gene of virus isolates with identical 5'-UTR sequences allowed 
differentiation between isolates obtained at different times from one herd.

This study reports the genetic characterization of highly pathogenic avian 
influenza (HPAI) virus (subtype H5N1) isolated from poultry in West Bengal, 
India. We analyzed all the eight genome segments of two viruses isolated from 
chickens in January 2010 to understand their genetic relationship with other 
Indian H5N1 isolates and possible connection between different outbreaks. The 
hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the viruses showed multiple basic amino acids at the 
cleavage site, a marker for high virulence in chickens. Of greatest concern was 
that the viruses displayed amino acid substitution from serine-to-asparagine at 
position 31 of M2 ion channel protein suggesting emergence of 
amantadine-resistant mutants not previously reported in HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in 
India. Amino acid lysine at position 627 of the PB2 protein highlights the risk 
the viruses possess to mammals. In the phylogenetic trees, the viruses clustered 
within the lineage of avian isolates from India (2008-2009) and avian and human 
isolates from Bangladesh (2007-2009) in all the genes. Both these viruses were 
most closely related to the viruses from 2008 in West Bengal within the subclade 
2.2.3 of H5N1 viruses.

Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a serious transboundary infectious disease 
of small ruminants. The causal agent, PPR virus (PPRV), can be separated into 
four genetically distinct lineages using phylogenetic analysis. In recent 
decades, lineage IV of PPRV has dramatically extended its geographic 
distribution from Asia to the Middle East and to Africa, where it has 
progressively replaced other PPRV lineages. Lineages I and II are historically 
distributed in West Africa. Currently, lineage II appears to dominate the 
region, whereas the last recorded occurrence of lineage I dates back to 1994. 
Recent studies reported the presence of lineage IV in Nigeria, suggesting that 
this lineage is expanding in West Africa. In Niger, a close neighbour of 
Nigeria, PPRV has never been genetically characterized, despite reports of PPR 
incidence. In this study, pathological samples collected from sick goats were 
collected in 2013 during a suspected PPR outbreak in southern Niger close to the 
Nigerian border were compared to samples collected in a previous investigation 
in October 2001 in south-western Niger. These strains were characterized by 
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to identify their genetic lineage. Our 
results show that in 2001, lineages I and II were cocirculating in south-western 
Niger, whereas the strain that caused the outbreak in 2013 belonged to lineage 
IV and is closely related to strains identified in Nigeria. These results 
confirm the progression of lineage IV in West Africa. The process of PPRV 
lineage replacement and its implications for the epidemiology and the control of 
the disease in this region are unclear and should be the subject of further 
studies in the field.

Genetic and biological characterisation of an avian-like H1N2 swine influenza virus generated by reassortment of circulating avian-like H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in Denmark,"1. Virol J. 2013 Sep 18;10:290. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-10-290.

Genetic and biological characterisation of an avian-like H1N2 swine influenza 
virus generated by reassortment of circulating avian-like H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes

BACKGROUND: The influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are the most 
prevalent subtypes in swine. In 2003, a reassorted H1N2 swine influenza virus 
(SIV) subtype appeared and became prevalent in Denmark. In the present study, 
the reassortant H1N2 subtype was characterised genetically and the infection 
dynamics compared to an ""avian-like"" H1N1 virus by an experimental infection 
study.
METHODS: Sequence analyses were performed of the H1N2 virus. Two groups of pigs 
were inoculated with the reassortant H1N2 virus and an ""avian-like"" H1N1 virus, 
respectively, followed by inoculation with the opposite subtype four weeks 
later. Measurements of HI antibodies and acute phase proteins were performed. 
Nasal virus excretion and virus load in lungs were determined by real-time 
RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the reassorted H1N2 virus 
contained a European ""avian-like"" H1-gene and a European ""swine-like"" N2-gene, 
thus being genetically distinct from most H1N2 viruses circulating in Europe, 
but similar to viruses reported in 2009/2010 in Sweden and Italy. Sequence 
analyses of the internal genes revealed that the reassortment probably arose 
between circulating Danish ""avian-like"" H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs. Infected pigs 
developed cross-reactive antibodies, and increased levels of acute phase 
proteins after inoculations. Pigs inoculated with H1N2 exhibited nasal virus 
excretion for seven days, peaking day 1 after inoculation two days earlier than 
H1N1 infected pigs and at a six times higher level. The difference, however, was 
not statistically significant. Pigs euthanized on day 4 after inoculation, had a 
high virus load in all lung lobes. After the second inoculation, the nasal virus 
excretion was minimal. There were no clinical sign except elevated body 
temperature under the experimental conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The ""avian-like"" H1N2 subtype, which has been established in the 
Danish pig population at least since 2003, is a reassortant between circulating 
swine ""avian-like"" H1N1 and H3N2. The Danish H1N2 has an ""avian-like"" H1 and 
differs from most other reported H1N2 viruses in Europe and North America/Asia, 
which have H1-genes of human or ""classical-swine"" origin, respectively. The 
variant seems, however, also to be circulating in countries like Sweden and 
Italy. The infection dynamics of the reassorted ""avian-like"" H1N2 is similar to 
the older ""avian-like"" H1N1 subtype.

There is nothing permanent except change. The emergence of new virus diseases.

Maximilians University, Munich, Germany.

The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of 
fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans 
and animals. The emergence of a ""new"" pathogen is not an isolated event, as for 
instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. 
Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible 
population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In 
rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such 
as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or 
most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United 
Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but 
an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in 
host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more 
efficiently, is often unknown. This review tries to summarize the facts that are 
known about a wide variety of ""new"" viruses of mammals, such as the simian, 
human and feline lentiviruses, the feline coronaviruses, the feline 
parvoviruses, the carnivore morbilliviruses, the influenza A viruses, and the 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. A particular emphasis will be put on 
the genetic mechanisms that might have taken place and that might have been 
responsible for their sudden appearance.

Sequence diversity was assessed of the complete VP1 gene directly amplified from 
49 clinical specimens during an explosive foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak 
in Taiwan. Type O Taiwan FMD viruses are genetically highly homogenous, as seen 
by the minute divergence of 0.2-0.9% revealed in 20 variants. The 
O/HCP-0314/TW/97 and O/TCP-022/TW/97 viral variants dominated FMD outbreaks and 
were prevalent in most affected pig-raising areas. Comparison of deduced amino 
acid sequences around the main neutralizable antigenic sites on the VP1 
polypeptide showed no significant antigenic variation. However, the 
O/CHP-158/TW/97 variant had an alternative critical residue at position 43 in 
antigenic site 3, which may be due to selective pressure in the field. Two 
vaccine production strains (O1/Manisa/Turkey/69 and O1/Campos/Brazil/71) 
probably provide partial heterologous protection of swine against O Taiwan 
viruses. The type O Taiwan variants clustered in sublineage A1 of four main 
lineages in the phylogenetic tree. The O/Hong Kong/9/94 and 
O/1685/Moscow/Russia/95 viruses in sublineage A2 are closely related to the O 
Taiwan variants. The causative agent for the 1997 epidemic presumably originated 
from a single common source of type O FMD viruses prevalent in neighboring 
areas.

were diagnosed with rabies. Since then, a variety of wild carnivores and other 
wildlife species have been found dead, neurologically ill, or exhibiting 
aggressive behaviors around the island. To determine the affected animal 
species, geographic areas, and environments, animal bodies were examined for 
rabies by direct fluorescent antibody test (FAT). The viral genomes from the 
brains of selected rabid animals were sequenced for the phylogeny of rabies 
viruses (RABV). Out of a total of 1016 wild carnivores, 276/831 (33.2%) Formosan 
FBs were FAT positive, with occasional biting incidents in 1 dog and suspected 
spillover in 1 house shrew. All other animals tested, including dogs, cats, 
bats, mice, house shrews, and squirrels, were rabies-negative. The rabies was 
badger-associated and confined to nine counties/cities in sylvatic environments. 
Phylogeny of nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes from 59 Formosan FB-associated 
RABV revealed them to be clustered in two distinct groups, TWI and TWII, 
consistent with the geographic segregation into western and eastern Taiwan 
provided by the Central Mountain Range and into northern rabies-free and 
central-southern rabies-affected regions by a river bisecting western Taiwan. 
The unique features of geographic and genetic segregation, sylvatic enzooticity, 
and FB-association of RABV suggest a logical strategy for the control of rabies 
in this nation.

An Evolutionarily Young Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus) Endogenous Retrovirus Identified from Next Generation Sequence Data,"<jats:p>Transcriptome analysis of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) tissues identified sequences with similarity to Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV). Based on these sequences, four proviral copies and 15 solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) of a newly described endogenous retrovirus were characterized from the polar bear draft genome sequence. Closely related sequences were identified by PCR analysis of brown bear (Ursus arctos) and black bear (Ursus americanus) but were absent in non-Ursinae bear species. The virus was therefore designated UrsusERV. Two distinct groups of LTRs were observed including a recombinant ERV that contained one LTR belonging to each group indicating that genomic invasions by at least two UrsusERV variants have recently occurred. Age estimates based on proviral LTR divergence and conservation of integration sites among ursids suggest the viral group is only a few million years old. The youngest provirus was polar bear specific, had intact open reading frames (ORFs) and could potentially encode functional proteins. Phylogenetic analyses of UrsusERV consensus protein sequences suggest that it is part of a pig, gibbon and koala retrovirus clade. The young age estimates and lineage specificity of the virus suggests UrsusERV is a recent cross species transmission from an unknown reservoir and places the viral group among the youngest of ERVs identified in mammals.</jats:p>",0

The discovery of novel viruses in animals expands our knowledge of viral 
diversity and potentially emerging zoonoses. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) 
technology gives millions or even billions of sequence reads per run, allowing a 
comprehensive survey of the genetic content within a sample without prior 
nucleic acid amplification. In this study, we screened 156 rectal swab samples 
from apparently healthy bats (n = 96), pigs (n = 9), cattles (n = 9), stray dogs 
(n = 11), stray cats (n = 11) and monkeys (n = 20) using a HTS metagenomics 
approach. The complete genome of a novel papillomavirus (PV), Miniopterus 
schreibersii papillomavirus type 1 (MscPV1), with L1 of 60% nucleotide identity 
to Canine papillomavirus (CPV6), was identified in a specimen from a Common 
Bent-wing Bat (M. schreibersii). It is about 7.5kb in length, with a G+C content 
of 45.8% and a genomic organization similar to that of other PVs. Despite the 
higher nucleotide identity between the genomes of MscPV1 and CPV6, 
maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene sequence showed that 
MscPV1 and Erethizon dorsatum papillomavirus (EdPV1) are most closely related. 
Estimated divergence time of MscPV1 from the EdPV1/MscPV1 common ancestor was 
approximately 60.2-91.9 millions of years ago, inferred under strict clocks 
using the L1 and E1 genes. The estimates were limited by the lack of reliable 
calibration points from co-divergence because of possible host shifts. As the 
nucleotide sequence of this virus only showed limited similarity with that of 
related animal PVs, the conventional approach of PCR using consensus primers 
would be unlikely to have detected the novel virus in the sample. Unlike the 
first bat papillomavirus RaPV1, MscPV1 was found in an asymptomatic bat with no 
apparent mucosal or skin lesions whereas RaPV1 was detected in the basosquamous 
carcinoma of a fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus. We propose MscPV1 as the first 
member of the novel Dyolambda-papillomavirus genus.

Partetravirus is a recently described group of animal parvoviruses which include 
the human partetravirus, bovine partetravirus and porcine partetravirus 
(previously known as human parvovirus 4, bovine hokovirus and porcine hokovirus 
respectively). In this report, we describe the discovery and genomic 
characterization of partetraviruses in bovine and ovine samples from China. 
These partetraviruses were detected by PCR in 1.8% of bovine liver samples, 
66.7% of ovine liver samples and 71.4% of ovine spleen samples. One of the 
bovine partetraviruses detected in the present samples is phylogenetically 
distinct from previously reported bovine partetraviruses and likely represents a 
novel genotype. The ovine partetravirus is a novel partetravirus and 
phylogenetically most related to the bovine partetraviruses. The genome 
organization is conserved amongst these viruses, including the presence of a 
putative transmembrane protein encoded by an overlapping reading frame in ORF2. 
Results from the present study provide further support to the classification of 
partetraviruses as a separate genus in Parvovirinae.

A Novel Activation Mechanism of Avian Influenza Virus H9N2 by Furin,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Avian influenza virus H9N2 is prevalent in waterfowl and has become endemic in poultry in Asia and the Middle East. H9N2 influenza viruses have served as a reservoir of internal genes for other avian influenza viruses that infect humans, and several cases of human infection by H9N2 influenza viruses have indicated its pandemic potential. Fortunately, an extensive surveillance program enables close monitoring of H9N2 influenza viruses worldwide and has generated a large repository of virus sequences and phylogenetic information. Despite the large quantity of sequences in different databases, very little is known about specific virus isolates and their pathogenesis. Here, we characterize a low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus, A/chicken/Israel/810/2001 (H9N2) (Israel810), which is representative of influenza virus strains that have caused severe morbidity and mortality in poultry farms. We show that under certain circumstances the Israel810 hemagglutinin (HA) can be activated by furin, a hallmark of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. We demonstrate that Israel810 HA can be cleaved in cells with high levels of furin expression and that a mutation that eliminates a glycosylation site in HA
            <jats:sub>1</jats:sub>
            allows the Israel810 HA to gain universal cleavage in cell culture. Pseudoparticles generated from Israel810 HA, or the glycosylation mutant, transduce cells efficiently. In contrast, introduction of a polybasic cleavage site into Israel810 HA leads to pseudoviruses that are compromised for transduction. Our data indicate a mechanism for an H9N2 evolutionary pathway that may allow it to gain virulence in a distinct manner from H5 and H7 influenza viruses.

Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are oncogenic viruses. In cattle, BPV-1/2 is 
associated with urinary bladder cancer and BPV-4 with upper GI tract cancer. BPV 
E5 is a small hydrophobic protein localised in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
and Golgi apparatus (GA). E5 is the major transforming protein of BPVs, capable 
of inducing cell transformation in cultured mouse fibroblasts and, in 
cooperation with E7, in primary bovine cells. E5-induced cell transformation is 
accompanied by activation of several cellular protein kinases, including growth 
factor receptors, and alkalinisation of endosomes and GA. We have reported that 
BPV E5 causes swelling and fragmentation of the GA and extensive vacuolisation 
of the cytoplasm. We now show that E5 from both BPV-1 and BPV-4 disturbs the 
actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions in transformed bovine cells, where these 
morphological and behavioural characteristics are accompanied by 
hyperphosphorylation of the cellular phosphotyrosine kinase c-src. Both BPV-1 
and BPV-4 E5 increase the motility of transformed mouse cells, but only BPV-1 E5 
causes transformed mouse cells to penetrate a matrigel matrix. BPV-1 transformed 
mouse cells, but not BPV-4 transformed mouse cells, have hyperhpsphorylated 
c-src.

To study the genetic diversity of enterovirus G (EV-G) among Japanese pigs, 
metagenomics sequencing was performed on fecal samples from pigs with or without 
diarrhea, collected between 2014 and 2016. Fifty-nine EV-G sequences, which were 
>5,000 nucleotides long, were obtained. By complete VP1 sequence analysis, 
Japanese EV-G isolates were classified into G1 (17 strains), G2 (four strains), 
G3 (22 strains), G4 (two strains), G6 (two strains), G9 (six strains), G10 (five 
strains), and a new genotype (one strain). Remarkably, 16 G1 and one G2 strain 
identified in diarrheic (23.5%; four strains) or normal (76.5%; 13 strains) 
fecal samples possessed a papain-like cysteine protease (PL-CP) sequence, which 
was recently found in the USA and Belgium in the EV-G genome, at the 2C-3A 
junction site. This paper presents the first report of the high prevalence of 
viruses carrying PL-CP in the EV-G population. Furthermore, possible inter- and 
intragenotype recombination events were found among EV-G strains, including 
G1-PL-CP strains. Our findings may advance the understanding of the molecular 
epidemiology and genetic evolution of EV-Gs.

BACKGROUND: Bovine enterovirus (BEV) belongs to the species Enterovirus E or F, 
genus Enterovirus and family Picornaviridae. Although numerous studies have 
identified BEVs in the feces of cattle with diarrhea, the pathogenicity of BEVs 
remains unclear. Previously, we reported the detection of novel kobu-like virus 
in calf feces, by metagenomics analysis. In the present study, we identified a 
novel BEV in diarrheal feces collected for that survey. Complete genome 
sequences were determined by deep sequencing in feces. Secondary RNA structure 
analysis of the 5' untranslated region (UTR), phylogenetic tree construction and 
pairwise identity analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: The complete genome sequences of BEV were genetically distant from 
other EVs and the VP1 coding region contained novel and unique amino acid 
sequences. We named this strain as BEV AN12/Bos taurus/JPN/2014 (referred to as 
BEV-AN12). According to genome analysis, the genome length of this virus is 7414 
nucleotides excluding the poly (A) tail and its genome consists of a 5'UTR, open 
reading frame encoding a single polyprotein, and 3'UTR. The results of secondary 
RNA structure analysis showed that in the 5'UTR, BEV-AN12 had an additional 
clover leaf structure and small stem loop structure, similarly to other BEVs. In 
pairwise identity analysis, BEV-AN12 showed high amino acid (aa) identities to 
Enterovirus F in the polyprotein, P2 and P3 regions (aa identity ≥82.4%). 
Therefore, BEV-AN12 is closely related to Enterovirus F. However, aa sequences 
in the capsid protein regions, particularly the VP1 encoding region, showed 
significantly low aa identity to other viruses in genus Enterovirus (VP1 aa 
identity ≤58.6%). In addition, BEV-AN12 branched separately from Enterovirus E 
and F in phylogenetic trees based on the aa sequences of P1 and VP1, although it 
clustered with Enterovirus F in trees based on sequences in the P2 and P3 genome 
region.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel BEV possessing highly divergent aa sequences in 
the VP1 coding region in Japan. According to species definition, we proposed 
naming this strain as ""Enterovirus K"", which is a novel species within genus 
Enterovirus. Further genomic studies are needed to understand the pathogenicity 
of BEVs.

Evidence of serologic diversity within group C rotaviruses,"<jats:p>The Cowden strain of porcine group C rotavirus and the Shintoku strain of bovine group C rotavirus were classified as different serotypes by two-way cross-neutralization tests. Two neutralization patterns against the Cowden and Shintoku strains were observed when hyperimmune or convalescent-phase antisera to three noncultivatable porcine group C rotaviruses and a human group C rotavirus were used in one-way cross-neutralization tests. Antisera to two porcine group C rotaviruses and the human group C rotavirus neutralized the Cowden strain at high titers but did not neutralize the Shintoku strain, suggesting that these three strains are serotypically related to the Cowden strain. The remaining antisera to a porcine group C rotavirus (HF strain) reacted with the Cowden and Shintoku group C rotaviruses in cell culture immunofluorescence tests but did not neutralize either virus in one-way cross-neutralization, suggesting that the HF strain belongs to a third serotype. However, confirmation of these findings requires additional analysis by two-way cross-neutralization. Our findings support the existence of at least two distinct serotypes of group C rotaviruses, and possibly a third, among animals and humans. The serotypic similarity observed between the Cowden strain and a human group C rotavirus suggests that the cultivatable Cowden strain and antiserum to this virus may provide important reagents for the diagnosis of group C rotaviruses in humans.</jats:p>",0

Three samples tested positive for all three viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene showed that the most frequent RVC genotype was G1, which grouped with the prototypic RVC Cowden strain. While G6 and G9 were also common, G3 was relatively rare. Analysis of the VP4 gene revealed that the most common P type was P[5], followed by P[4], P[7], and P[1].

Bivens Arm virus (BAV) is a newly discovered rhabdovirus infecting cattle and 
water buffalo in Florida. The virus is classified as a member of the Tibrogargan 
group, members of which have hitherto been found only in Australasia. They are 
considered to be transmitted by Culicoides species. Bivens Arm virus was first 
isolated from Culicoides insignis which suggests that BAV is also transmitted by 
this genus. A serological survey of two small groups of cattle raised in St. 
Croix and Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean, established that antibody to BAV, or a 
closely related virus, exists on both island. A retrospective analysis of 
seroconversions to BAV in sentinel calves in Florida, relative to populations of 
potential Culicoides vectors, failed to demonstrate any statistically 
significant correlation.

The feline gastrointestinal microbiota have direct influence on feline health 
and also human health as a reservoir for potential zoonotic pathogens and 
antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. In order to describe the feline 
gastrointestinal microbial diversity, fecal samples from cats have been 
characterized using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. 
However, data correlating total microbial composition and their functions are 
lacking. Present descriptive study evaluated both phylogenetic and metabolic 
diversity of the feline intestinal microbiota using GS Junior titanium shotgun 
pyrosequencing. A total of 152,494 pyrosequencing reads (5405 assembled contigs) 
were generated and classified into both phylogenetic and metabolic profiles of 
the feline intestinal microbiota. The Bacteroides/Chlorobi group was the most 
predominant bacterial phylum comprising ~68% of total classified diversity, 
followed by Firmicutes (~13%) and Proteobacteria (~6%) respectively. Archaea, 
fungi and viruses made up the minor communities in the overall microbial 
diversity. Interestingly, this study also identified a range of potential 
enteric zoonotic pathogens (0.02-1.25%) and genes involved in antimicrobial 
resistance (0.02-0.7%) in feline fecal materials. Based on clustering among nine 
gastrointestinal metagenomes from five different monogastric hosts (dog, human, 
mice, cat and chicken), the cat metagenome clustered closely together with 
chicken in both phylogenetic and metabolic level (>80%). Future studies are 
required to provide deeper understandings on both intrinsic and extrinsic 
effects such as impact of age, genetics and dietary interventions on the 
composition of the feline gastrointestinal microbiome.

A more exhaustive analysis of JEV evolution using 107 envelope sequences available for isolates from different geographic locations worldwide revealed five distinct genotypes of JEV, displaying a minimum nucleotide divergence of 7% with high bootstrap support values. The tree also revealed overall clustering of strains based on geographic location, as well as multiple introductions of JEV into the Indian subcontinent. Nonsynonymous nucleotide divergence rates of the envelope gene estimated that the ancestor common to all JEV genotypes arose within the last three hundred years.</jats:p>",0

This paper describes the complete genome sequence of IT-227/82, a strain of 
avian paramyxovirus type-1 of pigeon (PPMV-1). IT-227/82 is an antigenic variant 
of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) of chickens. The genome is 15,192 nucleotides 
(nt) long, similarly to the previously published NDV strain ZJ1. It is, however, 
six nt longer than the genomes of NDV strains LaSota/46 and Beaudette C. The 
six-nt insertion was located in the 5' non-coding region of the nucleoprotein 
(NP) gene. The presence of this six-nt insertion showed no correlation with the 
virulence or the reservoir of the NDV strains sequenced so far. The genome 
length of 15,186 or 15,192 nt can be connected however, to ""old"" (I, II, III and 
IV) and ""new"" (V, VI, VII and VIII) NDV genotypes, respectively. Comparison of 
open reading frames indicated that the PPMV-1 strain IT-227/82 encodes the 
longest W protein, (227 amino acids). The length of the W protein showed 
remarkable differences even within genotypes and cannot be regarded, therefore, 
as a phylogenetic feature. The haemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of strain 
IT-227/82 consists of 571 amino acids, similarly to genotypes IV, V and VII NDV 
strains, while genotype I and II strains have longer HN proteins, 616 and 577 
amino acids, respectively. The length of the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase 
protein possesses phylogenetic importance.

A host variant of Newcastle disease virus (NDV, genus Avulavirus, family 
Paramyxoviridae) is responsible for an autonomous disease in pigeons. It emerged 
in the late 1970s in the Mediterranean region. Despite great genetic diversity 
the vast majority of strains belong to a monophyletic group (sublineage VIb) 
within genotype VI of NDV strains that were indigenous in the region at that 
time. To date only a monoclonal antibody assay is available for the specific 
identification of pigeon type strains. A specific genetic assay is described 
suitable for the identification of pigeon isolates. Cleavage site analysis of a 
1349 bp amplicon of the fusion protein gene was carried out using restriction 
enzymes (RE) HinfI, BstOI and RsaI. RE analysis of over 100 strains isolated 
between 1978 and 2002 deriving from 16 countries has revealed nine RE-patterns, 
which were progressive site variants of the parental (group VI) genotype. In 
spite of substantial site variation, extant pigeon viruses lacked a BstOI 
cleavage site at nucleotide 1601 shared by other NDV strains of chicken origin. 
RE analysis is a simple and reliable method both for the identification and 
subgrouping of pigeon type viruses.

Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) has emerged as one of the economically 
important pathogens in cattle populations, with a worldwide distribution and 
causing a complex of disease syndromes. Two genotypes, BVDV 1 and 2, exist and 
are discriminated on the basis of the sequence of the 5' non-coding region (5' 
NCR) using real-time PCR. Real-time PCR is more sensitive, specific, and less 
time-consuming than conventional PCR, and it has less risk of 
cross-contamination of samples. Limited information exists on BVDV genetic 
subtypes in South Africa. The aim of this study was to determine the genotypes 
of BVDV currently circulating in South African feedlots. A total of 279 
specimens (219 tissue samples, 59 trans-tracheal aspirates and 1 blood sample) 
were collected from dead and living cattle with lesions or clinical signs 
compatible with BVDV infection. Pooled homogenates from the same animals were 
prepared, and total RNA was extracted. A screening test was performed on the 
pooled samples, and positive pools were investigated individually. A Cador BVDV 
Type 1/2 RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used for the real-time PCR 
assay on a LightCycler(®) V2.0 real-time PCR machine (Roche Diagnostics, 
Mannheim, Germany). The results were read at 530 and 640 nm for BVDV 1 and 2, 
respectively. Bovine viral diarrhoea virus was detected in a total of 103 
samples that included 91 tissue samples, 1 blood sample and 11 trans-tracheal 
aspirates. Eighty-five (82.5 %) of the strains were genotype 1 and 18 (17.5 %) 
were genotype 2. Comparing the sequencing data, genotypes 1 and 2 from the field 
strains did not cluster with vaccine strains currently used in feedlots in South 
Africa. The present study revealed the presence of BVDV genotype 2 in cattle in 
South Africa based on the high sequence similarity between genotype 2 field 
strains and strain 890 from North America. The presence of genotype 2 viruses 
that phylogenetically belong to different clusters and coexist in feedlots is 
consistent with the possibility of multiple virus introductions. These results 
represent the first documented evidence for the presence of BVDV genotype 2 in 
African cattle.

The complete genome sequences of three strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) 
isolated from vaccinated commercial layer flocks in Japan in the span of three 
decades were characterized. All strains had genome lengths of 15,192 nucleotides 
consisting of six genes in the order of 3'-NP-P/V/W-M-F-HN-L-5'. The general 
genomic characteristics of the Japanese field strains were consistent with 
previously characterized class II NDV, except for those belonging to early 
genotypes (genotype I-IV), which lack the six nucleotide insertion at nucleotide 
positions 1,648-1,653 of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene. Phylogenetic analysis 
showed that the Japanese strains could be classified into genotypes VIc and VIIe 
using the complete genome sequence and the complete coding sequence of the 
fusion (F) gene according to the unified NDV classification system. 
Characterization of functional domains and neutralizing epitopes of the F and 
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins of Japanese field strains revealed a 
total of 31 amino acid substitutions, as compared to vaccine strains Ishii and 
B1, which were widely used in Japan. Although virus neutralization (VN) test 
showed that poor flock immunity due to vaccination failure or partial and 
non-uniform immunization maybe the major factors involved in the mechanism of 
breakthrough infection of the Japanese field strains, approximately two to 
threefold decrease in the VN titers of the field NDV strains possessing a point 
mutation (E347K or E347G) at the linear epitope of the HN protein was observed, 
as compared to vaccine strain B1 and field strain 2440/69, which lack the point 
mutation. This study may be a useful reference in characterizing future ND 
outbreaks in vaccinated chickens and as a genetic map for future investigations 
regarding vaccine designs, reverse genetics systems, and development of 
molecular diagnostic tools to prevent future ND outbreaks in vaccinated poultry 
flocks.

Molecular epidemiology of Newcastle disease virus isolates from vaccinated commercial poultry farms in non-epidemic areas of Japan,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Newcastle Disease (ND) is a highly contagious and economically devastating disease of poultry. At present, limited molecular epidemiological data are available regarding the causes of ND outbreaks in vaccinated commercial poultry farms. Knowing the genomic characteristics of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infecting commercial poultry operations in spite of vaccination might give important insights on the infection dynamics of these viruses. In addition, molecular analyses at the subgenotype level and studies on the relationship of Japanese NDVs with other isolates from around the world are lacking. Therefore, in the present study, a molecular epidemiological investigation was conducted to characterize nine NDVs isolated from vaccinated commercial poultry flocks in five different Prefectures in non-epidemic areas of Japan between 1969 and 2002.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic studies were performed to characterize the complete fusion (F)-protein gene, 3-prime end of the nucleoprotein (NP)-gene and 5-prime end of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L)-gene. Sequence data were compared with 180 NDV strains from GenBank representing different NDV genotypes and subgenotypes from different regions of the world at different time periods. Deduced amino acids were analyzed for homologies, recombination and mutation. Recombination events were estimated using Recombination Detection Program (RDP) version 3.44. Phylogenetic trees were constructed to determine evolutionary relationships among strains.</jats:p>

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Mean death time (MDT: 48-56 hr), Intracerebral Pathogenicity Index (ICPI: 1.7-1.9) and deduced amino acid sequences of the F0 proteolytic cleavage site (<jats:sup>112</jats:sup>RRQKR<jats:sup>116</jats:sup>) revealed that all nine field isolates were velogenic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates could be classified into two genetic lineages and three sublineages namely genotypes VIa (lineage 4a), VId (lineage 4d) and VIId (lineage 5d). No recombination events were observed but a point mutation in one of the neutralizing epitope of the F-protein was identified in the field isolates from Japan.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>All field isolates from vaccinated commercial poultry in non-epidemic areas of Japan were part of much bigger outbreaks in provinces and regions and, in some cases, continents. In general, four ND panzootics occurred in Japan and that these outbreaks were mostly characterized by co-circulation of genetically distinct virus lineages due to involvements of infected wild birds. The point mutation identified in the field isolates from Japan may be due to escape from vaccine pressure. The identification of such mutation may be useful for future site-directed mutagenesis to understand the dynamics of NDV infection in vaccinated chickens.</jats:p>

Monitoring viral infections of cell cultures is largely neglected although the 
viruses may have an impact on the physiology of cells and may constitute a 
biohazard regarding laboratory safety and safety of bioactive agents produced by 
cell cultures. PCR, immunological assays, and enzyme activity tests represent 
common methods to detect virus infections. We have screened more than 300 Cancer 
Cell Line Encyclopedia RNA sequencing and 60 whole exome sequencing human cell 
lines data sets for specific viral sequences and general viral nucleotide and 
protein sequence assessment applying the Taxonomer bioinformatics tool developed 
by IDbyDNA. The results were compared with our previous findings from virus 
specific PCR analyses. Both, the results obtained from the direct alignment 
method and the Taxonomer alignment method revealed a complete concordance with 
the PCR results: twenty cell lines were found to be infected with five virus 
species. Taxonomer further uncovered a bovine polyomavirus infection in the 
breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 most likely introduced by contaminated fetal 
bovine serum. RNA-Seq data sets were more sensitive for virus detection although 
a significant proportion of cell lines revealed low numbers of virus specific 
alignments attributable to low level nucleotide contamination during RNA 
preparation or sequencing procedure. Low quality reads leading to Taxonomer 
false positive results can be eliminated by trimming the sequence data before 
analysis. One further important result is that no viruses were detected that had 
never been shown to occur in cell cultures. The results prove that the currently 
applied testing of cell cultures is adequate for the detection of contamination 
and for the risk assessment of cell cultures. The results emphasize that next 
generation sequencing is an efficient tool to determine the viral infection 
status of human cells.

The present study was undertaken with an aim of characterization of rabies virus 
(genus Lyssavirus of the family Rhabdoviridae under the order Mononegavirales) 
by sequencing of partial nucleoprotein (N) gene of rabies virus and phylogenetic 
analysis to know the genotype and lineage of rabies virus present in Gujarat 
state of India. A total of 32 samples (18 brain samples and 14 saliva samples) 
were aseptically collected from live and dead animals (viz. dog, buffalo, cow, 
goat, donkey and hyena) for rabies virus detection. Out of 32 samples, 24 
samples were found positive by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactions 
and from these 24 positive samples, 20 samples were selected for sequencing 
having good concentration of gene product. ClustalW alignment of nucleotide 
sequences and amino acid sequences of field rabies isolates revealed 95.20-100 
and 97.95-100% similarity among themselves, respectively. Multiple sequence 
alignment of field rabies isolates and reference vaccine strains [Pasteur strain 
and Challenge Virus Strain (CVS)] indicated single nucleotide mutations at total 
91 positions and amino acid mutations at total 17 different positions. 
Phylogenetic analysis of N gene sequences using our 20 field rabies isolates and 
21 other reported isolates in Genbank resulted in 3 phylogenetic clusters. All 
the field rabies isolates showed same genetic lineage among themselves and with 
other earlier reported Indian rabies isolates placing them in Arctic like 
lineage of Genotype 1 Rabies virus. However, they were at genetic distance with 
reference Pasteur and CVS strains, which grouped in different phylogenetic 
cluster.

"Epidemiology of two human protoparvoviruses, bufavirus and tusavirus","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Two human parvoviruses were recently discovered by metagenomics in Africa, bufavirus (BuV) in 2012 and tusavirus (TuV) in 2014. These viruses have been studied exclusively by PCR in stool and detected only in patients with diarrhoea, although at low prevalence. Three genotypes of BuV have been identified. We detected, by in-house EIA, BuV1-3 IgG antibodies in 7/228 children (3.1%) and 10/180 adults (5.6%), whereas TuV IgG was found in one child (0.4%). All children and 91% of the adults were Finnish, yet interestingly 3/6 adults of Indian origin were BuV-IgG positive. By competition EIA, no cross-reactivity between the BuVs was detected, indicating that the BuV genotypes represent distinct serotypes. Furthermore, we analysed by BuV qPCR stool and nasal swab samples from 955 children with gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, or both, and found BuV DNA in three stools (0.3%) and for the first time in a nasal swab (0.1%). This is the first study documenting the presence of BuV and TuV antibodies in humans. Although the seroprevalences of both viruses were low in Finland, our results indicate that BuV infections might be widespread in Asia. The BuV-specific humoral immune responses appeared to be strong and long-lasting, pointing to systemic infection in humans.</jats:p>",0

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of a highly contagious 
disease that results in severe economic losses to the global poultry industry. 
The virus exists in a wide variety of genetically distinct viral types, and both 
phylogenetic analysis and measures of pairwise similarity among nucleotide or 
amino acid sequences have been used to classify IBV strains. However, there is 
currently no consensus on the method by which IBV sequences should be compared, 
and heterogeneous genetic group designations that are inconsistent with 
phylogenetic history have been adopted, leading to the confusing coexistence of 
multiple genotyping schemes. Herein, we propose a simple and repeatable 
phylogeny-based classification system combined with an unambiguous and rationale 
lineage nomenclature for the assignment of IBV strains. By using complete 
nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene we determined the phylogenetic structure of 
IBV, which in turn allowed us to define 6 genotypes that together comprise 32 
distinct viral lineages and a number of inter-lineage recombinants. Because of 
extensive rate variation among IBVs, we suggest that the inference of 
phylogenetic relationships alone represents a more appropriate criterion for 
sequence classification than pairwise sequence comparisons. The adoption of an 
internationally accepted viral nomenclature is crucial for future studies of IBV 
epidemiology and evolution, and the classification scheme presented here can be 
updated and revised novel S1 sequences should become available.

Genetic typing and prevalence of Border disease virus (BDV) in small ruminant

Universidad de León, León, Spain.

Between 2001 and 2002, samples from 1,413 animals in 21 Spanish small ruminant 
flocks, most of them with animals showing clinical signs compatible with Border 
disease (BD), were screened for the presence of Pestivirus antigen and 
antibodies by an indirect peroxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) and the virus 
neutralization test (VNT), respectively. Although all flocks harboured 
seropositive animals, virus could only be isolated from animals in five of the 
flocks. Between 4 and 11 months later all animals older than 6 months in three 
of the flocks were resampled. At this time, 51-83% of them had neutralizing 
antibodies. The prevalence of persistently infected (PI) animals within two of 
the flocks was 0.3 and 0.6%, respectively. The third flock presumably had 
eliminated all the PI animals. Fourteen virus isolates were obtained. The 5' 
untranslated region (5'UTR) was amplified by RT-PCR and directly sequenced. 
Phylogenetic analyses classified them as a group of Border disease viruses 
(BDV), separated from BDV-1, but showing a relatively low bootstrap value. Three 
of the 14 isolates were in the same subgroup as a set of formerly characterised 
Spanish isolates from the Basque Country, which were allocated to subgroup 
BDV-C. In addition, they were in the group with an isolate from chamois, which 
is currently allocated in group BDV-4. Because of its close relation to the 
chamois isolate, these isolates were tentatively reallocated in a subgroup 
BDV-4a. The remaining isolates generated a new subgroup, related but not in the 
same cluster as the chamois isolate, and was therefore tentatively assigned to a 
new subgroup BDV-4b. Our results show that classification and nomenclature of 
BDV needs to be harmonised.

"Interspecies transmission of Rotaviruses among ruminants, dogs and humans: Current facts and remarks","<jats:p>Rotaviruses are considered to be a major cause of diarrhoea to humans as well as a wide variety of animals and may cause serious economic losses in livestock animals, especially swine and ruminants. This fact, along with the genetic diversity that characterizes members of the Rotavirus group, raised concerns regarding the potential of virus interspecies transmission among various species of animals and humans. Regarding the presence and the epidemiology of Rotaviruses in ruminants in association with closely related humans and dogs, research is limited and few data have been presented in recent years. In this review we present all the latest information regarding the distribution of genotypes of Rotavirus strains in ruminants, dogs and humans.</jats:p>",0
Anaplasma marginale Superinfection Attributable to Pathogen Strains with Distinct Genomic Backgrounds,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Strain superinfection occurs when a second pathogen strain infects a host already infected with a primary strain. The selective pressures that drive strain divergence, which underlies superinfection, and allow penetration of a new strain into a host population are critical knowledge gaps relevant to shifts in infectious disease epidemiology. In regions of endemicity with a high prevalence of infection, broad population immunity develops against

We used next generation sequencing on random amplified viral nucleic acids to 
determine the genome sequence of 11 pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) 
isolates from Belgium (period 1998-2011). The PPMV-1 deep sequence data allowed 
identification of sequence variability in multiple PPMV-1 isolates, including 
one STOP codon in the Matrix gene which was present in 15% of the viral 
population of one isolate. Notably, mutations that were previously associated 
with pathogenicity in chickens were identified as minor sequence variants in one 
parent laboratory strain. A phylogenetic analysis of the consensus PPMV-1 genome 
sequences was performed. In addition to providing nearly complete paramyxovirus 
genome sequences, our sequence-independent approach identified the presence of 
pigeon circovirus (PiCV) sequences in four of these viral stocks. Real-time 
quantitative RT-PCR analysis specific for PMV-1 and PiCV showed that these 
contaminations were present in seven viral stocks consisting of allantoic fluids 
and was occasionally also detected in stocks passaged in embryonated chicken 
eggs. Phylogenetic analysis of the PiCV consensus genome sequences showed a 
circulation of PiCV covering the full genetic diversity of known PiCV. This 
study shows the value of novel sequence independent technologies for access to 
sequence information for the control of reference virus stocks and other 
biological materials, as co-infecting viruses or sequence variants from the 
original sample may persist in the stocks without being identified by the 
routine virus-specific diagnostic tools. The exact role of PiCV in pigeon 
disease - in particular Newcastle disease - and its potential interference with 
PPMV-1 diagnostics remains to be investigated.

Using random high-throughput RNA sequencing, the complete coding sequence of a 
novel picorna-like virus (a 9,228-nt contig containing 212,202 reads) was 
determined from a blackbird (Turdus merula) infected with Usutu virus. This 
sequence shares only 36% amino acid sequence identity with its closest homolog, 
arivirus 1, (an unclassified member of the order Picornavirales), and shares its 
dicistronic genome arrangement. The new virus was therefore tentatively named 
""blackbird arilivirus"" (ari-like virus). The nearly complete genome sequence 
consists of at least 9,228 nt and contains two open reading frames (ORFs) 
encoding the nonstructural polyprotein (2235 amino acids) and structural 
polyprotein (769 amino acids). Two TaqMan RT-qPCR assays specific for ORF1 
confirmed the presence of high levels of this novel virus in the original 
sample. Nucleotide composition analysis suggests that blackbird arilivirus is of 
dietary (plant) origin.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is globally distributed, transmitted enterically and 
between humans and animals. Phylogenetic analysis has identified five distinct 
HEV genotypes. The first full-length sequence of an African strain (Chad) is 
presented and compared to 31 complete HEV genomes available, including the 
fulminant hepatitis strain from India, swine strains and a strain from Morocco. 
The two African strains are more closely related to genotype 1 than to any other 
genotypes and together they possibly form a sub-genotype or sixth genotype. The 
first evidence for recombination between divergent HEV strains is presented.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is classified within the family Hepeviridae, genus 
Hepevirus. HEV genotype 3 (Gt3) infections are endemic in pigs in Western Europe 
and in North and South America and cause zoonotic infections in humans. Several 
serological assays to detect HEV antibodies in pigs have been developed, at 
first mainly based on HEV genotype 1 (Gt1) antigens. To develop a sensitive HEV 
Gt3 ELISA, a recombinant baculovirus expression product of HEV Gt3 open reading 
frame-2 was produced and coated onto polystyrene ELISA plates. After incubation 
of porcine sera, bound HEV antibodies were detected with anti-porcine anti-IgG 
and anti-IgM conjugates. For primary estimation of sensitivity and specificity 
of the assay, sets of sera were used from pigs experimentally infected with HEV 
Gt3. For further validation of the assay and to set the cutoff value, a batch of 
1100 pig sera was used. All pig sera were tested using the developed HEV Gt3 
assay and two other serologic assays based on HEV Gt1 antigens. Since there is 
no gold standard available for HEV antibody testing, further validation and a 
definite setting of the cutoff of the developed HEV Gt3 assay were performed 
using a statistical approach based on Bayes' theorem. The developed and 
validated HEV antibody assay showed effective detection of HEV-specific 
antibodies. This assay can contribute to an improved detection of HEV antibodies 
and enable more reliable estimates of the prevalence of HEV Gt3 in swine in 
different regions.

"Complete nucleotide sequence of the new simian T-lymphotropic virus, STLV-PH969 from a Hamadryas baboon, and unusual features of its long terminal repeat","<jats:p>A third type of primate T-lymphotropic virus, PTLV-L, with STLV-PH969 as a prototype, has recently been isolated from an African baboon (Papio hamadryas). Classification of this virus has been based on partial sequence analysis of cDNA from a virus-producing cell line, PH969. We obtained the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus with a proviral genome of 8,916 bp. All major genes, homologous in all human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-related viruses, and their corresponding mRNAs, including appropriate splicing, were identified. One additional nonhomologous open reading frame in the proximal pX region is accessible for translation through alternative splicing. Sequence comparison shows that STLV-PH969 is equidistantly related to HTLV type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2. In all coding regions, the similarity tends to be the lowest between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-1. However, in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region, the lowest similarity was found between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-2. The U3-R and R-U5 boundaries of the STLV-PH969 LTR were experimentally determined at nucleotides 268 and 524, respectively. This 695-bp LTR is 60 and 73 bp shorter than the LTRs of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively, but its general organization is similar to the one found in the HTLV-bovine leukemia virus genus. In the long region between the polyadenylation signal and the poly(A) site, sequence similarity with the HTLV-1 Rex-responsive element (RexRE) core and secondary structure prediction suggest the presence of a RexRE. The presence of three 21-bp repeats is conserved within the U3 region of HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and BLV. Only two direct repeats with similarity to these Tax-responsive elements were found in the STLV-PH969 LTR, which might suggest differences in the Tax-mediated transactivation of this virus. We conclude that STLV-PH969 has all the genes and genomic regions to suggest a replication cycle comparable to that of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.</jats:p>",0

The Leader and 3C proteinases of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) are 
responsible for almost all the proteolytic processing events of the viral 
polyprotein precursor. Investigation into the genetic heterogeneity of the 
regions encoding these proteins from isolates of six FMDV serotypes revealed the 
3C proteinase to be more conserved than the Leader proteinase. Maximum 
likelihood analysis indicated similar phylogenetic groupings for the 
non-structural protein coding regions of both the Leader and 3C. These groupings 
were different from the structural VP1 protein coding region which, as shown 
previously, grouped according to serotype. Two distinct clades were apparent for 
both the Leader and 3C coding regions: one comprising of serotypes A, O and C 
together with SAT (South African Territories) isolates from eastern Africa. The 
other clade consisted of SAT isolates originating from southern Africa. Only one 
virus isolate, obtained from a buffalo in Uganda, did not conform to this 
phylogenetic pattern. This SAT 1 virus grouped with types A, O and C in the 
Leader analysis, but with the southern African SAT types in the 3C analysis, 
implicating intertypic recombination. The leader proteinases of southern African 
SAT type isolates differed from those present in European type isolates, 
particularly in the self-processing region. A three-dimensional structure was 
modeled for the Leader proteinase of one of the SAT type viruses, ZIM/7/83/2, 
and compared with the previously elucidated crystal structure of O(1)Kaufbeuren 
Leader proteinase. The active sites of the two leaders were found to superimpose 
closely, despite the observed sequence variation between the two molecules. 
Comparison of the 3C proteinase P1 cleavage sites suggested that the FMDV 3C 
proteinase may possess a broader substrate specificity, as observed in hepatitis 
A virus 3C proteinase.

Origin of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus: a comparative genomic analysis.

To test the avian-origin hypothesis of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus we 
surveyed influenza sequences from a broad taxonomic distribution and collected 
65 full-length genomes representing avian, human and ""classic"" swine H1N1 
lineages in addition to numerous other swine (H1N2, H3N1, and H3N2), human 
(H2N2, H3N2, and H5N1), and avian (H1N1, H4N6, H5N1, H6N1, H6N6, H6N8, H7N3, 
H8N4, H9N2, and H13N2) subtypes. Amino acids from all eight segments were 
concatenated, aligned, and used for phylogenetic analyses. In addition, the 
genes of the polymerase complex (PB1, PB2, and PA) were analyzed individually. 
All of our results showed the Brevig-Mission/1918 strain in a position basal to 
the rest of the clade containing human H1N1s and were consistent with a 
reassortment hypothesis for the origin of the 1918 virus. Our genome phylogeny 
further indicates a sister relationship with the ""classic"" swine H1N1 lineage. 
The individual PB1, PB2, and PA phylogenies were consistent with 
reassortment/recombination hypotheses for these genes. These results demonstrate 
the importance of using a complete-genome approach for addressing the 
avian-origin hypothesis and predicting the emergence of new pandemic influenza 
strains.

An Ecological and Conservation Perspective on Advances in the Applied Virology of Zoonoses,"<jats:p>The aim of this manuscript is to describe how modern advances in our knowledge of viruses and viral evolution can be applied to the fields of disease ecology and conservation. We review recent progress in virology and provide examples of how it is informing both empirical research in field ecology and applied conservation. We include a discussion of needed breakthroughs and ways to bridge communication gaps between the field and the lab. In an effort to foster this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table that lists the definitions of key terms. The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to both assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies. In conclusion, we highlight the need for smart surveillance, viral discovery efforts and predictive modeling. A shift towards a predictive approach is necessary in today’s globalized society because, as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, identification post-emergence is often too late to prevent global spread. Integrating molecular virology and ecological techniques will allow for earlier recognition of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they jump from wildlife reservoirs into human or livestock populations and cause serious public health or conservation issues.</jats:p>",0

Lawsonia intracellularis is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the 
causative agent of proliferative enteropathy (PE). The disease is endemic in 
pigs, emerging in horses and has also been reported in a variety of other animal 
species, including nonhuman primates. Comparing the whole genome sequences of a 
homologous porcine L. intracellularis isolate cultivated for 10 and 60 passages 
in vitro, we identified a 18-kb prophage-associated genomic island in the 
passage 10 (pathogenic variant) that was lost in the passage 60 (non-pathogenic 
variant). This chromosomal island comprises 15 genes downstream from the 
prophage DLP12 integrase gene. The prevalence of this genetic element was 
evaluated in 12 other L. intracellularis isolates and in 53 infected animals and 
was found to be conserved in all porcine isolates cultivated for up to 20 
passages and was lost in isolates cultivated for more than 40 passages. 
Furthermore, the prophage region was also present in 26 fecal samples derived 
from pigs clinically affected with both acute and chronic forms of the disease. 
Nevertheless, equine L. intracellularis isolates evaluated did not harbor this 
genomic island regardless of the passage in vitro. Additionally, fecal samples 
from 21 clinically affected horses and four wild rabbits trapped in horse farms 
experiencing PE outbreaks did not show this prophage-associated island. Although 
the presence of this prophage-associated island was not essential for a virulent 
L. intracellularis phenotype, this genetic element was porcine isolate-specific 
and potentially contributed to the ecological specialization of this organism 
for the swine host.

There is an increasing body of evidence that hepatitis E virus (HEV) triggers 
acute hepatitis not only in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, 
and America with low sanitary standards but also in highly industrialized 
countries. We here report on two patients from Thuringia (Germany) with a HEV 
infection without a recent stay abroad. All other common causes of hepatitis 
were excluded. Transaminases were significantly increased in both cases, while 
icterus could be proven in one patient, only. Both patients fully recovered in 
the long-term course. Epidemiological and phylogenetic data from viral analyses 
suggest that HEV infection has to be considered as a zoonosis. It is likely that 
viral transmission from animals to humans occurs through insufficiently cooked 
meat or entrails, e. g., from pigs or wild animals. In summary, HEV infection is 
a relevant differential diagnosis in acute non-A/B/C viral hepatitis. Further 
studies are required for the identification of other transmission pathways, 
pathogen reservoirs as well as novel concepts for prophylaxis, especially for 
patients at risk for hepatic diseases.

In this study we report for the first time the phylodynamics of the parapoxvirus 
(PPV) genus in Mexico. Based on the analysis by PCR of 124 epithelial samples 
collected between 2007 and 2011 from naturally infected goats, sheep and cows in 
Mexico, we found that different PPV were present in 21 out of the 24 states 
sampled during this study. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of 
different PPV species in Mexico, and their phylogenetic relationship with other 
PPV circulating in the US and Canada. Furthermore, we describe the existence of 
two different ORFV phylogenetic groups that are clearly host associated (sheep 
or goat). Evidence of directional selection at five specific amino acid residues 
in the enveloped glycoprotein B2L might help to support this host predilection. 
Collectively, the results generated in this study highlight the importance of 
PPV genus in Mexico and open the possibility for future studies describing with 
more detail the importance of this genus in North America.

Avian Influenza Viruses in Wild Birds: Virus Evolution in a Multihost Ecosystem,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Wild ducks and gulls are the major reservoirs for avian influenza A viruses (AIVs). The mechanisms that drive AIV evolution are complex at sites where various duck and gull species from multiple flyways breed, winter, or stage. The Republic of Georgia is located at the intersection of three migratory flyways: the Central Asian flyway, the East Africa/West Asia flyway, and the Black Sea/Mediterranean flyway. For six complete study years (2010 to 2016), we collected AIV samples from various duck and gull species that breed, migrate, and overwinter in Georgia. We found a substantial subtype diversity of viruses that varied in prevalence from year to year. Low-pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) subtypes included H1N1, H2N3, H2N5, H2N7, H3N8, H4N2, H6N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N1, H9N3, H10N4, H10N7, H11N1, H13N2, H13N6, H13N8, and H16N3, and two highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs) belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, H5N5 and H5N8, were found. Whole-genome phylogenetic trees showed significant host species lineage restriction for nearly all gene segments and significant differences in observed reassortment rates, as defined by quantification of phylogenetic incongruence, and in nucleotide sequence diversity for LPAIVs among different host species. Hemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses, which circulated in Eurasia during 2014 and 2015, did not reassort, but analysis after their subsequent dissemination during 2016 and 2017 revealed reassortment in all gene segments except NP and NS. Some virus lineages appeared to be unrelated to AIVs in wild bird populations in other regions, with maintenance of local AIVs in Georgia, whereas other lineages showed considerable genetic interrelationships with viruses circulating in other parts of Eurasia and Africa, despite relative undersampling in the area.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Waterbirds (e.g., gulls and ducks) are natural reservoirs of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and have been shown to mediate the dispersal of AIVs at intercontinental scales during seasonal migration. The segmented genome of influenza viruses enables viral RNA from different lineages to mix or reassort when two viruses infect the same host. Such reassortant viruses have been identified in most major human influenza pandemics and several poultry outbreaks. Despite their importance, we have only recently begun to understand AIV evolution and reassortment in their natural host reservoirs. This comprehensive study illustrates AIV evolutionary dynamics within a multihost ecosystem at a stopover site where three major migratory flyways intersect. Our analysis of this ecosystem over a 6-year period provides a snapshot of how these viruses are linked to global AIV populations. Understanding the evolution of AIVs in the natural host is imperative to mitigating both the risk of incursion into domestic poultry and the potential risk to mammalian hosts, including humans.

by suid herpesvirus 1, also called pseudorabies virus (PRV). In several European 
countries, including Belgium, the virus has successfully been eradicated from 
the domestic swine population. The presence of PRV in the wild boar population 
however poses a risk for possible reintroduction of the virus into the domestic 
pig population. It is therefore important to assess the genetic relatedness 
between circulating strains and possible epidemiological links. In this study, 
nine historical Belgian domestic swine isolates that circulated before 1990 and 
five recent wild boar isolates obtained since 2006 from Belgium and the Grand 
Duchy of Luxembourg were genetically characterized by restriction fragment 
length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and phylogenetic analysis. While all wild 
boar isolates were characterized as type I RFLP genotypes, the RFLP patterns of 
the domestic swine isolates suggest that a shift from genotype I to genotype II 
might have occurred in the 1980s in the domestic population. By phylogenetic 
analysis, Belgian wild boar isolates belonging to both clade A and B were 
observed, while all domestic swine isolates clustered within clade A. The joint 
phylogenetic analysis of both wild boar and domestic swine strains showed that 
some isolates with identical sequences were present within both populations, 
raising the question whether these strains represent an increased risk for 
reintroduction of the virus into the domestic population.

"The Capacity of UL49.5 Proteins To Inhibit TAP Is Widely Distributed among Members of the Genus
            <i>Varicellovirus</i>","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            The lifelong infection by varicelloviruses is characterized by a fine balance between the host immune response and immune evasion strategies used by these viruses. Virus-derived peptides are presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transports the peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum, where the loading of MHC-I molecules occurs. The varicelloviruses bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), pseudorabies virus, and equid herpesviruses 1 and 4 have been found to encode a UL49.5 protein that inhibits TAP-mediated peptide transport. To investigate to what extent UL49.5-mediated TAP inhibition is conserved within the family of
            <jats:italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</jats:italic>
            , the homologs of another five varicelloviruses, one mardivirus, and one iltovirus were studied. The UL49.5 proteins of BoHV-5, bubaline herpesvirus 1, cervid herpesvirus 1, and felid herpesvirus 1 were identified as potent TAP inhibitors. The varicella-zoster virus and simian varicellovirus UL49.5 proteins fail to block TAP; this is not due to the absence of viral cofactors that might assist in this process, since cells infected with these viruses did not show reduced TAP function either. The UL49.5 homologs of the mardivirus Marek's disease virus 1 and the iltovirus infectious laryngotracheitis virus did not block TAP, suggesting that the capacity to inhibit TAP via UL49.5 has been acquired by varicelloviruses only. A phylogenetic analysis of viruses that inhibit TAP through their UL49.5 proteins reveals an interesting hereditary pattern, pointing toward the presence of this capacity in defined clades within the genus

Metagenomics detection and characterisation of viruses in faecal samples from Australian wild birds,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We present an optimised metagenomics method for detection and characterisation of all virus types including single and double stranded DNA/RNA and enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Initial evaluation included both spiked and non-spiked bird faecal samples as well as non-spiked human faecal samples. From the non-spiked bird samples (Australian Muscovy duck and Pacific black ducks) we detected 21 viruses, and we also present a summary of a few viruses detected in human faecal samples. We then present a detailed analysis of selected virus sequences in the avian samples that were somewhat similar to known viruses, and had good quality (Q20 or higher) and quantity of next-generation sequencing reads, and was of interest from a virological point of view, for example, avian coronavirus and avian paramyxovirus 6. Some of these viruses were closely related to known viruses while others were more distantly related with 70% or less identity to currently known/sequenced viruses. Besides detecting viruses, the technique also allowed the characterisation of host mitochondrial DNA present and thus identifying host species, while ribosomal RNA sequences provided insight into the “ribosomal activity microbiome”; of gut parasites; and of food eaten such as plants or insects, which we correlated to non-avian host associated viruses.</jats:p>",0
Metagenomic Analyses of Viruses in Stool Samples from Children with Acute Flaccid Paralysis,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            We analyzed viral nucleic acids in stool samples collected from 35 South Asian children with nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Sequence-independent reverse transcription and PCR amplification of capsid-protected, nuclease-resistant viral nucleic acids were followed by DNA sequencing and sequence similarity searches. Limited Sanger sequencing (35 to 240 subclones per sample) identified an average of 1.4 distinct eukaryotic viruses per sample, while pyrosequencing yielded 2.6 viruses per sample. In addition to bacteriophage and plant viruses, we detected known enteric viruses, including rotavirus, adenovirus, picobirnavirus, and human enterovirus species A (HEV-A) to HEV-C, as well as numerous other members of the
            <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>
            family, including parechovirus, Aichi virus, rhinovirus, and human cardiovirus. The viruses with the most divergent sequences relative to those of previously reported viruses included members of a novel

Determining the prevalences and pathogenicities of the novel genotypes, species, genera, and potential new viral families identified in this study in different demographic groups will require further studies with different demographic and patient groups, now facilitated by knowledge of these viral genomes.

Viral Nucleic Acids in Live-Attenuated Vaccines: Detection of Minority Variants and an Adventitious Virus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Metagenomics and a panmicrobial microarray were used to examine eight live-attenuated viral vaccines. Viral nucleic acids in trivalent oral poliovirus (OPV), rubella, measles, yellow fever, varicella-zoster, multivalent measles/mumps/rubella, and two rotavirus live vaccines were partially purified, randomly amplified, and pyrosequenced. Over half a million sequence reads were generated covering from 20 to 99% of the attenuated viral genomes at depths reaching up to 8,000 reads per nucleotides. Mutations and minority variants, relative to vaccine strains, not known to affect attenuation were detected in OPV, mumps virus, and varicella-zoster virus. The anticipated detection of endogenous retroviral sequences from the producer avian and primate cells was confirmed. Avian leukosis virus (ALV), previously shown to be noninfectious for humans, was present as RNA in viral particles, while simian retrovirus (SRV) was present as genetically defective DNA. Rotarix, an orally administered rotavirus vaccine, contained porcine circovirus-1 (PCV1), a highly prevalent nonpathogenic pig virus, which has not been shown to be infectious in humans. Hybridization of vaccine nucleic acids to a panmicrobial microarray confirmed the presence of endogenous retroviral and PCV1 nucleic acids. Deep sequencing and microarrays can therefore detect attenuated virus sequence changes, minority variants, and adventitious viruses and help maintain the current safety record of live-attenuated viral vaccines.</jats:p>",0

Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) is an emerging virus associated with a number of 
different syndromes in pigs known as Porcine Circovirus Associated Diseases 
(PCVAD). Since its identification and characterization in the early 1990s, PCV-2 
has achieved a worldwide distribution, becoming endemic in most pig-producing 
countries, and is currently considered as the main cause of losses on pig farms. 
In this study, we analyzed the main routes of the spread of PCV-2 between 
pig-producing countries using phylogenetic and phylogeographical approaches. A 
search for PCV-2 genome sequences in GenBank was performed, and the 420 PCV-2 
sequences obtained were grouped into haplotypes (group of sequences that showed 
100% identity), based on the infinite sites model of genome evolution. A 
phylogenetic hypothesis was inferred by Bayesian Inference for the 
classification of viral strains and a haplotype network was constructed by 
Median Joining to predict the geographical distribution of and genealogical 
relationships between haplotypes. In order to establish an epidemiological and 
economic context in these analyses, we considered all information about PCV-2 
sequences available in GenBank, including papers published on viral isolation, 
and live pig trading statistics available on the UN Comtrade database 
(http://comtrade.un.org/). In these analyses, we identified a strong correlation 
between the means of PCV-2 dispersal predicted by the haplotype network and the 
statistics on the international trading of live pigs. This correlation provides 
a new perspective on the epidemiology of PCV-2, highlighting the importance of 
the movement of animals around the world in the emergence of new pathogens, and 
showing the need for effective sanitary barriers when trading live animals.

BACKGROUND: Preliminary studies showed the prevalence of a virus similar to 
human hepatitis B virus (HBV-like) in swine from farms in China and the 
molecular evidence of Hepadnavirus infection in domestic pigs herds in Brazil. 
In this study, we genetically characterize the swine Hepadnavirus strains in 
swine from slaughterhouses located in certified abattoirs from Rio de Janeiro 
State, Brazil and evaluate its hepatotropic potential.
RESULTS: Bile and liver samples from swine were positive for partial genome 
amplification (ORF S and ORF C), direct sequencing and viral load 
quantification. Sequencing of the gene encoding the surface antigen allowed 
classification of Hepadnavirus into genotypes, similar to HBV genotype 
classification. Indirect immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of HBsAg 
antigen in liver tissue sections.
CONCLUSIONS: So far our data suggest that commercial swine house an HBV-like 
virus and this relevant finding should be considered in studies on the origin 
and viral evolution.

The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus, currently circulating 
in Asia, causes severe disease in domestic poultry as well as wild birds like 
crow. However, the molecular pathogenesis of HPAIV infection in crows and other 
wild birds is not well known. Thus, as a step to explore it, a comprehensive 
global gene expression analysis was performed on crow lungs, infected with HPAI 
H5N1 crow isolate (A/Crow/India/11TI11/2011) using high throughput next 
generation sequencing (NGS) (GS FLX Titanium XLR70). The reference genome of 
crow is not available, so RNA seq analysis was performed on the basis of a de 
novo assembled transcriptome. The RNA seq result shows, 4052 genes were 
expressed uniquely in noninfected, 6277 genes were expressed uniquely in HPAIV 
infected sample and of the 6814 genes expressed in both samples, 2279 genes were 
significantly differentially expressed. Our transcriptome profile data allows 
for the ability to understand the molecular mechanism behind the recent lethal 
HPAIV outbreak in crows which was, until recently, thought to cause lethal 
infections only in gallinaceous birds such as chickens, but not in wild birds. 
The pattern of differentially expressed genes suggest that this isolate of H5N1 
virus evades the host innate immune response by attenuating interferon 
(IFN)-inducible signalling possibly by down regulating the signalling from type 
I IFN (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and type II IFN receptors, upregulation of the 
signalling inhibitors suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3 and 
altering the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs). This may be the reason 
for disease and mortality in crows.

Atypical bovine pestiviruses are related antigenically and phylogenetically to 
bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV-1 and BVDV-2), and may cause the same 
clinical manifestations in animals. Glycoprotein E(rns) of an atypical bovine 
pestivirus Th/04_KhonKaen was produced in a baculovirus expression system and 
was purified by affinity chromatography. The recombinant E(rns) protein was used 
as an antigen in a microsphere immunoassay for the detection of antibodies 
against BVDV-1 and atypical bovine pestivirus. The diagnostic performance of the 
new method was evaluated by testing a total of 596 serum samples, and the assay 
was compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Based on the 
negative/positive cut-off median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of 2800, the 
microsphere immunoassay had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% 
compared to ELISA. The immunoassay was able to detect antibodies against both 
BVDV-1 and the atypical pestivirus. This novel microsphere immunoassay has the 
potential to be multiplexed for simultaneous detection of antibodies against 
different bovine pathogens in a high-throughput and economical way.

Complete Genomic Sequence of Human Coronavirus OC43: Molecular Clock Analysis Suggests a Relatively Recent Zoonotic Coronavirus Transmission Event,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of approximately 30 kb. Based on genetic similarities, coronaviruses are classified into three groups. Two group 2 coronaviruses, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), show remarkable antigenic and genetic similarities. In this study, we report the first complete genome sequence (30,738 nucleotides) of the prototype HCoV-OC43 strain (ATCC VR759). Complete genome and open reading frame (ORF) analyses were performed in comparison to the BCoV genome. In the region between the spike and membrane protein genes, a 290-nucleotide deletion is present, corresponding to the absence of BCoV ORFs ns4.9 and ns4.8. Nucleotide and amino acid similarity percentages were determined for the major HCoV-OC43 ORFs and for those of other group 2 coronaviruses. The highest degree of similarity is demonstrated between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV in all ORFs with the exception of the E gene. Molecular clock analysis of the spike gene sequences of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 suggests a relatively recent zoonotic transmission event and dates their most recent common ancestor to around 1890. An evolutionary rate in the order of 4 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup>nucleotide changes per site per year was estimated. This is the first animal-human zoonotic pair of coronaviruses that can be analyzed in order to gain insights into the processes of adaptation of a nonhuman coronavirus to a human host, which is important for understanding the interspecies transmission events that led to the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak.</jats:p>",0

Specific PCR primers were selected to amplify a 359 bp DNA fragment flanking the 
3'-part of the polymerase gene and the 3'-noncoding (3'-NC) region of the genome 
of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). In RT-PCR the selected fragment was 
amplified from the genomes of 27 viral strains collected from Europe, America 
and Asia over a period of a half century as well as from three vaccine strains 
of CSFV. Eight PCR products were sequenced using an automatic sequencing device. 
Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed by computer programs DNASTAR and 
PHYLIP. The comparative studies revealed that the 3'-NC region contains a 
variable region of nucleotides which is located immediately after the stop codon 
TGA or TAA. Furthermore, a strongly conserved constant region was identified 
near to the extreme 3'-terminus. Two imperfect repeated sequences were found 
both in the variable and in the constant regions. In addition, the variable 
region was characterized by the occurrence of a 50 bp long poly AT track. 
Phylogenetic analysis with different mathematical approaches (MegAlign, 
Neighbor-Joining method, Maximum Likelihood, Parsimony) revealed that the 
studied CSFV strains were clustered into two main phylogenetic groups. Group I 
was comprised of the reference strain Brescia, together with old American and 
European field isolates and a Brazilian vaccine strain. Group II included the 
reference strain Alfort (Tübingen) and recent European field strains. The 
Congenital Tremor strain formed a distinct lineage which, although being highly 
divergent, was more closely related to group I than to group II. In conclusion, 
the present phylogenetic grouping yielded very similar results as previous 
studies base on comparison of the E2 (gp55) region. The agreement of the 
phylogenetic analysis in the two distinct regions confirms the reliability of 
the genetic grouping of CSFV strains into two main genogroups.

Genetic typing of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is important for the 
precise classification of viruses as well as for the development of molecular 
epidemiology. BVDV isolates were usually typed based on comparison of genomic 
sequences from the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), N(pro) and E2 region. 
Recently we have identified 11 genetic groups (subgenotypes) of BVDV-1. Our 
further experiments confirmed a new subgenotype, BVDV-1k, isolated from cattle 
in Switzerland. BVDV isolates from India were typed as BVDV-1b whereas BVDV-1c 
is a predominant subgenotype in Australia. The results of genetic typing of BVDV 
indicate that distribution of subgenotypes has no relationship to the geographic 
origin of viral isolates.

To characterise the bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) isolates circulating in 
the southeastern region of Austria, namely in the province of Styria, 71 blood 
samples collected between 1998 and 2000 from persistently infected cattle in 62 
herds were subjected to genetic typing. For this, 288bp fragments from the 5' 
untranslated region (5'-UTR) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction after 
reverse transcription (RT-PCR). The products were sequenced and used for 
phylogenetic analysis. Seventy virus isolates were typed as BVDV species 1 
(BVDV-1). Only one isolate was typed as BVDV species 2 (BVDV-2), representing 
the first isolate of this pestivirus genotype found in Austria. In addition, 
phylogenetic analysis revealed that viruses belonging to five genetic groups 
within BVDV-1 are circulating in Styria. Most viruses (53) were found in group 
BVDV-1f, nine viruses in BVDV-1h, four viruses in BVDV-1b, three viruses in 
BVDV-1d and one virus in BVDV-1g. No virus was found in genetic group BVDV-1a, 
which is dominant in the UK and widely distributed in USA. Likewise, the BVDV 
isolates predominating in a neighbouring country, namely Germany, belonged to 
different genogroups than those circulating in Styria. We conclude that in a 
particular region and environment certain BVDV-1 genetic groups predominate. New 
groups, including BVDV-2, can be introduced, e.g. by trade of animals. The low 
incidence of BVDV-2 in Styria is in concert with the sporadic occurrence of 
these viruses in other regions of Europe.

The genetic variability of classical swine fever virus was studied by 
comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of 76 virus isolates, collected during 
a half century from three continents. Parts of the E2 (gp55) and the polymerase 
gene coding regions of the viral genome were amplified by RT-PCR and DNA 
fragments of 254 and 207 bp, respectively, were sequenced. The comparative 
sequence analysis of the E2 region revealed two main phylogenetic groups of 
CSFV, indicating that the virus apparently evolved from two ancestor nodes. 
Group I (represented by Brescia strain) consisted of old and recent American and 
Asian viruses, as well as old English isolates from the 1950s. This group was 
subdivided into three subgroups, termed I.A-I.C. Group II (represented by Alfort 
strain) consisted of relatively recent isolates from Europe, together with 
strain Osaka, which was isolated in Japan from a pig of European origin. Based 
on genetic distances the group was divided into subgroups II.A and II.B. 
Malaysian isolates were branched into both groups, indicating multiple origins 
for contemporaneous outbreaks in that country. All ten vaccine strains tested 
were branched in group I, implying a common ancestor. The Japanese Kanagawa 
strain, isolated in 1974, and the British Congenital Tremor strain from 1964 
were the most distinct variants of CSFV in our collection. The comparison of the 
nucleotide sequences of the polymerase coding region of 32 European strains 
distinguished subgroups II.A and II.B which were similar to the corresponding 
subgroups of the E2 phylogenetic tree. Thus, the results revealed that the E2 
region and the polymerase coding regions seem to be appropriate for the grouping 
of CSFV isolates from all over the world, distinguishing two major groups of the 
virus. The reliability of these regions for phylogenetic analysis is indicated

Hepatitis E Virus Genotype 3 Diversity: Phylogenetic Analysis and Presence of Subtype 3b in Wild Boar in Europe,"<jats:p>An increasing number of indigenous cases of hepatitis E caused by genotype  3 viruses (HEV-3) have been diagnosed all around the word, particularly in industrialized countries. Hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease and accumulating evidence indicates that  domestic pigs and wild boars are the main reservoirs of HEV-3. A detailed analysis of  HEV-3 subtypes could help to determine the interplay of human activity, the role of animals as reservoirs and cross species transmission. Although complete genome sequences are most appropriate for HEV subtype determination, in most cases only partial genomic sequences are available. We therefore carried out a subtype classification analysis, which uses regions from all three open reading frames of the genome. Using this approach, more than 1000 published HEV-3 isolates were subtyped. Newly recovered HEV partial sequences from hunted German wild boars were also included in this study. These sequences were assigned to genotype 3 and clustered within subtype 3a, 3i and, unexpectedly, one of them within the subtype 3b, a first non-human report of this subtype in Europe.</jats:p>",0
Investigation of Human Cancers for Retrovirus by Low-Stringency Target Enrichment and High-Throughput Sequencing,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although nearly one fifth of all human cancers have an infectious aetiology, the causes for the majority of cancers remain unexplained. Despite the enormous data output from high-throughput shotgun sequencing, viral DNA in a clinical sample typically constitutes a proportion of host DNA that is too small to be detected. Sequence variation among virus genomes complicates application of sequence-specific and highly sensitive, PCR methods. Therefore, we aimed to develop and characterize a method that permits sensitive detection of sequences despite considerable variation. We demonstrate that our low-stringency in-solution hybridization method enables detection of &lt;100 viral copies. Furthermore, distantly related proviral sequences may be enriched by orders of magnitude, enabling discovery of hitherto unknown viral sequences by high-throughput sequencing. The sensitivity was sufficient to detect retroviral sequences in clinical samples. We used this method to conduct an investigation for novel retrovirus in samples from three cancer types. In accordance with recent studies our investigation revealed no retroviral infections in human B-cell lymphoma cells, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or colorectal cancer biopsies. Nonetheless, our generally applicable method makes sensitive detection possible and permits sequencing of distantly related sequences from complex material.</jats:p>",0
Experimental infection of conventional nursing pigs and their dams with <i>Porcine deltacoronavirus</i>,"<jats:p> Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly identified virus that has been detected in swine herds of North America associated with enteric disease. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the pathogenicity, course of infection, virus kinetics, and aerosol transmission of PDCoV using 87 conventional piglets and their 9 dams, including aerosol and contact controls to emulate field conditions. Piglets 2–4 days of age and their dams were administered an oronasal PDCoV inoculum with a quantitative real-time reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR quantification cycle (Cq) value of 22 that was generated from a field sample having 100% nucleotide identity to USA/Illinois121/2014 determined by metagenomic sequencing and testing negative for other enteric disease agents using standard assays. Serial samples of blood, serum, oral fluids, nasal and fecal swabs, and tissues from sequential autopsy, conducted daily on days 1–8 and regular intervals thereafter, were collected throughout the 42-day study for qRT-PCR, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Diarrhea developed in all inoculated and contact control pigs, including dams, by 2 days post-inoculation (dpi) and in aerosol control pigs and dams by 3–4 dpi, with resolution occurring by 12 dpi. Mild to severe atrophic enteritis with PDCoV antigen staining was observed in the small intestine of affected piglets from 2 to 8 dpi. Mesenteric lymph node and small intestine were the primary sites of antigen detection by immunohistochemistry, and virus RNA was detected in these tissues to the end of the study. Virus RNA was detectable in piglet fecal swabs to 21 dpi, and dams to 14–35 dpi. </jats:p>",0
Novel hemotropic mycoplasmas are widespread and genetically diverse in vampire bats,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Bats (Order: Chiroptera) have been widely studied as reservoir hosts for viruses of concern for human and animal health. However, whether bats are equally competent hosts of non-viral pathogens such as bacteria remains an important open question. Here, we surveyed blood and saliva samples of vampire bats from Peru and Belize for hemotropic <jats:italic>Mycoplasma</jats:italic> spp. (hemoplasmas), bacteria that can cause inapparent infection or anemia in hosts. 16S rRNA gene amplification of blood showed 67% (150/223) of common vampire bats (<jats:italic>Desmodus rotundus</jats:italic>) were infected by hemoplasmas. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed three novel genotypes that were phylogenetically related but not identical to hemoplasmas described from other (non-vampire) bat species, rodents, humans, and non-human primates. Hemoplasma prevalence in vampire bats was highest in non-reproductive and young individuals, did not differ by country, and was relatively stable over time (i.e., endemic). Metagenomics from pooled <jats:italic>D. rotundus</jats:italic> saliva from Peru detected non-hemotropic <jats:italic>Mycoplasma</jats:italic> species and hemoplasma genotypes phylogenetically similar to those identified in blood, providing indirect evidence for potential direct transmission of hemoplasmas through biting or social contacts. This study demonstrates vampire bats host several novel hemoplasmas and sheds light on risk factors for infection and basic transmission routes. Given the high frequency of direct contacts that arise when vampire bats feed on humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, the potential of these bacteria to be transmitted between species should be investigated in future work.</jats:p>",0

"99th Dahlem Conference on Infection, Inflammation and Chronic Inflammatory Disorders: Farm lifestyles and the hygiene hypothesis","<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>
               <jats:p>About 15 years have gone by since Strachan first proposed the idea that infections and unhygienic contact may confer protection from the development of allergic illnesses. The so-called ‘hygiene hypothesis’ has since undergone numerous modifications in the field of epidemiology, clinical science and immunology. Three main areas of research have been brought forward: to explore the role of overt viral and bacterial infections for the inception of allergic diseases; to investigate the significance of environmental exposure to microbial compounds on the development of allergies; and to study the effect of both exposures on underlying innate and adaptive immune responses. A concept unifying these various aspects has not been found, but various pieces of a complex interplay between immune responses of the host, characteristics of the invading microorganism, the level and variety of the environmental exposure and the interactions between an exposed subject's genetic background and the environmental exposures becomes apparent. A natural experiment relating to the hygiene hypothesis is the recurrent observation of a protective effect of growing up on a farm for asthma and allergies. This has been shown in a large number of epidemiological studies across the world among children and adults. The timing and duration of exposure are likely to play a critical role. The largest reduction in risk has been demonstrated for those exposed prenatally and continuously thereafter until adulthood. The protective factors in these farming environments have not been unravelled completely. Findings from various studies suggest that the contact with farm animals, at least in childhood, confers protection. Also the consumption of unprocessed cow's milk directly from the farm has been shown to protect from childhood asthma and allergies. Increased levels of microbial substances may, at least in part, contribute to the ‘farm effect’. However, only few studies have measured microbial exposures in these environments and the results obtained so far suggest that the underlying protective microbial exposure(s) have not been identified, but a number of studies using metagenomic approaches are currently under way. The mechanisms by which such environmental exposures confer protection from respiratory allergies are also not well understood. There is good evidence for the involvement of innate immune responses, but translation into protective mechanisms for asthma and allergies is lacking. Furthermore, a number of gene × environment interactions have been observed.</jats:p>",0
The Possible Role That Buffalo Played in the Recent Outbreaks of Foot‐and‐Mouth Disease in South Africa,"<jats:p><jats:bold>A<jats:sc>bstract</jats:sc>: </jats:bold> African buffalo (<jats:italic>Syncerus caffer</jats:italic>) act as maintenance hosts for foot‐and‐mouth disease (FMD) in southern Africa. A single buffalo can become infected with all three of the endemic serotypes of FMD virus (SAT‐1, SAT‐2, and SAT‐3) and pose a threat of infection to other susceptible cloven‐hoofed animals. The floods of 2000 in southern Africa damaged the Kruger National Park (KNP) game fence extensively, and there were several accounts of buffalo that had escaped from the park. The VP1 gene, which codes for the major antigenic determinant of the FMD virus, was used to determine phylogenetic relationships between virus isolates obtained from the outbreaks and those previously obtained from buffalo in the KNP. These results demonstrate that buffalo were most probably the source of the outbreaks, indicating that disease control using fencing as well as vaccination is extremely important to ensure that FMD does not become established in domestic livestock.</jats:p>",0

The three serotypes differed from one another by more than 40 % while intratypic variation did not exceed 29%. Within each type, isolates from particular countries were more closely related to one another than to isolates from other countries lending credence to previous observations that FMDV evolve independently in different regions of the subcontinent.</jats:p>",0

Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) causes Gumboro disease, which is highly 
contagious and immunosuppressive in young chickens. A virulent form of IBDV 
reached South Africa in 1989 and to date there has been little molecular 
information available for this strain. In this study, the polyprotein coding 
region of the South African strain SA-KZN95 was sequenced and analysed along 
with 52 representative sequences of other serotype I and II strains. We explored 
the relative impact of recombination on phylogenetic reconstruction using a 
multidimensional scaling approach. Phylogenetic analyses consistently placed the 
South African isolate within the very virulent IBDV clade. Selection analyses 
were also conducted to identify evolutionarily relevant amino acid residues. 
Previously, 19 residues in the polyprotein were shown to be potentially 
diagnostic for the different IBDV pathotypes. This study identified an 
additional two unique residues in the polyprotein which may be used as genetic 
signatures in future viral identifications. Better strain identification would 
aid in the development and application of vaccines.

A Global Genomic Characterization of Nairoviruses Identifies Nine Discrete Genogroups with Distinctive Structural Characteristics and Host-Vector Associations,"<jats:p>Nairoviruses are primarily tick-borne bunyaviruses, some of which are known to cause mild-to-severe febrile illness in humans or livestock. We describe the genome sequences of 11 poorly characterized nairoviruses that have ecological associations with either birds (Farallon, Punta Salinas, Sapphire II, Zirqa, Avalon, Clo Mor, Taggert, and Abu Hammad viruses), rodents (Qalyub and Bandia viruses), or camels (Dera Ghazi Khan virus). Global phylogenetic analyses of proteins encoded in the L, M, and S RNA segments of these and 20 other available nairovirus genomes identified nine well-supported genogroups (Nairobi sheep disease, Thiafora, Sakhalin, Keterah, Qalyub, Kasokero, Dera Ghazi Khan, Hughes, and Tamdy). Genogroup-specific structural variations were evident, particularly in the M segment encoding a polyprotein from which virion envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) are generated by proteolytic processing. Structural variations include the extension, abbreviation, or absence sequences encoding an O-glycosylated mucin-like protein in the N-terminal domain, distinctive patterns of conserved cysteine residues in the GP38-like domain, insertion of sequences encoding a double-membrane-spanning protein (NSm) between the Gn and Gc domains, and the presence of an alternative long open reading frame encoding a viroporin-like transmembrane protein (Gx). We also observed strong genogroup-specific associations with categories of hosts and tick vectors.</jats:p>",0

Metagenomic characterization of water virome was performed in four Mississippi 
catfish ponds. Although differing considerably from African swine fever virus 
(ASFV), 48 of 446,100 sequences from 12 samples were similar enough to indicate 
that they represent new members in the family Asfarviridae. At present, ASFV is 
the only member of Asfarviridae, and this study presents the first indication of 
a similar virus in North America. At this point, there is no indication that the 
identified virus(es) pose a threat to human or animal health, and further study 
is needed to characterize their potential risks to both public health and 
agricultural development.

In China, approximately 20% of the animal original influenza A viruses have 
molecular markers of amantadine resistance. Through phylogenetic data analyses 
and geospatial statistical analyses, this study suggests emergence of amantadine 
resistance in animal influenza could be due to selection pressures in China, for

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) post-transcriptionally regulate a variety of 
genes involved in eukaryotic cell growth, development, metabolism and other 
biological processes, and numerous miRNAs are implicated in the initiation and 
progression of cancer. Enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma (ENA), an epithelial tumor 
induced in goats and sheep by enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), is a chronic, 
progressive, contact transmitted disease.
METHODS: In this work, small RNA Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to 
construct a goat nasal miRNA library. This study aimed to identify novel and 
differentially expressed miRNAs in the tumor and para-carcinoma nasal tissues of 
Nanjiang yellow goats with ENA.
RESULTS: Four hundred six known miRNAs and 29 novel miRNAs were identified. A 
total of 116 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in 
para-carcinoma nasal tissues and ENA (54 downregulated; 60 upregulated; two only 
expressed in control group); Target gene prediction and functional analysis 
revealed that 6176 non-redundancy target genes, 1792 significant GO and 97 
significant KEGG pathway for 121 miRNAs (116 significant expression miRNAs and 
five star sequence) were predicted. GO and KEGG pathway analysis revealed the 
majority of target genes in ENA are involved in cell proliferation, signal 
transduction and other processes associated with cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale identification of miRNAs in Capra 
hircus ENA and provides a theoretical basis for investigating the complicated 
miRNA-mediated regulatory networks involved in the pathogenesis and progression 
of ENA.

BACKGROUND: Animal manure is a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) 
that pose a potential health risk globally, especially for resistance to the 
antibiotics commonly used in livestock production (such as tetracycline, 
sulfonamide, and fluoroquinolone). Currently, the effects of biological 
treatment (composting) on the transcriptional response of manure ARGs and their 
microbial hosts are not well characterized. Composting is a dynamic process that 
consists of four distinct phases that are distinguished by the temperature 
resulting from microbial activity, namely the mesophilic, thermophilic, cooling, 
and maturing phases. In this study, changes of resistome expression were 
determined and related to active microbiome profiles during the dynamic 
composting process. This was achieved by integrating metagenomic and time series 
metatranscriptomic data for the evolving microbial community during composting.
RESULTS: Composting noticeably reduced the aggregated expression level of the 
manure resistome, which primarily consisted of genes encoding for tetracycline, 
vancomycin, fluoroquinolone, beta-lactam, and aminoglycoside resistance, as well 
as efflux pumps. Furthermore, a varied transcriptional response of resistome to 
composting at the ARG levels was highlighted. The expression of tetracycline 
resistance genes (tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS) decreased during composting, where 
distinctive shifts in the four phases of composting were related to variations 
in antibiotic concentration. Composting had no effect on the expression of 
sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone resistance genes, which increased slightly 
during the thermophilic phase and then decreased to initial levels. As 
indigenous populations switched greatly throughout the dynamic composting, the 
core resistome persisted and their reservoir hosts' composition was 
significantly correlated with dynamic active microbial phylogenetic structure. 
Hosts for sulfonamide and fuoroquinolone resistance genes changed notably in 
phylognetic structure and underwent an initial increase and then a decrease in 
abundance. By contrast, hosts for tetracycline resistance genes 
(tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS) exhibited a constant decline through time.
CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptional patterns of a core resistome over the course of 
composting were identified, and microbial phylogeny was the key determinant in 
defining the varied transcriptional response of resistome to this dynamic 
biological process. This research demonstrated the benefits of composting for 
manure treatment. It reduced the risk of emerging environmental contaminants 
such as tetracyclines, tetracycline resistance genes, and clinically relevant 
pathogens carrying ARGs, as well as RNA viruses and bacteriophages.

spectrum of mild and severe HFMD, a comprehensive virome analysis of 238 samples 
was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The data revealed total 
thirteen mammalian- and plant- virus families and diverse viral populations 
including enteroviruses, common respiratory viruses, diarrhea-related viruses, 
plant viruses and anelloviruses. A total of 18 viruses from 7 virus families 
were identified in severe cases, versus 37 viruses from 12 virus families in 
mild cases. Moreover, complicated mixed-infections of enteroviruses with common 
respiratory viruses were mainly found in severe cases(P = 0.013), while 
diarrhea-related viruses were mainly found in mild cases(P < 0.001). This study 
provides the preliminary understanding of viromes both in mild and severe cases, 
which may benefit the detection of etiologic agents and prevention of HFMD.

A Chuzan virus (CHUV), defined as GX871 here, was isolated from blood from a 
sentinel cattle firstly in China, and its full-length genome was sequenced in 
this study. The GX871 genome included 10 segments and 18914 bp, one base fewer 
than the CHUV prototype strain K-47 due to a one-base deletion in the 5' 
non-coding region of segment 8. A frameshift mutation was detected in a short 
coding region (1010-1026 nt) corresponding to the VP1 protein; this frameshift 
resulted in a five-amino acid mutation from 336CVLSY340 to 336YGAKL340. In 
addition, there were a one-base deletion at 1713 nt and a one-base insertion at 
1682 nt in the 3' non-coding region of segment 5. Based on phylogenetic analysis 
of the deduced VP2 amino acid sequences, Palyam serogroup viruses were 
classified into three groups. The Chinese CHUV isolate GX871 was categorized 
into the same group as CHUV prototype strain K-47. The phylogenetic tree was 
divided into three clusters according to the geographical distribution of the 
partial nucleotide sequences of VP7, and this arrangement might define the 
geographical gene pool of CHUV.

BACKGROUND: Free-range cattle are common in the Northeast China area, which have 
close contact with farmers and may carry virus threatening to cattle and 
farmers.
METHODS: Using viral metagenomics we analyzed the virome in plasma samples 
collected from 80 cattle from the forested region of Northeast China.
RESULTS: The virome of cattle plasma is composed of the viruses belonging to the 
families including Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and 
divergent viral genomes showing sequence similarity to circular Rep-encoding 
single stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses. Five such CRESS-DNA genomes were full 
characterized, with Rep sequences related to circovirus and gemycircularvirus. 
Three bovine parvoviruses belonging to two different genera were also 
characterized.
CONCLUSION: The virome in plasma samples of cattle from the forested region of 
Northeast China was revealed, which further characterized the diversity of 
viruses in cattle plasma.

Identification of the Progenitors of Indonesian and Vietnamese Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Viruses from Southern China,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus to Southeast Asian countries triggered the first major outbreak and transmission wave in late 2003, accelerating the pandemic threat to the world. Due to the lack of influenza surveillance prior to these outbreaks, the genetic diversity and the transmission pathways of H5N1 viruses from this period remain undefined. To determine the possible source of the wave 1 H5N1 viruses, we recently conducted further sequencing and analysis of samples collected in live-poultry markets from Guangdong, Hunan, and Yunnan in southern China from 2001 to 2004. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of 73 H5N1 isolates from this period revealed a greater genetic diversity in southern China than previously reported. Moreover, results show that eight viruses isolated from Yunnan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to the clade 1 virus sublineage from Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while two viruses from Hunan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to viruses from Indonesia (clade 2.1). Further phylogenetic analyses of the six internal genes showed that all 10 of those viruses maintained similar phylogenetic relationships as the surface genes. The 10 progenitor viruses were genotype Z and shared high similarity (≥99%) with their corresponding descendant viruses in most gene segments. These results suggest a direct transmission link for H5N1 viruses between Yunnan and Vietnam and also between Hunan and Indonesia during 2002 and 2003. Poultry trade may be responsible for virus introduction to Vietnam, while the transmission route from Hunan to Indonesia remains unclear.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: Newcastle disease (ND) is a devastating worldwide disease of poultry 
characterized by increased respiration, circulatory disturbances, hemorrhagic 
enteritis, and nervous signs. Sequence analysis shows several amino acid residue 
substitutions at neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of recent 
Shaanxi strains. Both Cross protection and cross serum neutralization tests 
revealed that the traditional vaccine strains were unable to provide full 
protection for the flocks.
METHODS: To better understand the epidemiology of Newcastle disease outbreak, a 
portion of the F gene and the full-length HN gene were amplified from Shaanxi 
isolates by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and then 
conducted sequence and phylogenetic analyzes. In pathogenicity analysis, both 
high intra-cerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and mean death time (MDT) tests 
of chicken embryo were carried out. Furthermore, a cross-protection experiment 
in which specific-pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain 
were challenged by the recent Shaanxi strain was also performed.
RESULTS: Nine Newcastle disease (ND) virus (NDV) isolates which were recovered 
from ND outbreaks in chicken flocks in China were genotypically and 
pathotypically characterized. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that all the 
recent Shaanxi-isolated NDVs have (112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117) for the C-terminus of 
the F2 protein and exhibit high ICPI and MDT of chicken embryos, suggesting that 
they were all classified as velogenic type of NDVs. Phylogenetic analysis of 
these isolates showed that they belong to subgenotype VIId that have been 
implicated in the recent outbreaks in northwestern China. The percentage of 
amino acid sequence identity of F protein between recent Shaanxi stains and five 
vaccine strains was in the range of 81.9 %-88.1 %, while the percentage of amino 
acid sequence identity of HN protein between recent Shaanxi strains and vaccine 
strains was in the range of 87.4 %-91.2 %. Furthermore, a number of amino acid 
residue substitutions at neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of these 
isolates were observed, which may lead to the change of antibody recognition and 
neutralization capacity. A cross-protection experiment indicated that 
specific-pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain was not 
capable of providing full protection for the flocks that were challenged by the 
recent Shaanxi strain.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings reveal that recent Shannxi NDVstrains 
exhibit antigenic variations that could be responsible for recent outbreaks of 
NDVs in northwestern China.

The nucleotide sequences of the complete VP1, VP0, VP3, and partial 3D regions 
of seven duck hepatitis virus (DHV) serotype 1 (DHV-1) strains isolated in China 
between 2001 and 2007 and one DHV-1 strain originally obtained from ATCC were 
determined and compared with previously available DHV sequences in GenBank. 
Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of VP1 sequences demonstrated three distinct 
genetic groups. There was an excellent concordance among the genetic groups 
assigned based on the complete VP0, VP3, and the partial 3D regions. In view of 
the growing importance of molecular techniques in diagnosis, we propose that the 
three genetic groups should be termed DHV types A, B, and C. All DHV-1 strains 
grouped in genotype A, whereas the new serotype strains isolated in Taiwan and 
the new serotype strains isolated in South Korea clustered into genotypes B and 
C, respectively, suggesting a potential genetic correlates of serotype. In 
pairwise comparisons of complete VP1, VP0, and VP3 nucleotide and amino acid 
sequences and the partial 3D nucleotide sequence, DHVs of the same genotype were 
clearly distinguished from those of heterologous genotypes. Analysis of the 
amino acid sequences of the three capsid proteins demonstrated the presence of 
conserved elements that form the eight-stranded beta-barrel structures, as well 
as intervening domains that vary in sequence between strains of different 
genotypes as seen in other picorna viruses.

Knowledge of the mi<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">RNA</jats:styled-content>s affected by poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of viral double‐stranded <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">RNA</jats:styled-content>, in porcine airway epithelial cells (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PAEC</jats:styled-content>s) contributes to understanding the mechanisms of swine viral respiratory diseases, which bring enormous economic loss worldwide every year. In this study, we used high throughput sequencing to profile mi<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">RNA</jats:styled-content> expression in <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PAEC</jats:styled-content>s treated with poly(I:C) as compared to the untreated control.

Nineteen of the 23 mi<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">RNA</jats:styled-content>s were down‐regulated including members of the miR‐17‐92 cluster, a well‐known polycistronic oncomir and extensively involved in viral infection in humans.

A large quantity of sequence variations (isomiRs) were found including a substitution at position 5, which was verified to redirect mi<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">RNA</jats:styled-content>s to a new spectrum of targets by luciferase reporter assay together with bioinformatics analysis. Twelve novel porcine mi<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">RNA</jats:styled-content>s conserved in other species were identified by homology analysis together with cloning verification. Furthermore, the expression analysis revealed the potential importance of three novel mi<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">RNA</jats:styled-content>s in porcine immune response to viruses. Overall, our data contribute to clarifying the mechanisms underlying the host immune response against respiratory viruses in pigs, and enriches the repertoire of porcine mi<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">RNA</jats:styled-content>s.</jats:p>",0
Isolation of a Reassortant H1N2 Swine Flu Strain of Type “Swine-Human-Avian” and Its Genetic Variability Analysis,"<jats:p>We isolated an influenza strain named A/Swine/Fujian/F1/2010 (H1N2) from a pig suspected to be infected with swine flu. The results of electron microscopy, hemagglutination (HA) assay, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and whole genome sequencing analysis suggest that it was a reassortant virus of swine (H1N1 subtype), human (H3N2 subtype), and avian influenza viruses. To further study the genetic evolution of A/Swine/Fujian/F1/2010 (H1N2), we cloned its whole genome fragments using RT-PCR and performed phylogenetic analysis on the eight genes. As a result, the nucleotide sequences of HA, NA, PB1, PA, PB2, NP, M, and NS gene are similar to those of A/Swine/Shanghai/1/2007(H1N2) with identity of 98.9%, 98.9%, 99.0%, 98.6%, 99.0%, 98.9%, 99.3%, and 99.3%, respectively. Similar to A/Swine/Shanghai/1/2007(H1N2), we inferred that the HA, NP, M, and NS gene fragments of A/Swine/Fujian/F1/2010 (H1N2) strain were derived from classical swine influenza H3N2 subtype, NA and PB1 were derived from human swine influenza H3N2 subtype, and PB2 and PA genes were derived from avian influenza virus. This further validates the role of swine as a “mixer” for influenza viruses.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUNDS: The Enterovirus genus of the family of Picornaviridae consists of 9 
species of Enteroviruses and 3 species of Rhinoviruses based on the latest virus 
taxonomy. Those viruses contribute significantly to respiratory and digestive 
disorders in human and animals. Out of 9 Enterovirus species, Enterovirus E-G 
are closely related to diseases affecting on livestock industry. While 
enterovirus infection has been increasingly reported in cattle and swine, the 
enterovirus infections in small ruminants remain largely unknown.
METHODS: Virology, molecular and bioinformatics methods were employed to 
characterize a novel enterovirus CEV-JL14 from goats manifesting severe diarrhea 
with morbidity and mortality respectively up to 84% and 54% in China.
RESULTS: CEV-JL14 was defined and proposed as a new Enterovirus species L within 
the genus of Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. CEV-JL14 had a complete 
genome sequence of 7461 nucleotides with an ORF encoding 2172 amino acids, and 
shared 77.1% of genomic sequence identity with TB4-OEV, an ovine enterovirus. 
Comparison of 5'-UTR and structural genes of CEV-JL14 with known Enterovirus 
species revealed highly genetic variations among CEV-JL14 with known Enterovirus 
species. VP1 nucleotide sequence identities of CEV-14 were 51.8%-53.5% with 
those of Enterovirus E and F, 30.9%-65.3% with Enterovirus G, and 43.8-51. 5% 
with Enterovirus A-D, respectively. CEV-JL14 was proposed as a novel species 
within the genus of Enterovirus according to the current ICTV demarcation 
criteria of enteroviruses.
CONCLUSIONS: CEV-JL14 clustered phylogenetically to neither Enterovirus E and F, 
nor to Enterovirus G. It was defined and proposed as novel species L within the 
genus of Enterovirus. This is the first report of caprine enterovirus in China, 
the first complete genomic sequence of a caprine enterovirus revealed, and the 
unveiling of significant genetic variations between ovine enterovirus and 
caprine enterovirus, thus broadening the current understanding of enteroviruses.

and Safety Evaluation, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural 
University, Guangzhou, China.

In this study, we examined the types of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) 
possessed by bacteria and bacteriophages in swine feedlot wastewater before and 
after treatment using a metagenomics approach. We found that the relative 
abundance of ARGs in bacterial DNA in all water samples was significantly higher 
than that in phages DNA (>10.6-fold), and wastewater treatment did not 
significantly change the relative abundance of bacterial- or phage-associated 
ARGs. We further detected the distribution and diversity of the different types 
of ARGs according to the class of antibiotics to which they confer resistance, 
the tetracycline resistance genes were the most abundant resistance genes and 
phages were more likely to harbor ATP-binding cassette transporter family and 
ribosomal protection genes. Moreover, the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was 
also detected in the phage population. When assessing the contribution of phages 
in spreading different groups of ARGs, β-lactamase resistance genes had a 
relatively high spreading ability even though the abundance was low. These 
findings possibly indicated that phages not only could serve as important 
reservoir of ARG but also carry particular ARGs in swine feedlot wastewater, and 
this phenomenon is independent of the environment.

          <jats:p>
            Bacteriophage D3112 represents one of two distinct groups of transposable phage found in the clinically relevant, opportunistic pathogen
            <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>
            . To further our understanding of transposable phage in
            <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>
            , we have sequenced the complete genome of D3112. The genome is 37,611 bp, with an overall G+C content of 65%. We have identified 53 potential open reading frames, including three genes (the c repressor gene and early genes A and B) that have been previously characterized and sequenced. The organization of the putative coding regions corresponds to published genetic and transcriptional maps and is very similar to that of enterobacteriophage Mu. In contrast, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has classified D3112 as a λ-like phage on the basis of its morphology. Similarity-based analyses identified 27 open reading frames with significant matches to proteins in the NCBI databases. Forty-eight percent of these were similar to Mu-like phage and prophage sequences, including proteins responsible for transposition, transcriptional regulation, virion morphogenesis, and capsid formation. The tail proteins were highly similar to prophage sequences in
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            and phage Phi12 from
            <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic>
            , while proteins at the right end were highly similar to proteins in
            <jats:italic>Xylella fastidiosa</jats:italic>
            . We performed phylogenetic analyses to understand the evolutionary relationships of D3112 with respect to Mu-like versus λ-like bacteriophages. Different results were obtained from similarity-based versus phylogenetic analyses in some instances. Overall, our findings reveal a highly mosaic structure and suggest that extensive horizontal exchange of genetic material played an important role in the evolution of D3112.

Prevalence of Noroviruses and Sapoviruses in Swine of Various Ages Determined by Reverse Transcription-PCR and Microwell Hybridization Assays,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Noroviruses (NoVs) and sapoviruses (SaVs) are emerging enteric pathogens that cause diarrhea in humans and animals. Porcine genogroup II (GII) NoVs replicate in pigs, but their pathogenesis is undefined. The porcine SaV/GIII/Cowden/80/US strain causes diarrhea and intestinal lesions in pigs. Recently, genetically diverse porcine NoVs (genotypes 11, 18, and 19 within GII) and SaVs comprising at least two genogroups (GIII and GVI?/JJ681-like) and two unclassified strains (G?/QW19 and G?/LL26) were identified; however, their prevalence has not been reported. To investigate the prevalence of porcine NoVs and SaVs, 621 fecal samples were collected from swine of various ages from seven swine farms and one slaughterhouse in three states in the United States. Fecal samples were tested by reverse transcription-PCR and microwell hybridization assays with porcine NoV- and SaV-specific primers and probes, respectively. Porcine GII NoVs were detected exclusively from finisher pigs with an overall prevalence of 20%. Porcine GIII SaVs were detected in 62% of pigs, with the highest prevalence in postweaning pigs and lowest in nursing pigs. Porcine GVI?/JJ681-like SaVs and the G?/QW19-like SaVs were detected infrequently in pigs. The G?/LL26-like SaVs were detected mainly in younger pigs. Because some porcine NoVs and SaVs are genetically or antigenically related to human strains and recombinants within NoVs or SaVs occur for human and pig strains, the high prevalence and subclinical infection rate of these viruses in pigs raise questions of whether pigs may be reservoirs for human strains or for the emergence of new human and porcine recombinants.</jats:p>",0

Individual genes or regions are still commonly used to estimate the phylogenetic 
relationships among viral isolates. The genomic regions that can faithfully 
provide assessments consistent with those predicted with full-length genome 
sequences would be preferable to serve as good candidates of the phylogenetic 
markers for molecular epidemiological studies of many viruses. Here we employed 
a statistical method to evaluate the evolutionary relationships between 
individual viral genes and full-length genomes without tree construction as a 
way to determine which gene can match the genome well in phylogenetic analyses. 
This method was performed by calculation of linear correlations between the 
genetic distance matrices of aligned individual gene sequences and aligned 
genome sequences. We applied this method to the phylogenetic analyses of porcine 
circovirus 2 (PCV2), measles virus (MV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and Japanese 
encephalitis virus (JEV). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for comparisons 
and the possible factors affecting the method accuracy were also discussed in 
the calculations. The results revealed that this method could produce results 
consistent with those of previous studies about the proper consensus sequences 
that could be successfully used as phylogenetic markers. And our results also 
suggested that these evolutionary correlations could provide useful information 
for identifying genes that could be used effectively to infer the genetic 
relationships.

BACKGROUND: The swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) has come to the 
forefront since 2009 and was identified as a new reassortant strain. The 
hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein mediates virus binding, contains antigenic 
regions recognized by neutralizing antibodies, and is associated with viral 
cross-species infection and adaption. The comparison study of codon usage 
preferences in influenza viral genomes was less extensive. In this study, we 
used codon usage pattern analyses to validate the adaption and origins of S-OIV.
METHODS: Codon usage pattern was used to estimate the host adaption of S-OIVs. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene was conducted to understand the phylogeny 
of H1N1 viruses isolated from different hosts. Amino acid signature pattern on 
antigenic sites of HA was analyzed to understand the antigenic characteristics.
RESULTS: Results of phylogenetic analyses of HA gene indicate that S-OIVs group 
in identical clusters. The synonymous codon usage pattern analyses indicate that 
the effective number of codons versus GC content at the third codon position in 
the HA1 gene slightly differ from those in swine H1N1 and gradually adapted to 
human. Our data indicate that S-OIV evolution occurred according to positive 
selection within these antigenic regions. A comparison of antigenic site amino 
acids reveals similar signature patterns between S-OIV and 1918 human influenza 
strains.
CONCLUSION: This study proposes a new and effective way to gain a better 
understanding of the features of the S-OIV genome and evolutionary processes 
based on the codon usage pattern. It is useful to trace influenza viral origins 
and cross-species virus transmission.

"Divergent Pathogenic Properties of Circulating Coxsackievirus A6 Associated with Emerging Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) is an emerging pathogen associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Its genetic characterization and pathogenic properties are largely unknown. Here, we report 39 circulating CV-A6 strains isolated in 2013 from HFMD patients in northeast China. Three major clusters of CV-A6 were identified and related to CV-A6, mostly from Shanghai, indicating that domestic CV-A6 strains were responsible for HFMD emerging in northeast China. Four full-length CV-A6 genomes representing each cluster were sequenced and analyzed further. Bootscanning tests indicated that all four CV-A6-Changchun strains were most likely recombinants between the CV-A6 prototype Gdula and prototype CV-A4 or CV-A4-related viruses, while the recombination pattern was related to, yet distinct from, the strains isolated from other regions of China. Furthermore, different CV-A6 strains showed different capabilities of viral replication, release, and pathogenesis in a mouse model. Further analyses indicated that viral protein 2C contributed to the diverse pathogenic abilities of CV-A6 by causing autophagy and inducing cell death. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report lethal and nonlethal strains of CV-A6 associated with HFMD. The 2C protein region may play a key role in the pathogenicity of CV-A6 strains.</jats:p>

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major and persistent threat to infants and children. Besides the most common pathogens, such as enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), other enteroviruses are increasingly contributing to HFMD. The present study focused on the recently emerged CV-A6 strain. We found that CV-A6 strains isolated in Changchun City in northeast China were associated with domestic origins. These Changchun viruses were novel recombinants of the CV-A6 prototype Gdula and CV-A4. Our results imply that measures to control CV-A6 transmission are urgently needed. Further analyses revealed differing pathogenicities in strains isolated in a neonatal mouse model. One of the possible causes has been narrowed down to the viral protein 2C, using phylogenetic studies, viral sequences, and direct tests on cultured human cells. Thus, the viral 2C protein is a promising target for antiviral drugs to prevent CV-A6-induced tissue damage.

Discovery of a Highly Divergent Coronavirus in the Asian House Shrew from China Illuminates the Origin of the Alphacoronaviruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Although shrews are one of the largest groups of mammals, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). We captured 266 Asian house shrews (
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Suncus murinus</jats:named-content>
            ) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, China, during 2013 to 2015. CoV RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02%. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from the RNA-positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into four lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses but sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel member of the genus
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Alphacoronavirus</jats:named-content>
            , which we denote Wénchéng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to genes of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution.

            The subfamily
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Coronavirinae</jats:named-content>
            contains several notorious human and animal pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Because of their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, it has been proposed that the alphacoronaviruses likely have their ultimate ancestry in the viruses residing in bats. Here, we describe a novel alphacoronavirus (Wénchéng shrew virus [WESV]) that was sampled from Asian house shrews in China. Notably, WESV is a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and possesses an S gene that is genetically distinct from those of all known coronaviruses. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to those of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are important and longstanding hosts for coronaviruses that merit additional research and surveillance.

Genetic characterization of a novel duck-origin picornavirus with six 2A proteins,"<jats:p>A novel virus was detected from diseased ducks and completely determined. The virus was shown to have a picornavirus-like genome layout. Interestingly, the genome contained a total of up to six 2As, including four 2As (2A1–2A4) each having an NPGP motif, an AIG1-like 2A5, and a parechovirus-like 2A6. The 5′UTR was predicted to possess a hepacivirus/pestivirus-like internal ribosome entry site (IRES). However, the subdomain IIIe consisted of a 3 nt stem and five unpaired bases, distinct from those found in all other HP-like IRESs. The virus was most closely related to duck hepatitis A virus, with amino acid identities of 37.7 %, 39 % and 43.7 % in the P1, P2 and P3 regions, respectively. Based on these investigations, together with phylogenetic analyses, the virus could be considered as the founding member of a novel picornavirus genus that we tentatively named ‘Aalivirus’, with ‘Aalivirus A’ as the type species.</jats:p>",0

The emergence of type 1 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 
(PRRSV) has been noticed recently in China. In the present study, the complete 
genomic characterization of a strain of type 1 PRRSV (designated GZ11-G1) was 
described and its pathogenicity for piglets was analyzed. The results showed 
that the complete genome of GZ11-G1 with a size of 15,094 nt, excluding the poly 
(A) tails, shared 80.2-96.3% identity with the representative strains of type 1 
PRRSV, and in particular, it had highest homology (96.3%) with Amervac PRRS, a 
live vaccine virus of type 1 PRRSV and SHE, a rescued virus from an infectious 
clone of Amervac PRRS virus. Compared with the vaccine virus, the nonstructural 
and structural proteins of GZ11-G1 displayed extensive amino acid variations 
except for its ORF5a. GZ11-G1 was clustered with the strains of type 1 PRRSV 
including Cresa3267, Cresa3249, Cresa3256, Olot/91, 9625/2012, ESP-1991-Olot91 
and Amervac PRRS vaccine virus by further phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, 
GZ11-G1 was shown to cause fever, higher viremia and lung and lymph node lesions 
in piglets. Our findings indicate that GZ11-G1 is genetically related to type 1 
PRRSV strains within the cluster formed by Cresa3267, Cresa3249, Cresa3256, 
Olot/91, 9625/2012, ESP-1991-Olot91 and Amervac PRRS vaccine virus, and it is a 
pathogenic for piglets. This study aids in understanding the genetic variation 
and evolution of type 1 PRRSV.

Egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV), a member of the family Adenoviridae and an 
economically important pathogen with a broad host range, leads to markedly 
decreased egg production. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the 
host-EDSV interaction remains unclear. Here, we performed high-throughput RNA 
sequencing (RNA-Seq) to study the dynamic changes in host gene expression at 6, 
12, and 24 hours post-infection in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) infected with 
EDSV. Atotal of 441 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after 
EDSV infection. Gene Ontology category and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs were associated 
with multiple biological functions, including signal transduction, host 
immunity, virus infection, cell apoptosis, cell proliferation, and 
pathogenicity-related and metabolic process signaling pathways. We screened and 
identified 12 DEGs for further examination by using qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR and 
RNA-Seq results were highly consistent. This study analyzed viral infection and 
host immunity induced by EDSV infection from a novel perspective, and the 
results provide valuable information regarding the mechanisms underlying 
host-EDSV interactions, which will prove useful for the future development of 
antiviral drugs or vaccines for poultry, thus benefiting the entire poultry 
industry.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a contagious agent of Newcastle disease in 
avian species and seriously affects the poultry industry. The cleavage site of 
the viral F protein (Fcs) is a key determinant of membrane fusion and viral 
virulence. In this study, we investigated the precise effect of variable amino 
acid sequences of the Fcs on fusogenic activity. Based on viral pathogenicity, 
the Fcs sequences of natural isolates (n = 1572) are classified into eight types 
of virulent Fcs (VFcs) with the motif ""G/R/K-R-Q/R/K-R/K-R↓F"" and ten types of 
the avirulent Fcs (AFcs) with the motif ""G/R/E-R/K/Q-Q-G/E-R↓L"". The VFcs is 
only found in the Class II cluster of viral classification and not in Class I. 
The AFcs exists in both Class I and II isolates. The VFc and AFc types present 
an evolutionary relationship with temporal distribution and host species. Using 
a fusion assay in vitro, VFcs-1 ""RRQKR↓F"" and VFcs-2 ""RRQRR↓F"" show the highest 
efficiency in triggering membrane fusion. The neutral residue Q at the P3 
position of the VFcs plays an enhancing role compared to effect of the basic 
residues R and K. A single residue K at P3 or P5 is less efficient of the 
fusogenic activity in the VFcs with all basic residues. Moreover, the cleavage 
efficiencies of F0 proteins with different types of Fcs motifs do not appear to 
affect membrane fusion. Our findings offer insight into the effect of amino acid 
variation of the Fcs on the fusion triggered by NDV.

Recombination occurs frequently between enteroviruses (EVs) which are classified 
within the same species of the Picornaviridae family. Here, using viral 
metagenomics, the genomes of two recombinant EV-Gs (strains EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014 
and EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014) found in the feces of pigs from a swine farm in China 
are described. The two strains are characterized by distinct insertion of a 
papain-like protease gene from toroviruses classified within the Coronaviridae 
family. According to recent reports the site of the torovirus protease insertion 
was located at the 2C/3A junction region in EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014. For the other 
variant EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014, the inserted protease sequence replaced the entire 
viral capsid protein region up to the VP1/2A junction. These two EV-G strains 
were highly prevalent in the same pig farm with all animals shedding the 
full-length genome (EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014) while 65% also shed the capsid deletion 
mutant (EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014). A helper-defective virus relationship between the 
two co-circulating EV-G recombinants is hypothesized.

Since the sequence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) was determined from a patient with 
enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1989, similar sequences have 
been isolated from many different animals, including pigs, wild boars, deer, 
rabbits, bats, rats, chicken, and trout. All of these sequences have the same 
genomic organization, which contains open reading frames (ORFs) 1, 2, and 3, 
although their genomic sequences are variable. Some have proposed that they be 
classified as new family, Hepeviridae, which would be further divided into 
different genera and species according to their sequence variability. The size 
of these virus particles generally ranged from 27 to 34 nm. However, HEV virions 
produced in cell culture differ in structure from the viruses found in feces. 
Those from cell culture have a lipid envelope and a little ORF3 on their 
surfaces, whereas the viruses isolated from feces lack lipid envelope and ORF3. 
Surprisingly, most of the secreted ORF2 protein from both these sources is not 
associated with HEV RNA.

Among 16 haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), H13 
AIVs have rarely been isolated in wild waterfowl. H13 AIVs cause asymptomatic 
infection and are maintained mainly in gull and tern populations; however, the 
recorded antigenic information relating to the viruses has been limited. In this 
study, 2 H13 AIVs, A/duck/Hokkaido/W345/2012 (H13N2) and 
A/duck/Hokkaido/WZ68/2012 (H13N2), isolated from the same area in the same year 
in our surveillance, were genetically and antigenically analyzed with 10 
representative H13 strains including a prototype strain, 
A/gull/Maryland/704/1977 (H13N6). The HA genes of H13 AIVs were phylogenetically 
divided into 3 groups (I, II, and III). A/duck/Hokkaido/W345/2012 (H13N2) was 
genetically classified into Group III. This virus was distinct from a prototype 
strain, A/gull/Maryland/704/1977 (H13N6), and the virus, 
A/duck/Hokkaido/WZ68/2012 (H13N2), both belonging to Group I. Antigenic analysis 
indicated that the viruses of Group I were antigenically closely related to 
those of Group II, but distinct from those of Group III, including 
A/duck/Hokkaido/W345/2012 (H13N2). In summary, our study indicates that H13 AIVs 
have undergone antigenic diversification in nature.

Antigenic analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 sublineages co-circulating in Egypt,"<jats:p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 has spread across Eurasia and Africa, and outbreaks are now endemic in several countries, including Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt. Continuous circulation of H5N1 virus in Egypt, from a single infected source, has led to significant genetic diversification with phylogenetically separable sublineages, providing an opportunity to study the impact of genetic evolution on viral phenotypic variation. In this study, we analysed the phylogeny of H5 haemagglutinin (HA) genes in influenza viruses isolated in Egypt from 2006 to 2011 and investigated the effect of conserved amino acid mutations in the HA genes in each of the sublineages on their antigenicity. The analysis showed that viruses in at least four sublineages still persisted in poultry in Egypt as of 2011. Using reverse genetics to generate HA-reassortment viruses with specific HA mutations, we found antigenic drift in the HA in two influenza virus sublineages, compared with the other currently co-circulating influenza virus sublineages in Egypt. Moreover, the two sublineages with significant antigenic drift were antigenically distinguishable. Our findings suggested that phylogenetically divergent H5N1 viruses, which were not antigenically cross-reactive, were co-circulating in Egypt, indicating that there was a problem in using a single influenza virus strain as seed virus to produce influenza virus vaccine in Egypt and providing data for designing more efficacious control strategies in H5N1-endemic areas.</jats:p>",0

Members of the Bunyaviridae family are amongst the most widespread viruses in 
the world. They can be found on every inhabited continent at virtually every 
latitude, and are able to infect a wide range of arthropods, plants and mammals 
including humans. More than 300 named viruses are contained within the family 
Bunyaviridae (Virus Taxonomy: Seventh Report of the International Committee on 
Taxonomy of Viruses (2000) 599), and several members cause significant disease 
in humans or domestic animals. Despite being recognised as an emerging threat, 
relatively little is known about their virulence mechanisms. Here, we try to 
summarise the current state of knowledge about how the viruses of the 
Bunyaviridae succeed in establishing infection in the face of a powerful immune 
system.

Domestic dogs share habitats with human, a fact that makes them a potential 
source of zoonotic viruses. Moreover, knowledge regarding possible bloodborne 
pathogens is important due to the increasing application of blood transfusion in 
dogs. In the present study, we evaluated the serum virome of 520 dogs using 
throughput sequencing (HTS). The serum samples were pooled and sequenced using 
an Illumina MiSeq platform. Our unbiased method identified prevalent canine 
pathogens as canine protoparvovirus 1 (canine parvovirus 2), undersearched 
agents as canine bocaparvovirus 1 (minute virus of canines) and canine 
circovirus, circular viruses closely related to viruses recently found in human 
samples, and new parvovirus and anelloviruses. The dog virome described in the 
present work furthers the knowledge concerning the viral population in domestic 
animals. The present data includes information regarding viral agents that are 
potentially transmitted through blood transfusion among dogs.

Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1, reclassified as Pestivirus A, causes an 
economically important cattle disease that is distributed worldwide. Pestivirus 
A may cause persistent infection in that calves excrete the virus throughout 
their lives, spreading the infection in the herd. Many persistently infected 
(PI) calves die in the first 2 years of life from mucosal disease (MD) or 
secondary infections, probably as a consequence of virus-induced immune 
depression. Here, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was applied for evaluation of 
the total virome in sera of (i) PI calves displaying clinically apparent MD 
(n = 8); (ii) PI calves with no signs of MD (n = 8); and (iii) control, 
Pestivirus A-free calves (n = 8). All the groups were collected at the same time 
and from the same herd. Serum samples from calves in each of the groups were 
pooled, submitted to viral RNA/DNA enrichment, and sequenced by HTS. Viral 
genomes of Pestivirus A, Ungulate erythroparvovirus 1, bosavirus (BosV), and 
hypothetical circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses were 
identified. Specific real-time PCR assays were developed to determine the 
frequency of occurrence of such viruses in each of the groups. The absolute 
number of distinct viral genomes detected in both PI calf groups was higher than 
in the control group, as revealed by higher number of reads, contigs, and 
genomes, representing a wider range of taxons. Genomes representing members of 
the family Parvoviridae, such as U. erythroparvovirus 1 and BosV, were most 
frequently detected in all the three groups of calves. Only in MD-affected PI 
calves, we found two previously unreported Hypothetical single-stranded DNA 
genomes clustered along with CRESS-DNA viruses. These findings reveal that 
parvoviruses were the most frequently detected viral genomes in cattle serum; 
its frequency of detection bears no statistical correlation with the status of 
calves in relation to Pestivirus A infection, since clinically normal or 
MD-affected/non-affected PI calves were infected with similar U. 
erythroparvovirus 1 genome loads. Moreover, MD-affected PI calves were shown to 
support viremia of CRESS-DNA viral genomes; however, the meaning of such 
correlation remains to be established.

First Evidence of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Infection in Wild Boars,"<jats:p>Background: The farming of wild boars has growing due to the interest of the human consumption of this exotic meat. Such a development may pose an increased risk of disease transmission between boars and domestic animals. The wild boar population has increased in South America in the last years due the absence of predator causing economic losses due to direct damage to crops and risk of disease transmission. The genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae are composed by four recognized species by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV): classical swine fever virus (CSFV), border disease virus (BDV), bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1) and 2 (BVDV-2). Other putative species denoted as atypical pesitiviruses have been reported as ‘HoBi’-like virus, giraffe pestivirus, Bungowannah pestivirus, Pronghorn antelope virus, atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV), Norwegian rat pestivirus (NrPV) and Rhinolophus affinis bat pestivirus (RaPestV-1). CSFV is commonly detected in wild boars, but despite positive serology, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was never detected in this animal species. Thereby, the present communication describes the first detection of BVDV in the lungs of captive boars using RT-PCR and DNA sequencing.Materials, Methods &amp; Results: Forty lung samples from farmed wild boars were collected after slaughter in a commercial abattoir. The organs were crushed separately, centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored for further analysis. The total RNA was isolated using a phenol-based protocol and RT-PCR protocol that amplified 118 bp of 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) was carried out. One out 40 samples resulted positive. The positive sample had partial fragments of 5’UTR and N terminal autoprotease (Npro) sequenced and analyzed. The strain LV Java/2012 presented 99% of identity in 5’UTR and 98% in Npro region with a BVDV-2 previously reported in bovines in Southern Brazil. In both 5’UTR and Npro phylogenetic analysis, the strain LV Java/2015 clustered with BVDV-2 strains and was most closely related to subtype 2b identified in bovines in Southern Brazil grouping in the same terminal node.Discussion: Wild boars are commonly associated to pathogen transmission to domestic animals. This animal species is considered a reservoir of the pestivirus CSFV and important keys in CSFV control and eradication programs in Europe. Despite indirect presence of BVDV was reported in wild boars by serology tests, the direct detection of the viral agent was never reported. The present study showed the presence of BVDV-2 genomic segments obtained by RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing in captive wild boars. The reported data suggests a possible importance of this animal species in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses which could interfere in control and eradication programs of these important pathogens for cattle worldwide. The strain LV Java/2012 was closely related to BVDV-2b and presented highest identity with a strain detected in cattle from Southern Brazil. This data suggests that wild boars and bovines could be sharing this pathogen due the similarity of the strains and that both were reported in the same region. It can lead to need of inclusion of wild swines in BVDV control programs since boars can circulate between different regions and carry this pathogen to different cattle herds. The present study reported the first molecular evidence of BVDV in wild boars in the literature. The data generated herein suggests a possible importance of boars in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses.</jats:p>",0

Global genetic variation and transmission dynamics of H9N2 avian influenza 
virus.

The H9N2 influenza viruses are extensively circulating in the poultry 
population, and variable genotypes can be generated through mutation, 
recombination and reassortment, which may be better adapted to infect a new 
host, resist drug treatment or escape immune pressure. The LPAI H9N2 viruses 
have the potential to evolve towards high levels of virulence in human. Some 
studies about the regional dispersal were reported, but global dissemination and 
the drivers of the virus are poorly understood, particularly at the genome 
scale. Here, we have analysed all eight gene segments of 168 H9N2 genomes 
sampled randomly aiming to provide a panoramic framework for better 
understanding the genesis and genetic variation of the viruses, and utilized 
phylogeography and spatial epidemiology approaches to uncover the effects of the 
genetic variation, predictors and spread of H9N2 viruses. We found that more 
frequent reassortment events involve segments PA, NP and NS, and 21 isolates 
have possible mosaic structure resulting from recombination events. Estimates of 
gene-specific global dN/dS ratios showed that all genes were subject to 
purifying selection. However, a total of 13 sites were detected under positive 
selection by at least two of three methods, which located within segments HA, 
NA, M2, NS1 and PA. Additionally, we inferred that NA segment has the highest 
rate of nucleotide substitution, and its tMRCA estimate is the youngest than the 
remaining segments' inference. About the spatial history, air transportation of 
human was identified as the predominant driver of global viral migration using 
GLM analysis, and economic factors and geographical distance were the modest 
predictors. Higher migration rates were estimated between five pairs of regions 
(>0.01) indicating the frequent migration of the viruses between discrete 
geographical locations. Further, our Markov jumps analysis showed that viral 
migration is more frequent between Southern China and Northern China, and high 
rate of gene flow was observed between America and East Asia. Moreover, the 
America together with Southeast Asia acted as the primary hubs of global 
transmission, forming the trunk of evolutionary tree. These findings suggested a 
complex interaction between virus evolution, epidemiology and human behaviour.

Circulation of dominant genotypes VI and VII of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is 
causing significant economic losses to the poultry industry in China. However, 
reports of Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks caused by genotype VIII strains of 
NDV are rare. In this study, a virulent genotype VIII strain of NDV, designated 
GXGB2011, was isolated from a vaccinated game fowl flock showing clinic signs of 
infection in Pinxiang county, Guangxi, China. The whole genome of the isolate 
was completely sequenced and was found to be comprised of 15,192 nucleotides 
(nt), encoding the six structural proteins in the order of 3'-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5'. 
The pattern of cleavage site 112 RRQKR↓F117 in the fusion (F) protein and the 
intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) value of 1.5 showed that the strain 
GXGB2011 was a velogenic NDV. The results of the challenge experiment with the 
5-week-old SPF chickens showed that the strain was highly pathogenic with 100% 
morbidity and mortality of the challenged birds. Based on the detection of virus 
in different organs of the infected birds, the highest viral load in caecal 
tonsils was observed and viral levels in immune organs were higher than those in 
the respiratory organs. Bayesian reconstruction of complete genomes based on the 
sequences of 66 NDV reference strains showed that the strain belonged to the 
genotype VIII of NDV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the strain was more 
closely related to the foreign strains gamefowl/U.S.(CA)/24225/98, 1ITTY94060 
and IT-147/94 rather than to the first domestic strains of the emergence 
genotype VIII in Qinghai, China during 1979-1985. In summary, the results of the 
study demonstrated the re-emergence of a highly pathogenic virulent isolate of 
genotype VIII of NDV. These results indicate the risk that this genotype VIII of 
NDV may spread to commercial chickens from game fowl.

Genetic and Pathobiologic Characterization of Pandemic H1N1 2009 Influenza Viruses from a Naturally Infected Swine Herd,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Since its initial identification in Mexico and the United States, concerns have been raised that the novel H1N1 influenza virus might cause a pandemic of severity comparable to that of the 1918 pandemic. In late April 2009, viruses phylogenetically related to pandemic H1N1 influenza virus were isolated from an outbreak on a Canadian pig farm. This outbreak also had epidemiological links to a suspected human case. Experimental infections carried out in pigs using one of the swine isolates from this outbreak and the human isolate A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 showed differences in virus recovery from the lower respiratory tract. Virus was consistently isolated from the lungs of pigs infected with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009, while only one pig infected with A/swine/Alberta/OTH-33-8/2008 yielded live virus from the lung, despite comparable amounts of viral RNA and antigen in both groups of pigs. Clinical disease resembled other influenza virus infections in swine, albeit with somewhat prolonged virus antigen detection and delayed viral-RNA clearance from the lungs. There was also a noteworthy amount of genotypic variability among the viruses isolated from the pigs on the farm. This, along with the somewhat irregular pathobiological characteristics observed in experimentally infected animals, suggests that although the virus may be of swine origin, significant viral evolution may still be ongoing.</jats:p>",0

Coronavirus Pathogenesis and the Emerging Pathogen Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"<jats:sec><jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-strand RNA viruses classified within the Nidovirales order. This coronavirus family consists of pathogens of many animal species and of humans, including the recently isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This review is divided into two main parts; the first concerns the animal coronaviruses and their pathogenesis, with an emphasis on the functions of individual viral genes, and the second discusses the newly described human emerging pathogen, SARS-CoV. The coronavirus part covers (i) a description of a group of coronaviruses and the diseases they cause, including the prototype coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, which is one of the recognized animal models for multiple sclerosis, as well as viruses of veterinary importance that infect the pig, chicken, and cat and a summary of the human viruses; (ii) a short summary of the replication cycle of coronaviruses in cell culture; (iii) the development and application of reverse genetics systems; and (iv) the roles of individual coronavirus proteins in replication and pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV part covers the pathogenesis of SARS, the developing animal models for infection, and the progress in vaccine development and antiviral therapies. The data gathered on the animal coronaviruses continue to be helpful in understanding SARS-CoV.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Avipoxviruses (APVs) belong to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily of the Poxviridae 
family. APVs are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic, pet and 
wild birds of many species. APVs are transmitted by aerosols and biting insects, 
particularly mosquitoes and arthropods and are usually named after the bird 
species from which they were originally isolated. The virus species Fowlpox 
virus (FWPV) causes disease in poultry and associated mortality is usually low, 
but in flocks under stress (other diseases, high production) mortality can reach 
up to 50%. APVs are also major players in viral vaccine vector development for 
diseases in human and veterinary medicine. Abortive infection in mammalian cells 
(no production of progeny viruses) and their ability to accommodate multiple 
gene inserts are some of the characteristics that make APVs promising vaccine 
vectors. Although abortive infection in mammalian cells conceivably represents a 
major vaccine bio-safety advantage, molecular mechanisms restricting APVs to 
certain hosts are not yet fully understood. This review summarizes the current 
knowledge relating to APVs, including classification, morphogenesis, host-virus 
interactions, diagnostics and disease, and also highlights the use of APVs as 
recombinant vaccine vectors.

Protein misfolding and aggregation is a key event in diseases like Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with 
neurodegeneration. Factors that initiate protein misfolding and the role of 
protein aggregation in the pathophysiology of disease pose major challenges to 
the neuroscientific community. Interestingly, although the accumulation of the 
same misfolded protein, e.g., α-synuclein is detectable in all idiopathic PD 
patients, the disease spectrum covers a variety of different clinical 
presentations and disease courses. In a more recent attempt this clinical 
variance is being explained in analogy to prion diseases by different protein 
aggregate conformations. In prion diseases a relationship between protein 
aggregate conformation properties and the clinical disease course was shown by 
relating different prion types to a dementia and an ataxic disease course in 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob patients. This principle is currently transferred to AD, PD 
and other neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation. However, 
differences in protein aggregate conformation are frequently addressed as 
disease strains. The term ""strain"" also derives from prion research and evolved 
by adopting the virus terminology at a time when transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies (TSEs; later called prion diseases) were assumed to be caused 
by a virus. The problem is that in virus taxonomy the term ""type"" refers to 
properties of the disease agent itself and the term ""strain"" refers to host 
associated factors that interact with the disease agent and may moderately 
modify the clinical disease presentation. Strain factors can be discovered only 
after transmission and passaging of the agent in a host of a different species. 
The incorrect use of the terminology confuses disease agent and host factors and 
hampers the understanding of the pathophysiology of protein aggregate-associated 
neurodegenerative diseases. In this review article the discoveries are reviewed 
that explain how the terms ""type"" and ""strain"" emerged for unconventional 
disease agents. This may help to avoid confusion in the terminology of protein 
aggregation diseases and to reflect correctly the impact of protein aggregate 
conformation as well as host factor contribution on different clinical 
variations of AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

A standardised methodology has been used to define genotypes based on pairwise 
sequence comparisons (PASC). PASC is a widely accepted method in virus taxonomy, 
which is based on the histogram of pairwised differences among sequences. 
Recently, Zhang et al. (2013) concluded that the average p-distance of duck 
circovirus (DuCV) between genotypes 1 and 2 was 0.170, and subtype distance 
thresholds were 0.032 in DuCV-1 and 0.018 in DuCV-2, respectively. However, 
there might be some concerns on the methodology application to define the 
genotype of DuCV. Taking into account the concerns mentioned above, our authors 
conducted the PASC analyses of 54 capsid gene (ORF2) and genomic sequences 
including all the sequences from Zhang et al. (2013). Our results confirmed the 
existence of two DuCV genotypes (1 and 2) and, we suggest that DuCV ORF2 and 
genomic distance genotype thresholds were 0.061 and 0.038, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been identified as an emerging cause of 
infectious hepatitis over the last years in developed countries. In contrast to 
travel associated hepatitis E, zoonotic sources of infection are suspected for 
autochthonous cases in Europe.
OBJECTIVE: Since pigs are known reservoirs of HEV, we tested porcine livers sold 
as food in Southeastern Germany for the presence of hepatitis E virus RNA.
STUDY DESIGN: We purchased 200 porcine liver samples in 81 butcher shops and 
grocery stores in Regensburg, Germany. Nucleic acid preparations were tested for 
the presence of HEV RNA by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). HEV isolates 
from positive samples were characterized by partial sequencing of ORF1 and ORF2 
regions in the HEV genome and by phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: Specimens from eight (4%) of 200 purchased pig livers had detectable 
HEV RNA amounts. Sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis allowed two 
novel isolates to be classified as HEV genotype 3, subgenotype 3a (swR437) and 
3c (swR269), respectively. Both novel swine HEV isolates showed high sequence 
homology to isolates obtained from patients with acute HEV infection from the 
same geographic region.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the suggested role of undercooked pig 
products in food as a source of zoonotic HEV infection for humans. It remains to 
be clarified if this mechanism of transmission is responsible for the 
surprisingly high anti-HEV IgG prevalence recently observed in some European 
countries and the USA.

In late 2011, unspecific clinical symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, and 
decreased milk production were observed in dairy cattle in the Dutch/German 
border region. After exclusion of classical endemic and emerging viruses by 
targeted diagnostic systems, blood samples from acutely diseased cows were 
subjected to metagenomics analysis. An insect-transmitted orthobunyavirus of the 
Simbu serogroup was identified as the causative agent and named Schmallenberg 
virus (SBV). It was one of the first detections of the introduction of a novel 
virus of veterinary importance to Europe using the new technology of 
next-generation sequencing. The virus was subsequently isolated from identical 
samples as used for metagenomics analysis in insect and mammalian cell lines and 
disease symptoms were reproduced in calves experimentally infected with both, 
this culture-grown virus and blood samples of diseased cattle. Since its 
emergence, SBV spread very rapidly throughout the European ruminant population 
causing mild unspecific disease in adult animals, but also premature birth or 
stillbirth and severe fetal malformation when naive dams were infected during a 
critical phase of gestation. In the following years, SBV recirculated regularly 
to a larger extend; in the 2014 and 2016 vector seasons the virus was again 
repeatedly detected in the blood of adult ruminants, and in the following winter 
and spring months, a number of malformed calves and lambs was born. The genome 
of viruses present in viremic adult animals showed a very high sequence 
stability; in sequences generated between 2012 and 2016, only a few amino acid 
substitutions in comparison to the initial SBV isolate could be detected. In 
contrast, a high sequence variability was identified in the aminoterminal part 
of the glycoprotein Gc-encoding region of viruses present in the brain of 
malformed newborns. This mutation hotspot is independent of the region or host 
species from which the samples originated and is potentially involved in immune 
evasion mechanisms.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) causes economic losses in 
the pig industry worldwide, and PRRS viruses (PRRSV) are classified into the two 
distinct genotypes ""North American (NA, type 2)"" and ""European (EU, type 1)"". In 
2006, a highly pathogenic NA strain of PRRSV (HP-PRRSV), characterized by high 
fever as well as high morbidity and mortality, emerged in swine farms in China. 
Therefore, a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) 
assay specific for HP-PRRSV was developed and combined with type 1- and type 
2-specific RT-qPCR systems. Furthermore, an internal control, based on a 
heterologous RNA, was successfully introduced. This final multiplex PRRSV 
RT-qPCR, detecting and typing PRRSV, had an analytical sensitivity of less than 
200 copies per µl for the type 1-assay and 20 copies per µl for the type 2- and 
HP assays and a high diagnostic sensitivity. A panel of reference strains and 
field isolates was reliably detected and samples from an animal trial with a 
Chinese HP-PRRS strain were used for test validation. The new multiplex PRRSV 
RT-qPCR system allows for the first time the highly sensitive detection and 
rapid differentiation of PRRSV of both genotypes as well as the direct detection 
of HP-PRRSV.

Phylogenetic relationships among the Paramyxoviridae, a broad family of viruses 
whose members cause devastating diseases of wildlife, livestock, and humans, 
were examined with both fusion (F) and matrix (M) protein-coding sequences. 
Neighbor-joining trees of F and M protein sequences showed that the 
Paramyxoviridae was divided into the two traditionally recognized subfamilies, 
the Paramyxovirinae and the Pneumovirinae. Within the Paramyxovirinae, the 
results also showed groups corresponding to three currently recognized genera: 
Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, and Rubulavirus. The relationships among the three 
genera of the Paramyxovirinae were resolved with M protein sequences and there 
was significant bootstrap support (100%) showing that members of the genus 
Respirovirus and the genus Morbillivirus were more closely related to each other 
than to members of the genus Rubulavirus. Both F and M phylogenies showed that 
Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was more closely related to the genus Rubulavirus 
than to the other two genera but were consistent with the proposal (B. S. Seal 
et al., 2000, Virus Res. 66, 1-11) that NDV be classified as a separate genus 
within the Paramyxovirinae. Both F and M phylogenies were also consistent with 
the proposal (L. Wang et al., 2000, J. Virol 74, 9972-9979) that Hendra virus be 
classified as a new genus closely related and basal to the genus Morbillivirus. 
Rinderpest was most closely related to measles and a more derived virus than to 
canine distemper virus, phocine distemper virus, or dolphin morbillivirus.

AIM: To investigate the initiating causes of cloacitis (inflammation of the 
cloaca) in kakapo (Strigops habroptilus).
METHODS: Metagenomics using unbiased RNA or DNA sequencing was applied to faecal 
material from an 11-year-old female kakapo with exudative cloacitis, and a pool 
of eight birds (male and female aged 1-20 years) with no current signs or 
history of the disease. Faecal material from the diseased bird was collected 
pre- and post-treatment. For RNA sequencing, extracted RNA/DNA was subject to 
DNase, and the remaining RNA reverse transcribed to cDNA and subject to multiple 
displacement amplification prior to sequencing.
RESULTS: No significant alignment to any known avian virus sequence was obtained 
from any faecal samples. However significant BLAST alignments to five 
bacteriophages known to infect enterobacteria were obtained. Strong evidence was 
obtained for the presence of the bacteriophage Escherichia phage TL-2011b, a 
bacteriophage known to occur in Escherichia coli causing outbreaks of foodborne 
disease in humans, in the sample from the diseased bird, but not the 
non-diseased pool. Differences in E. coli community structure between the 
diseased bird and the non-diseased pool were also apparent.
CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli infection of human origin is suggested as a 
possible cause of exudative cloacitis, although confirmatory work is required to 
test this hypothesis.

Circoviruses are circular, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses around 
2000 nucleotides (nt) in length and include the pathogenic species, Porcine 
circovirus 1 and Beak and feather disease virus, capable of causing significant 
morbidity and mortality. This group of viruses may be robust to degradation by 
external environments, and avian circoviruses are known to move between closely 
related hosts. Using a de novo metagenomic approach, followed by confirmatory 
PCR, we identify for the first time a circular Rep-encoding single-stranded 
(CRESS) DNA virus in New Zealand kiwi, Apteryx spp., derived from faecal matter 
of the rowi kiwi (A. rowi) showing signs of verminous dermatitis. The entire 
2085 nt genome was cloned and sequenced and contains both capsid and replicase 
genes, as well as a conserved 9 nt motif. Phylogenetic analyses place it within 
Circoviridae, adjacent to other environmental CRESS-DNA viruses, and most 
closely related to badger circovirus-like virus (Meles meles circovirus-like 
virus). As the rowi is the most critically endangered kiwi, it is vital to 
understand the role of rowi kiwi circovirus-like virus as a possible pathogen 
and also any potential cross-species transmission.

BACKGROUND: Influenza D virus (IDV), a novel influenza virus with proposed 
classification: family Orthomyxoviridae, genus Influenzavirus D, species 
Influenza D virus, has been associated with influenza-like illness in cattle and 
swine. More recently, anti-IDV antibodies have also been detected in small 
ruminants. A seroprevalence of approximately 1.3% has been estimated for the 
general human population.
OBJECTIVES: To gain insights on the zoonotic potential of IDV to human adults 
with occupational exposure to cattle in north central Florida.
STUDY: A cross-sectional serological study was performed on human serum samples 
from 35 cattle-exposed and 11 non-cattle-exposed adults to screen for IDV 
antibodies using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) 
assays.
RESULTS: A seroprevalence of 91% was detected via HI assay, and 97% by MN assay 
among individuals working with cattle in Florida. Among non-cattle-exposed 
individuals, seropositivity determined via MN assay (only) was lower (18%).
CONCLUSIONS: IDV poses a zoonotic risk to cattle-exposed workers, based on 
detection of high seroprevalence (94-97%). Whereas it is still unknown whether 
IDV causes disease in humans, our studies indicate that the virus may be an 
emerging pathogen among cattle-workers.

Characterization of Unknown Orthobunya-Like Viruses from India,"<jats:p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of agents causing idiopathic human diseases has been crucial in the identification of novel viruses. This study describes the isolation and characterization of two novel orthobunyaviruses obtained from a jungle myna and a paddy bird from Karnataka State, India. Using an NGS approach, these isolates were classified as Cat Que and Balagodu viruses belonging to the Manzanilla clade of the Simbu serogroup. Closely related viruses in the Manzanilla clade have been isolated from mosquitos, humans, birds, and pigs across a wide geographic region. Since Orthobunyaviruses exhibit high reassortment frequency and can cause acute, self-limiting febrile illness, these data suggest that human and livestock infections of the Oya/Cat Que/Manzanilla virus may be more widespread and/or under-reported than anticipated. It therefore becomes imperative to identify novel and unknown viruses in order to understand their role in human and animal pathogenesis. The current study is a step forward in this regard and would act as a prototype method for isolation, identification and detection of several other emerging viruses.</jats:p>",0
"Prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis E virus among apparently healthy humans and pigs in Bali, Indonesia: Identification of a pig infected with a genotype 4 hepatitis E virus","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In Indonesia where hepatitis E virus (HEV) is believed to be highly endemic, only three outbreaks of HEV transmission have been documented to date in restricted areas (West Kalimantan and East Java). A total of 1,115 serum samples collected from apparently healthy individuals in Bali, Lombok, and Surabaya in Indonesia in 1996 where epidemic HEV transmissions have never been reported, were tested for IgG class antibodies to HEV (anti‐HEV). In Bali, anti‐HEV was detected in 20% (54/276) of the tested population, in remarkable contrast with 4% (17/446) in Lombok and 0.5% (2/393) in Surabaya. On the other hand, antibodies to hepatitis A virus were highly prevalent in all three regions (95% in Bali, 90% in Lombok, and 89% in Surabaya). Although the majority of the population in Indonesia is Moslem, Balinese people are mostly Hindu and have a habit of consuming pork. Therefore, serum samples were obtained from the 99 farm pigs in Bali and tested for anti‐HEV and HEV RNA. The sera from 71 pigs (72%) were positive for anti‐HEV and a 2‐month‐old pig had detectable HEV RNA. The swine HEV isolate recovered from the viremic pig was named SB66‐Bali. The SB66‐Bali isolate was most closely related to the genotype 4 isolates from China, India, Japan, and Taiwan, but shared only 82.6–90.0% identity in the common 241–412 nucleotides within open reading frame 2 (ORF2). These results indicate that a presumably indigenous HEV strain(s) is circulating in Bali, Indonesia and that HEV infection may occur via zoonosis even in developing countries. J. Med.

Matrix Gene of Influenza A Viruses Isolated from Wild Aquatic Birds: Ecology and Emergence of Influenza A Viruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Wild aquatic birds are the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses, but little is known about the viruses' gene pool in wild birds. Therefore, we investigated the ecology and emergence of influenza viruses by conducting phylogenetic analysis of 70 matrix (M) genes of influenza viruses isolated from shorebirds and gulls in the Delaware Bay region and from ducks in Alberta, Canada, during &gt;18 years of surveillance. In our analysis, we included 61 published M genes of isolates from various hosts. We showed that M genes of Canadian duck viruses and those of shorebird and gull viruses in the Delaware Bay shared ancestors with the M genes of North American poultry viruses. We found that North American and Eurasian avian-like lineages are divided into sublineages, indicating that multiple branches of virus evolution may be maintained in wild aquatic birds. The presence of non-H13 gull viruses in the gull-like lineage and of H13 gull viruses in other avian lineages suggested that gulls' M genes do not preferentially associate with the H13 subtype or segregate into a distinct lineage. Some North American avian influenza viruses contained M genes closely related to those of Eurasian avian viruses. Therefore, there may be interregional mixing of the two clades. Reassortment of shorebird M and HA genes was evident, but there was no correlation among the HA or NA subtype, M gene sequence, and isolation time. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that influenza viruses in wild waterfowl contain distinguishable lineages of M genes.</jats:p>",0

Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is among the most important 
emerging pig diseases worldwide. Initially, the insidious nature of the disease 
made it difficult to pinpoint the pathogen. The presence of porcine circovirus 
type 2 (PCV2) in all PMWS diseased animals led to its acceptance, possibly 
together with an unknown factor, as the causative agent for PMWS. Also, presence 
of PCV2 in healthy individuals did not facilitate the understanding of the 
disease. Phylogenetic classification separates PCV2 viruses into at least two 
major groups. With the aid of a signature motif, a short amino acid motif 
encoded within the capsid protein, the viruses are determined as belonging to 
PCV-2a or PCV-2b. Recently, this classification received more attention, as it 
seemed to define PCV-2b to be more virulent. This simplification, however, could 
not be confirmed experimentally. Hence, we investigated whether virus genetic 
shift was an initiator for the PMWS epizooty in Switzerland. Piglet lymphoid 
tissues from 1973 to 2005 were investigated by histology, immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and PCR. For genotype classification, a sequence amplificate of 137bp was 
used encompassing the signature motif. The onset of Swiss PMWS epizooty 
exhibited a marked shift in PMWS diseased and subclinically infected piglets to 
PCV-2b and specifically to one genotype subgroup. Complementary to these 
observations, healthy piglets also defined by IHC as negative are positive in 
the PCR reaction and are void of any PCV-2b virus during epizooty. Consequently, 
our data support PCV2 genome plasticity as a major contributing factor for PMWS 
disease manifestation.

Picobirnavirus (PBV) is a small, bi-segmented, double-stranded RNA virus. 
Taxonomically, the genus Picobirnavirus belongs to the Picobirnaviridae family. 
PBV infects a wide range of hosts and causes opportunistic infections, but its 
role in diarrheal disease remains unclear. To determine the prevalence and 
genetic diversity of porcine PBVs in Northern Thailand, 380 fecal samples 
collected from diarrheic and non-diarrheic piglets, raised in 22 pig farms, were 
tested for the presence of PBV. Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed 
using primer sets specific to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. PBV 
was detected in 86 of 265 (32.5%) diarrheic piglets and in 26 of 115 (22.6%) 
non-diarrheic piglets. All the PBV strains detected in this study belonged to 
genogroup I and a high proportion of PBV-positive piglets were co-infected with 
group A rotavirus (RVA) and bocavirus (BoV). Phylogenetic analysis of 
representative genogroup I strains revealed remarkably high similarity between 
strains; these formed a monophyletic cluster with 97-100% sequence identity in 
the RdRp gene. The strains were also closely related to genogroup I PBV Chinese 
porcine strain. The findings indicate that PBV infection is common in piglets 
with and without diarrhea in Northern Thailand.

Waterfowl from northwestern Minnesota were sampled by cloacal swabbing for Avian 
Influenza Virus (AIV) from July-October in 2007 and 2008. AIV was detected in 
222 (9.1%) of 2,441 ducks in 2007 and in 438 (17.9%) of 2,452 ducks in 2008. 
Prevalence of AIV peaked in late summer. We detected 27 AIV subtypes during 2007 
and 31 during 2008. Ten hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes were detected each year 
(i.e., H1, 3-8, and 10-12 during 2007; H1-8, 10 and 11 during 2008). All 
neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were detected during each year of the study. Subtype 
diversity varied between years and increased with prevalence into September. 
Predominant subtypes during 2007 (comprising ≥5% of subtype diversity) included 
H1N1, H3N6, H3N8, H4N6, H7N3, H10N7, and H11N9. Predominant subtypes during 2008 
included H3N6, H3N8, H4N6, H4N8, H6N1, and H10N7. Additionally, within each HA 
subtype, the same predominant HA/NA subtype combinations were detected each year 
and included H1N1, H3N8, H4N6, H5N2, H6N1, H7N3, H8N4, H10N7, and H11N9. The 
H2N3 and H12N5 viruses also predominated within the H2 and H12 subtypes, 
respectively, but only were detected during a single year (H2 and H12 viruses 
were not detected during 2007 and 2008, respectively). Mallards were the 
predominant species sampled (63.7% of the total), and 531 AIV were isolated from 
this species (80.5% of the total isolates). Mallard data collected during both 
years adequately described the observed temporal and spatial prevalence from the 
total sample and also adequately represented subtype diversity. Juvenile 
mallards also were adequate in describing the temporal and spatial prevalence of 
AIV as well as subtype diversity.

We noted differences in virome structure that reflected underlying differences in location and influenza A infection status. Red‐necked Avocets (<jats:italic>Recurvirostra novaehollandiae</jats:italic>) from Australia's arid interior possessed the greatest viral diversity and abundance, markedly higher than individuals sampled in temperate Australia. In Ruddy Turnstones (<jats:italic>Arenaria interpres</jats:italic>) and dabbling ducks (<jats:italic>Anas</jats:italic> spp.), viral abundance and diversity were higher and more similar in hosts that were positive for influenza A infection compared to those that were negative for this virus, despite samples being collected on the same day and from the same location.

A Divergent Hepatitis D-Like Agent in Birds,"<jats:p>Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is currently only found in humans and is a satellite virus that depends on hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope proteins for assembly, release, and entry. Using meta-transcriptomics, we identified the genome of a novel HDV-like agent in ducks. Sequence analysis revealed secondary structures that were shared with HDV, including self-complementarity and ribozyme features. The predicted viral protein shares 32% amino acid similarity to the small delta antigen of HDV and comprises a divergent phylogenetic lineage. The discovery of an avian HDV-like agent has important implications for the understanding of the origins of HDV and sub-viral agents.</jats:p>",0

            (house mouse), a globally distributed invasive pest that resides in close contact with humans in urban centers, is largely unexplored. Here, we report analysis of the fecal virome of house mice in residential buildings in New York City, NY. Mice were collected at seven sites in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx over a period of 1 year. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of feces revealed 36 viruses from 18 families and 21 genera, including at least 6 novel viruses and 3 novel genera. A representative screen of 15 viruses by PCR confirmed the presence of 13 of these viruses in liver. We identified an uneven distribution of diversity, with several viruses being associated with specific locations. Higher mouse weight was associated with an increase in the number of viruses detected per mouse, after adjusting for site, sex, and length. We found neither genetic footprints to known human viral pathogens nor antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.

            Mice carry a wide range of infectious agents with zoonotic potential. Their proximity to humans in the built environment is therefore a concern for public health. Laboratory mice are also the most common experimental model for investigating the pathobiology of infectious diseases. In this survey of mice trapped in multiple locations within New York City over a period of 1 year, we found a diverse collection of viruses that includes some previously not associated with house mice and others that appear to be novel. Although we found no known human pathogens, our findings provide insights into viral ecology and may yield models that have utility for clinical microbiology.

The report provides a summary of the presentations and discussions at the Virus 
& TSE Safety Forum 2013 organized by the Parenteral Drug Association (PDA) and 
held in Berlin, Germany, from June 4 to 6, 2013. The conference was accompanied 
by a workshop, ""Virus Spike Preparations and Virus Removal by Filtration: New 
Trends and Developments"". The presentations and the discussion at the workshop 
are summarized in a separate report that will be published in this issue of the 
journal as well. As with previous conferences of this series, the PDA Virus & 
TSE Safety Forum 2013 provided again an excellent opportunity to exchange 
information and opinions between the industry, research organizations, and 
regulatory bodies. Updates on regulatory considerations related to virus and 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) safety of biopharmaceuticals were 
provided by agencies of the European Union (EU), the United States (US), and 
Singapore. The epidemiology and detection methods of new emerging pathogens like 
hepatitis E virus and parvovirus (PARV 4) were exemplified, and the risk of 
contamination of animal-derived raw materials like trypsin was considered in 
particular. The benefit of using new sequence-based virus detection methods was 
discussed. Events of bioreactor contaminations in the past drew the attention to 
root cause investigations and preventive actions, which were illustrated by 
several examples. Virus clearance data of specific unit operations were 
provided; the discussion focused on the mechanism of virus clearance and on the 
strategic concept of viral clearance integration. As in previous years, the 
virus safety section was followed by a TSE section that covered recent 
scientific findings that may influence the risk assessment of blood and cell 
substrates. These included the realization that interspecies transmission of TSE 
by blood components in sheep is greater than predicted by assays in transgenic 
mice. Also, the pathogenesis and possibility of productive TSE infection of cell 
substrates were considered, and cell-based assays that may be suitable for use 
in TSE clearance studies were discussed. The current report provides an overview 
about the outcomes of the 2013 PDA Virus & TSE Safety Forum, a unique event in 
this field.

BACKGROUND: Internet-accessed sexually transmitted infection testing (e-STI 
testing) is increasingly available as an alternative to testing in clinics. 
Typically this testing modality enables users to order a test kit from a virtual 
service (via a website or app), collect their own samples, return test samples 
to a laboratory, and be notified of their results by short message service (SMS) 
or telephone. e-STI testing is assumed to increase access to testing in 
comparison with face-to-face services, but the evidence is unclear. We conducted 
a randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of an e-STI testing 
and results service (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HIV, and syphilis) on STI testing 
uptake and STI cases diagnosed.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study took place in the London boroughs of Lambeth and 
Southwark. Between 24 November 2014 and 31 August 2015, we recruited 2,072 
participants, aged 16-30 years, who were resident in these boroughs, had at 
least 1 sexual partner in the last 12 months, stated willingness to take an STI 
test, and had access to the internet. Those unable to provide consent and unable 
to read English were excluded. Participants were randomly allocated to receive 1 
text message with the web link of an e-STI testing and results service 
(intervention group) or to receive 1 text message with the web link of a bespoke 
website listing the locations, contact details, and websites of 7 local sexual 
health clinics (control group). Participants were free to use any other services 
or interventions during the study period. The primary outcomes were 
self-reported STI testing at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks, and 
self-reported STI diagnosis at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks. 
Secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants prescribed treatment for 
an STI, time from randomisation to completion of an STI test, and time from 
randomisation to treatment of an STI. Participants were sent a £10 cash 
incentive on submission of self-reported data. We completed all follow-up, 
including patient record checks, by 17 June 2016. Uptake of STI testing was 
increased in the intervention group at 6 weeks (50.0% versus 26.6%, relative 
risk [RR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.15, P < 0.001). The proportion of participants 
diagnosed was 2.8% in the intervention group versus 1.4% in the control group 
(RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.70, P = 0.079). No evidence of heterogeneity was 
observed for any of the pre-specified subgroup analyses. The proportion of 
participants treated was 1.1% in the intervention group versus 0.7% in the 
control group (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.16, P = 0.231). Time to test, was 
shorter in the intervention group compared to the control group (28.8 days 
versus 36.5 days, P < 0.001, test for difference in restricted mean survival 
time [RMST]), but no differences were observed for time to treatment (83.2 days 
versus 83.5 days, P = 0.51, test for difference in RMST). We were unable to 
recruit the planned 3,000 participants and therefore lacked power for the 
analyses of STI diagnoses and STI cases treated.
CONCLUSIONS: The e-STI testing service increased uptake of STI testing for all 
groups including high-risk groups. The intervention required people to attend 
clinic for treatment and did not reduce time to treatment. Service innovations 
to improve treatment rates for those diagnosed online are required and could 
include e-treatment and postal treatment services. e-STI testing services 
require long-term monitoring and evaluation.

Classification of Marek's disease viruses according to pathotype: philosophy and methodology,"1. Avian Pathol. 2005 Apr;34(2):75-90. doi: 10.1080/03079450500059255.

The concept of pathotype in Marek's disease (MD) probably dates from the 
recognition of a more virulent form of the disease in the late 1950s (Benton & 
Cover, 1957). Distinctions between MD virus strains were further expanded with 
the description of the vv pathotype in the early 1980s and of the vv+ pathotype 
in the 1990s. Pathotype designations reflect important biological properties 
that correlate with the break-through of vaccinal immunity in the field. 
However, pathotyping methods applied by various laboratories have not been 
uniform, preventing critical comparison of results. Better uniformity of 
pathotyping procedures is desirable.The Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory 
(ADOL) method is based on induction of lymphoproliferative lesions in vaccinated 
chickens. This method has been used to pathotype more than 45 isolates and is 
the basis for the current pathotype classification of MD virus strains. Its 
limitations include requirements for a specific type of chickens (15x7 ab+), 
large numbers of animals, and a statistical method to compare lesion responses 
to those of JM/102W and Md5 control strains. Because of these limitations, it 
has not been and is not likely to be used in other laboratories. Comparability 
in pathotyping can be improved by the comparison of field isolates with standard 
prototype strains such as JM/102W, Md5 and 648A (American Type Culture 
Collection) or their equivalents. Data may be generated by different in vivo 
procedures that measure tumour induction, neurological disease (both neoplastic 
and non-neoplastic lesions), or solely non-neoplastic criteria (such as lymphoid 
organ weights or virus replication). Methods based on neoplastic criteria, 
especially when generated in MD-immunized chickens, will probably correlate most 
closely with that of the ADOL method and be most relevant to evolution of MD 
virus in the field. Based on data from several trials, a modification of the 
ADOL method that utilizes fewer chickens and can be conducted with commercial 
specific pathogen free strains is proposed. The modified method is based on 
""best fit"" comparisons with prototype strains, and is expected to provide 
results generally comparable with the original method. A variety of other 
alternative criteria (see earlier) are also evaluated both for primary 
pathotyping and as adjuncts to other pathotyping methods. Advantages and 
disadvantages of alternative methods are presented.

Microbial source tracking (MST) tools are used to identify sources of fecal 
pollution for accurately assessing public health risk and implementing best 
management practices (BMPs). This review focuses on the potential of enteric 
viruses for MST applications. Following host infection, enteric viruses 
replicate and are excreted in high numbers in the hosts' feces and urine. Due to 
the specificity in host infection, enteric viruses have been considered one of 
the most accurate library-independent culture-independent MST tools. In an 
assessment of molecular viral assays based on sensitivity, specificity and the 
density of the target virus in fecal-impacted samples, human adenovirus and 
human polyomavirus were found to be the most promising human-specific viral 
markers. However, more research is needed to identify promising viral markers 
for livestock because of cross-reactions that were observed among livestock 
species or the limited number of samples tested for specificity. Other viral 
indicators of fecal origin, F+ RNA coliphage and pepper mild mottle virus, have 
also been proposed as potential targets for developing MST markers. Enhancing 
the utility of enteric viruses for MST applications through next generation 
sequencing (NGS) and virus concentration technology is discussed in the latter 
part of this review. The massive sequence databases generated by shotgun and 
gene-targeted metagenomics enable more efficient and reliable design of MST 
assays. Finally, recent studies revealed that alternative virus concentration 
methodologies may be more cost-effective than standard technologies such as 
1MDS; however, improvements in the recovery efficiency and consistency are still 
needed. Overall, developments in metagenomic information combined with efficient 
concentration methodologies, as well as high host-specificity, make enteric 
viruses a promising tool in MST applications.

Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.

The cDNAs of classical swine fever virus (LPC vaccine strain) were cloned by 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and their nucleotide sequences were 
determined. In this work, we obtained the sequence information of the 786 bases 
of the 5'-terminal region, 6049 bases of the middle region, and 1648 bases of 
the 3'-terminal region. Taking our previous results and present data together, 
the entire genomic sequence of LPC strain was completed (12344 nucleotides in 
length). The genome of LPC has a large open reading frame that can encode a 
polypetide of 3897 amino acids, and are flanked by untranslated regions (UTR), 
373 bases at the 5'-end and 278 bases at the 3'-end. Phylogenetic analysis based 
on genomic sequences of several viruses suggested that the LPC strain is closer 
to Chinese, Riems, HCLV, Alfort/187, Brescia, and Alfort strains in order. After 
further analysis, we found that an insertion of 13 nucleotides, 
TTT(C/T)CTTTTTTTT, in the 3'-UTR of LPC, Chinese, and HCLV strains. Immediately 
downstream to the 13 nucleotides, a unique sequence of LPC consisting of 28 
thymidine was observed.

Neutralizing DNA Aptamers against Swine Influenza H3N2 Viruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Triple reassortant influenza A viruses (IAVs) of swine, particularly the North American H3N2 subtype, circulate in swine herds and may reassort and result in the emergence of novel zoonotic strains. Current diagnostic tools rely on isolation of the viruses, followed by serotyping by hemagglutination or genome sequencing, both of which can be expensive and time-consuming. Thus, novel subtype-specific ligands and methods are needed for rapid testing and subtyping of IAVs in the field. To address this need, we selected DNA aptamers against the recombinant HA protein from swine IAV H3 cluster IV using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Four candidate aptamers (HA68, HA7, HA2a, and HA2b) were identified and characterized. The dissociation constants (
            <jats:italic>K</jats:italic>
            <jats:sub>
              <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>
            </jats:sub>
            ) of aptamers HA68, HA7, HA2a, and HA2b against recombinant H3 protein were 7.1, 22.3, 16.0, and 3.7 nM, respectively. The binding site of HA68 to H3 was identified to be between nucleotide residues 8 and 40. All aptamers inhibited H3 hemagglutination. HA68 was highly specific to all four lineages within the North American H3N2 subtype. Further, the other three aptamers specifically identified live viruses belonging to the phylogenetic clusters I, II/III, and IV especially the virus that closely related to the recent H3N2 variant (H3N2v). Aptamer HA68 was also able to bind and detect H3N2v isolated from recent human cases. In conclusion, we provide subtype-specific aptamers against H3N2 IAVs of swine that can now be used in rapid detection and typing protocols for field applications.

Resolving <i>Bovine viral diarrhea virus</i> subtypes from persistently infected U.S. beef calves with complete genome sequence,"<jats:p> Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified into 2 genotypes, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, each of which contains distinct subtypes with genetic and antigenic variation. To effectively control BVDV by vaccination, it is important to know which subtypes of the virus are circulating and how their prevalence is changing over time. Accordingly, the purpose of our study was to estimate the current prevalence and diversity of BVDV subtypes from persistently infected (PI) beef calves in the central United States. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5′-UTR (5′ untranslated region) for 119 virus strains revealed that a majority (82%) belonged to genotype 1b, and the remaining strains were distributed between genotypes 1a (9%) and 2 (8%); however, BVDV-2 subtypes could not be confidently resolved. Therefore, to better define the variability of U.S. BVDV isolates and further investigate the division of BVDV-2 isolates into subtypes, complete genome sequences were obtained for these isolates as well as representatives of BVDV-1a and -1b. Phylogenetic analyses of the complete coding sequence provided more conclusive genetic classification and revealed that U.S. BVDV-2 isolates belong to at least 3 distinct genetic groups that are statistically supported by both complete and individual coding gene analyses. These results show that a more complex set of BVDV-2 subtypes has been circulating in this region than was previously thought. </jats:p>",0
Revised and updated nomenclature for highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses,"<jats:p>The divergence of the hemagglutinin gene of A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996‐lineage H5N1 viruses during 2011 and 2012 (807 new sequences collected through December 31, 2012) was analyzed by phylogenetic and p‐distance methods to define new clades using the pre‐established nomenclature system. Eight new clade designations were recommended based on division of clade 1·1 (Mekong River Delta), 2·1·3·2 (Indonesia), 2·2·2 (India/Bangladesh), 2·2·1·1 (Egypt/Israel), and 2·3·2·1 (Asia). A simplification to the previously defined criteria, which adds a letter rather than number to the right‐most digit of fifth‐order clades, was proposed to facilitate this and future updates.</jats:p>",0

The 2009 influenza pandemic originated from a swine-origin H1N1 virus, which, 
although less pathogenic than anticipated, may acquire additional 
virulence-associated mutations in the future. To estimate the potential risk, we 
sequentially passaged the isolate A/Hamburg/04/2009 in A549 human lung 
epithelial cells. After passage 6, we observed a 100-fold increased replication 
rate. High-throughput sequencing of viral gene segments identified five dominant 
mutations, whose contribution to the enhanced growth was analyzed by reverse 
genetics. The increased replication rate was pinpointed to two mutations within 
the hemagglutinin (HA) gene segment (HA1 D130E, HA2 I91L), near the receptor 
binding site and the stem domain. The adapted virus also replicated more 
efficiently in mice in vivo. Enhanced replication rate correlated with increased 
fusion pH of the HA protein and a decrease in receptor affinity. Our data might 
be relevant for surveillance of pre-pandemic strains and development of high 
titer cell culture strains for vaccine production.

"Genetic and molecular characterization of H9N2 and H5 avian influenza viruses from live poultry markets in Zhejiang Province, eastern China","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Live poultry markets (LPMs) are a key source of reassorted avian influenza viruses (AIVs) because of the density of terrestrial and aquatic poultry and the frequency of AIV infection. H9N2 viruses are prevalent in terrestrial poultry throughout Asia and have been isolated from poultry outbreaks worldwide. They infect both avian and mammalian species and may be significant donors of genetic material to emerging human pathogens. LPMs in Zhejiang Province were surveyed from 2013–2014 for AIVs. Three hundred seventy-four (374) AIV strains were isolated from 3,328 samples. Whole–genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed. We identified a novel H9N2 virus genotype that had undergone reassortment with gene segments from Qa/HK/G1/97–like, Ck/BJ/1/94–like and Dk/HK/Y439/97–like viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested the H9N2 viruses had undergone reassortments with other AIV subtypes. The results also suggested that two different clades (2.3.2 and 2.3.4.6) of H5 viruses were co–circulating in Zhejiang Province. Given that reassorted H5 AIVs were detected in geese and ducks, it is possible that apparently healthy birds contribute to emerging H5 AIVs. Continued surveillance is required in poultry in eastern China.</jats:p>",0

IFN-τ is specifically secreted by the conceptus in ruminants during early 
pregnancy, and it plays a vital role in the immunological function of pregnancy. 
However, its mechanism involving microRNA (miRNA) is still not well understood. 
Deep sequencing was used to explore the specific miRNA library of IFN-τ on 
bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEECs). The results showed that 574 known 
bovine miRNAs and 109 novel miRNAs were identified. We found 74 differentially 
expressed miRNAs, including 30 commonly expressed miRNAs in the experiment. 
Then, qPCR verification of six selected miRNAs showed that they corresponded 
with the sequencing data. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of predicted 
target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs, including influenza A, herpes 
simplex infection, antigen processing and presentation, viral myocarditis, TNF 
signaling pathway, graft-versus-host disease, and allograft rejection. These 
results may provide important contributions to the immune response during early 
pregnancy in ruminants, but further studies are need to verify the proposed 
cellular/immunological effects and role of specific miRNA as biomarkers in vivo.

5' and 3' UTR sequences on the coronavirus genome are known to carry cis-acting 
elements for DI RNA replication and presumably also virus genome replication. 5' 
UTR-adjacent coding sequences are also thought to harbor cis-acting elements. 
Here we have determined the 5' UTR and adjacent 289-nt sequences, and 3' UTR 
sequences, for six group 2 coronaviruses and have compared them to each other 
and to three previously reported group 2 members. Extensive regions of highly 
similar UTR sequences were found but small regions of divergence were also found 
indicating group 2 coronaviruses could be subdivided into those that are bovine 
coronavirus (BCoV)-like (BCoV, human respiratory coronavirus-OC43, human enteric 
coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, and equine 
coronavirus) and those that are murine hepatitis virus (MHV)-like (A59, 2, and 
JHM strains of MHV, puffinosis virus, and rat sialodacryoadenitis virus). The 3' 
UTRs of BCoV and MHV have been previously shown to be interchangeable. Here, a 
reporter-containing BCoV DI RNA was shown to be replicated by all five BCoV-like 
helper viruses and by MHV-H2 (a human cell-adapted MHV strain), a representative 
of the MHV-like subgroup, demonstrating group 2 common 5' and 3' replication 
signaling elements. BCoV DI RNA, furthermore, acquired the leader of HCoV-OC43 
by leader switching, demonstrating for the first time in vivo recombination 
between animal and human coronavirus molecules. These results indicate that 
common replication signaling elements exist among group 2 coronaviruses despite 
a two-cluster pattern within the group and imply there could exist a high 
potential for recombination among group members.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a causative agent of infectious hepatitis in animals 
and humans both in developing and developed countries. Here, we collected 500 
sheep sera and 75 raw sheep liver samples from a slaughterhouse in the southern 
part of the Xinjiang region, China, along with 26 sera of butchers from the same 
slaughterhouse. All serum samples were tested for anti-HEV antibody by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both serum and liver samples were evaluated 
for the presence of HEV RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting 
partial nucleotide sequences of open reading frame 2 (ORF2). The results 
indicate that sheep seroprevalence was 35.20 % (176/500) and that four of the 75 
(5.3 %) sheep livers showed detectable amounts of HEV RNA. The seroprevalence of 
the butchers was 57.7 % (15/26). The four amplicons shared 97.8-100 % nucleotide 
sequence identity and had pairwise sequence identities of 81.6-85.3 %, 84.2-85.3 
%, 82.1-85.3 % and 84.7-97.9 % with the corresponding regions of genotypes 1, 2, 
3 and 4 of HEV, respectively. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on 
alignments of an amplified 186-bp ORF2 sequence and corresponding reference 
strains. The analysis showed that the four sheep strains detected in our study 
formed a lineage within a genotype 4 cluster that contains hb-3, bjsw1, T1, 
swCH189 and swCH25, all of which belong to genotype 4, subtype 4d. The results 
indicated a high level of seroconversion in sheep and suggested that sheep liver 
may be a source of foodborne HEV infection in humans.

Seventy-nine Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) isolated from clinical specimens of 
different poultry species including chickens, pigeons (Columba livia), geese and 
ostriches in Eastern China during 2005-2008 were characterized biologically and 
phylogenetically. The results showed genetic diversity of these viruses: three 
class I viruses and one genotype I and 12 genotype II viruses of class II 
circulating in chickens were avirulent; four genotype VIb viruses isolated from 
pigeons were moderately virulent; and two genotype III viruses and 57 genotype 
VIId viruses were highly virulent. The three class I viruses were further 
classified as genotypes 2 and 3. The very high F protein sequence identity of 
one genotype I virus with strain Queensland V4 and 12 genotype II viruses with 
strain La Sota indicated that these viruses originated from the two vaccine 
strains. Two genotype III viruses shared greater than 99% sequence identity with 
the moderately virulent vaccine strain Mukteswar but exhibited significantly 
higher virulence, suggesting that they evolved from the vaccine virus and that 
the Mukteswar vaccine should be banned in China. Fifty-seven of the 63 virulent 
NDVs in this study belonged to genotype VIId, indicating its predominance in 
Eastern China. Genotype VIId viruses could be further classified into two 
subgroups. Four of the five NDVs isolated from pigeons belonged to genotype VIb, 
indicating its host-specific preference. Both the genotype VIb and VIId NDVs 
showed low amino acid similarity to the vaccine strains currently used in China, 
implying the urgent need to develop better vaccines against the most prevalent 
NDVs in China.

Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most devastating diseases to the poultry 
industry. The causative agents of ND are virulent strains of Newcastle disease 
virus (NDV), which are members of the genus Avulavirus within the family 
Paramyxoviridae. Waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, are generally considered 
potential reservoirs of NDV and may show few or no clinical signs when infected 
with viruses that are obviously virulent in chickens. However, ND outbreaks in 
domestic waterfowl have been frequently reported in many countries in the past 
decade. In this study, 18 NDV strains isolated from domestic ducks in southern 
and eastern China, between 2005 and 2013, were genetically and phylogenetically 
characterized. The complete genomes of these strains were sequenced, and they 
exhibited genome sizes of 15,186 nucleotides (nt), 15,192 nt, and 15,198 nt, 
which follow the ""rule of six"" that is required for the replication of NDV 
strains. Based on the cleavage site of the F protein and pathogenicity tests in 
chickens, 17 of our NDV isolates were categorized as lentogenic viruses, and one 
was characterized as a velogenic virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 
partial sequences of the F gene and the complete genome sequences showed that 
there are at least four genotypes of NDV circulating in domestic ducks; GD1, 
AH224, and AH209 belong to genotypes VIId, Ib, and II of class II NDVs, 
respectively, and the remaining 15 isolates belong to genotype 1b of class I 
NDVs. Cross-reactive hemagglutination inhibition tests demonstrated that the 
antigenic relatedness between NDV strains may be associated with their 
genotypes, rather than their hosts. These results suggest that though those NDV 
isolates were from duck, they still don't form a phylogenetic group because they 
came from the same species; however, they may play an important role in 
promoting the evolution of NDVs.

BACKGROUND: Duck enteritis virus (DEV) belongs to the family Herpesviridae and 
is an important epornitic agent that causes economic losses in the waterfowl 
industry. The Chinese virulent (CHv) and attenuate vaccines (VAC) are two 
different pathogenic DEV strains. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding 
RNAs that regulate gene expression in viral infection. Nonetheless, there is 
little information on virulent duck enteritis virus (DEV)-encoded miRNAs.
RESULTS: Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified 39 mature viral miRNAs 
from CHv-infected duck embryo fibroblasts cells. Compared with the reported 33 
VAC-encoded miRNAs, only 13 miRNA sequences and 22 ""seed sequences"" of miRNA 
were identical, and 8 novel viral miRNAs were detected and confirmed by 
stem-loop RT-qPCR in this study. Using RNAhybrid and PITA software, 38 
CHv-encoded miRNAs were predicted to target 41 viral genes and formed a complex 
regulatory network. Dual luciferase reporter assay (DLRA) confirmed that viral 
dev-miR-D8-3p can directly target the 3'-UTR of CHv US1 gene (p < 0.05). Gene 
Ontology analysis on host target genes of viral miRNAs were mainly involved in 
biological regulation, cellular and metabolic processes. In addition, 598 novel 
duck-encoded miRNAs were detected in this study. Thirty-eight host miRNAs showed 
significant differential expression after CHv infection: 13 miRNAs were 
up-regulated, and 25 miRNAs were down-regulated, which may affect viral 
replication in the host cell.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that CHv encoded a different set of microRNAs 
and formed a unique regulatory network compared with VAC. This is the first 
report of DEF miRNAs expression profile and an analysis of these miRNAs 
regulatory mechanisms during DEV infection. These data provide a basis for 
further exploring miRNA regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of DEV infection 
and contribute to the understanding of the CHv-host interaction at the miRNA 
level.

Re-emergence of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) was officially reported in 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in north-western China in November 2013, and 
then along with the movements of goats and sheep, this disease rapidly spread to 
other provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities (P/A/M) of China. A total 
of 256 PPR-affected counties in 22 P/A/M were identified up to September 2014. 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the current circulating strains and Tibet 
strains isolated previously in 2007, both belonged to lineage IV but in 
different sub-branches. Nevertheless, compared with the Tibet strains, the 
current circulating strains shared high degree of genetic homology with those 
from Pakistan and Tajikistan.

A Novel Capillary Electrophoresis-Based High-Throughput Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction System for the Simultaneous Detection of Nine Pathogens in Swine,"<jats:p>Here we aimed to develop a capillary electrophoresis-based high-throughput multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system for the simultaneous detection of nine pathogens in swine. Nine pairs of specific primers and a set of universal primers were designed; the multiplex PCR was established. The specificity and cross-reactivity of this assay were examined, and the detection limit was determined using serial 10-fold dilutions of plasmids containing the target sequences. The assay was further tested using 144 clinical samples. We found that the nine specific amplification peaks were observed, and the assay had a high degree of specificity, without nonspecific amplification. The simultaneous detection limit for the nine viruses reached 10000 copies <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> when all of the premixed viral targets were present. Seventy-seven of the clinical samples tested positive for at least one of the viruses; the principal viral infections in the clinical samples were porcine circovirus type 2 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. This approach has much potential for further development of high-throughput detection tools for the diagnosis of diseases in animals.</jats:p>",0

OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular characteristics of H9N2-subtype avian 
influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated from air samples collected in live poultry 
markets (LPMs) and explore their sequence identities with AIVs that caused human 
infection.
METHODS: Weekly surveillance of H9N2-subtype AIVs in the air of LPMs was 
conducted from 2015 to 2016. H9-positive samples were isolated from chicken 
embryos. Whole genome sequences of the isolated AIVs were obtained through 
high-throughput sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis and key loci variations of the 
sequences were further analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 327 aerosol samples were collected from LPMs. Nine samples 
were positive for H9-subtype AIVs based on quantitative real-time reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR). According to the whole 
genome sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis, except for the 
A/Environment/Zhongshan/ZS201505/2015 (ZS201505) strain, 8 gene segments of 8 
aerosol H9N2 isolates and 2 H9N2 human isolates in 2015 were located in the same 
clade. Among key loci variations, except for the ZS201505 strain, H9N2-subtype 
AIVs had no mutations in eight receptor binding sites of hemagglutinin (HA), and 
stalks of neuraminidase (NA) proteins exhibited a deletion site of three bases. 
The PA gene of ZS201503 and ZS201602 exhibited an L336M mutation. The N30D and 
T215A mutations in the M1 gene and amino acid residues L89V in PB2, P42S in NS1 
and S31N in M2 were retained in these 9 strains of H9N2 isolates, which could 
enhance the virus's virulence.
CONCLUSION: Live H9N2 AIVs survived in the aerosol of LPMs in Zhongshan City. 
The aerosol viruses had a close evolutionary relationship with human epidemic 
strains, indicating that there might be a risk of AIV transmission from polluted 
aerosols in LPMs to humans. Mutations in H9N2-subtype AIVs isolated from air 
samples collected from LPMs suggested their pathogenicity was enhanced to infect 
humans.

Bats and rodents are widely distributed worldwide and can be native or 
intermediate reservoirs of many important zoonotic viruses. Pestiviruses are a 
group of virus species of the genus Pestivirus under the family Flaviviridae 
that can infect a wide variety of artiodactylous hosts, including swine and 
ruminants. Two classic types of pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus and 
classical swine fever virus, are important causative agents of mild-to-severe 
disease in bovine and swine hosts, respectively, and cause tremendous economic 
losses in these industries. Recent reports revealed that bats and rodents could 
also act as natural hosts of pestiviruses and an atypical porcine pestivirus, 
which cause disease in piglets, showed a close genetic relationship with a 
specific bat pestivirus, RaPestV-1. This study aimed to describe the detection 
and characterization of novel pestiviruses from bats and rodents in different 
locations by analyzing the available bat and rodent virome data from throughout 
China. Two bat pestivirus species and four rodent pestivirus species that are 
distinct from other known viruses were identified and sequenced. These viruses 
were identified from two bat species and four rodent species in different 
Chinese provinces. There were two distinct lineages present in these viruses, 
that differ from artiodactylous pestivirus. These findings expand our 
understanding of the genetic diversity of pestiviruses in bats and rodents and 
suggest the presence of a diverse set of pestiviruses in non-artiodactylous 
hosts. This study may provide new insight for the prevention of future viral 
disease outbreaks originating from bats and rodents.

Deciphering the bat virome catalog to better understand the ecological diversity of bat viruses and the bat origin of emerging infectious diseases,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Studies have demonstrated that ~60%–80% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans originated from wild life. Bats are natural reservoirs of a large variety of viruses, including many important zoonotic viruses that cause severe diseases in humans and domestic animals. However, the understanding of the viral population and the ecological diversity residing in bat populations is unclear, which complicates the determination of the origins of certain EIDs. Here, using bats as a typical wildlife reservoir model, virome analysis was conducted based on pharyngeal and anal swab samples of 4440 bat individuals of 40 major bat species throughout China. The purpose of this study was to survey the ecological and biological diversities of viruses residing in these bat species, to investigate the presence of potential bat-borne zoonotic viruses and to evaluate the impacts of these viruses on public health. The data obtained in this study revealed an overview of the viral community present in these bat samples. Many novel bat viruses were reported for the first time and some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. This genetic evidence provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolution pattern of certain viruses, such as coronaviruses and noroviruses. These data offer meaningful ecological information for predicting and tracing wildlife-originated EIDs.</jats:p>",0
Virome Analysis for Identification of Novel Mammalian Viruses in Bat Species from Chinese Provinces,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bats are natural hosts for a large variety of zoonotic viruses. This study aimed to describe the range of bat viromes, including viruses from mammals, insects, fungi, plants, and phages, in 11 insectivorous bat species (216 bats in total) common in six provinces of China. To analyze viromes, we used sequence-independent PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing technology (Solexa Genome Analyzer II; Illumina). The viromes were identified by sequence similarity comparisons to known viruses. The mammalian viruses included those of the

In addition to the viruses and phages associated with the insects, plants, and bacterial flora related to the diet and habitation of bats, we identified the complete or partial genome sequences of 13 novel mammalian viruses. These included herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, a circovirus, a bocavirus, picornaviruses, a pestivirus, and a foamy virus. Pairwise alignments and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these novel viruses showed little genetic similarity with previously reported viruses. This study also revealed a high prevalence and diversity of bat astroviruses and coronaviruses in some provinces. These findings have expanded our understanding of the viromes of bats in China and hinted at the presence of a large variety of unknown mammalian viruses in many common bat species of mainland China.

Non-suppurative encephalitis is one of the most frequent pathological diagnosis 
in cattle with neurological disease, but there is a gap in the knowledge on 
disease-associated pathogens. In order to identify viruses that are associated 
with non-suppurative encephalitis in cattle, we used a viral metagenomics 
approach on a sample set of 16 neurologically-diseased cows. We detected six 
virus candidates: parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV-5), bovine astrovirus CH13/NeuroS1 
(BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1), bovine polyomavirus 2 (BPyV-2 SF), ovine herpesvirus 2 
(OvHV-2), bovine herpesvirus 6 (BHV-6) and a novel bovine betaretrovirus termed 
BoRV-CH15. In a case-control study using PCR, BoAstV-CH13 (p=0.046), BoPV-2 SF 
(p=0.005) and BoHV-6 (p=4.3E-05) were statistically associated with the disease. 
These data expand our knowledge on encephalitis-associated pathogens in cattle 
and point to the value of NGS in resolving complex infection scenarios in a 
clinical disease setting.

Enhanced virome sequencing using targeted sequence capture,"<jats:p>Metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) is an important tool for characterizing viral populations. It is culture independent, requires no a priori knowledge of the viruses in the sample, and may provide useful genomic information. However, MSS can lack sensitivity and may yield insufficient data for detailed analysis. We have created a targeted sequence capture panel, ViroCap, designed to enrich nucleic acid from DNA and RNA viruses from 34 families that infect vertebrate hosts. A computational approach condensed ∼1 billion bp of viral reference sequence into &lt;200 million bp of unique, representative sequence suitable for targeted sequence capture. We compared the effectiveness of detecting viruses in standard MSS versus MSS following targeted sequence capture. First, we analyzed two sets of samples, one derived from samples submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory and one derived from samples collected in a study of fever in children. We detected 14 and 18 viruses in the two sets, comprising 19 genera from 10 families, with dramatic enhancement of genome representation following capture enrichment. The median fold-increases in percentage viral reads post-capture were 674 and 296. Median breadth of coverage increased from 2.1% to 83.2% post-capture in the first set and from 2.0% to 75.6% in the second set. Next, we analyzed samples containing a set of diverse anellovirus sequences and demonstrated that ViroCap could be used to detect viral sequences with up to 58% variation from the references used to select capture probes. ViroCap substantially enhances MSS for a comprehensive set of viruses and has utility for research and clinical applications.</jats:p>",0
Comparative Transcriptomics Highlights the Role of the Activator Protein 1 Transcription Factor in the Host Response to Ebolavirus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>

            comprise two genera of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Despite considerable research efforts, the molecular events following Ebola virus (EBOV) infection are poorly understood. With the view of identifying host factors that underpin EBOV pathogenesis, we compared the transcriptomes of EBOV-infected human, pig, and bat kidney cells using a transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. Despite a significant difference in viral transcription/replication between the cell lines, all cells responded to EBOV infection through a robust induction of extracellular growth factors. Furthermore, a significant upregulation of activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor complex members
            <jats:italic>FOS</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>JUN</jats:italic>
            was observed in permissive cell lines. Functional studies focusing on human cells showed that EBOV infection induces protein expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear accumulation of JUN and, to a lesser degree, FOS. Using a luciferase-based reporter, we show that EBOV infection induces AP1 transactivation activity within human cells at 48 and 72 h postinfection. Finally, we show that JUN knockdown decreases the expression of EBOV-induced host gene expression. Taken together, our study highlights the role of AP1 in promoting the host gene expression profile that defines EBOV pathogenesis.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Many questions remain about the molecular events that underpin filovirus pathophysiology. The rational design of new intervention strategies, such as postexposure therapeutics, will be significantly enhanced through an in-depth understanding of these molecular events. We believe that new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EBOV may be possible by examining the transcriptomic response of taxonomically diverse cell lines (derived from human, pig, and bat). We first identified the responsive pathways using an RNA-seq-based transcriptomics approach. Further functional and computational analysis focusing on human cells highlighted an important role for the AP1 transcription factor in mediating the transcriptional response to EBOV infection. Our study sheds new light on how host transcription factors respond to and promote the transcriptional landscape that follows viral infection.

Genetic typing of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is important for precise 
classification of viruses. Traditionally, inferring BVDV phylogeny has been 
performed by distance-based method, i.e. neighbor-joining for single genes. In 
this study, a Bayesian approach was exploited to analyze five genetic regions of 
BVDV genome (5' UTR, N(pro), E2a, E2b, and NS3) for 68 taxa retrieved from 
GenBank. The results showed that all taxa in the consensus tree of E2a have been 
assigned correctly to corresponding groups, i.e. type-2 BVDV, and BVDV-1a, -1b, 
-1c, -1e, and -1g, supported by a high posterior probability. In contrast, 
subgroup 1a formed polytomies in the consensus trees of 5' UTR and NS3. 
Polytomies also appeared among the subgroup 1b in the consensus trees of N(pro) 
and E2b. Analysis of a combined dataset produced an unambiguous, well-supported 
phylogenetic hypothesis. The topologies found for each genetic region separately 
and combined were different, but the differences were mainly weakly supported by 
the data. Combining the data allowed the identification of well-supported clades 
of strains that correspond to some of the previously defined subgroups. Only a 
combined approach will allow the confident placement of new strains in the 
current classification of viruses into genotype and subgenotype.

Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an infectious disease caused by peste des 
petits ruminants virus (PPRV). While PPR mainly affects domestic goats and 
sheep, it also affects wild ungulates such as ibex, blue sheep, and gazelle, 
although there are few reports regarding PPRV infection in wild animals. Between 
January 2015 and February 2015, it was found for the first time that wild ibexes 
died from PPRV infection in Bazhou, Xinjiang, China, where a total of 38 ibexes 
(including young and adult ibexes) were found to have died abnormally from 
PPR-related issues. First, we tested for the presence of the F gene of PPRV by 
RT-PCR. Then, we compared the sequence of the isolated F gene from the ibex 
strain, termed PPRV Xinjiang/Ibex/2015, with those previously identified from 
small domestic ruminants from local areas near where the reported isolate was 
collected as well as those from other regions. The current sequence was 
phylogenetically classified as a lineage IV virus, and shared a high level of 
sequence identity (99.7%) with a previously described Xinjiang PPRV isolate.

Despite intensive vaccination programs in many countries, including China, 
Newcastle disease has been reported sporadically and is still a significant 
threat to the poultry industry in China. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is 
infectious for at least 250 bird species, but the role of wild birds in virus 
epidemiology remains largely unknown. Fourteen NDV isolates were obtained from 
2040 samples collected from wild birds or the environment in Guangdong province, 
southern China, from 2013 to 2015. The isolation rate was the highest in the 
period of wintering and lowest during the periods of spring migration, nesting, 
and postnesting. A maximum clade credibility phylogenetic analysis revealed that 
at least four genotypes circulate in southern China: three class II genotypes 
(II, VI, and IX) and one class I (1b). We also demonstrated that most isolates 
from wild birds were highly similar to isolates from poultry, and two isolates 
were linked to viruses from wild birds in northern China. These data suggested 
that wild birds could disseminate NDV and poultry-derived viruses may spillover 
to wild birds. Accordingly, vaccine development and poultry management 
strategies should be considered to prevent future NDV outbreaks, particularly 
given the strength of the poultry industry in developing countries, such as 
China.

A novel porcine parvovirus designated as porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2) was 
initially identified in Myanmar in 2001, in China during 2006-2007, and in 
Hungary in 2012. To investigate the presence and prevalence of PPV2 in the USA, 
a novel TaqMan(®) real-time PCR method was developed and used for a PPV2 survey 
using 483 lung samples, 185 fecal samples and 122 sera collected from pigs on 
295 farms in 18 U.S. states. The overall prevalence of PPV2 was 20.7% (100/483) 
in lung samples and 7.6% (14/185) in fecal samples obtained from pigs of 
different age groups, and 1.6% (2/122) in sera or thoracic fluids obtained from 
neonatal pigs. Further genomic sequence comparison demonstrated that the 2011 
U.S. PPV2 sequences have nucleotide identities of 95.4-97.7% with the 2006-2007 
strains detected in China while the nucleotide identity was 94.7% with the 2001 
strain detected in Myanmar, indicating persistent evolution of the virus. 
Phylogenetic and sequence homology analyses demonstrated a close relationship of 
PPV2 with members of the proposed genus PARV4-like virus, and the classification 
of PPV2 into this proposed genus is suggested.

Parvoviruses infect a wide variety of vertebrates and arthropods and are 
associated with various clinical manifestations. Due to the advent of new 
sequence-independent PCR methods and high-throughput sequencing, several novel 
members of parvoviruses within the subfamily Parvovirinae were recently 
described. Several of these viruses do not fit in the current classification and 
others now have confusing or contradictory nomenclature because two or more 
names were used for similar or identical groups of parvoviruses or identical 
names were used for distinct virus groups. In this study, recently described 
vertebrate parvoviruses with emphasis on those identified in pigs were 
classified through phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of their 
complete or near complete genomes, open reading frame (ORF) 1 (non-structural 
protein, NS1), ORF2 (capsid protein, VP1), and ORF3 (nuclear phosphoprotein, 
NP1) genes by using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Maximum Likelihood 
(ML) and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) methods. Among all available vertebrate 
parvovirus sequences, eight distinct clades were identified, corresponding to 
the five well established genera Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Denpendovirus, 
Amdovirus and Bocavirus. Moreover, three novel clades were identified and 
tentatively designated as PARV4-like virus, novel clade 1 and novel clade 2. 
Parvoviruses in pigs were found to be distributed across four different clades 
including Parvovirus, Bocavirus, PARV4-like virus and the novel clade 2. All pig 
parvoviruses identified to date were organized based on the current analysis. 
The present analysis will assist to clarify the nomenclature of parvoviruses in 
pigs and facilitate future uniform assignment of names for new parvoviruses 
within the subfamily Parvovirinae.

Identification and Classification of Endogenous Retroviruses in Cattle,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            The aim of this study was to identify the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences in a bovine genome. We subjected bovine genomic DNA to PCR with degenerate or ovine ERV (OERV) family-specific primers that aimed to amplify the retroviral
            <jats:italic>pro/pol</jats:italic>
            region. Sequence analysis of 113 clones obtained by PCR revealed that 69 were of retroviral origin. On the basis of the OERV classification system, these clones from degenerate PCR could be divided into the β3, γ4, and γ9 families. PCR with OERV family-specific primers revealed an additional ERV that was classified into the bovine endogenous retrovirus (BERV) γ7 family. In conclusion, here we report the results of a genome scale study of the BERV. Our study shows that the ERV family expansion in cattle may be somewhat limited, while more diverse family members of ERVs have been reported from other artiodactyls, such as pigs and sheep.

Understanding PRRSV Infection in Porcine Lung Based on Genome-Wide Transcriptome Response Identified by Deep Sequencing,"1. PLoS One. 2010 Jun 29;5(6):e11377. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0011377.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has been one of the most 
economically important diseases affecting swine industry worldwide and causes 
great economic losses each year. PRRS virus (PRRSV) replicates mainly in porcine 
alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) and develops persistent 
infections, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), interstitial pneumonia and 
immunosuppression. But the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection still are 
poorly understood. Here we report on the first genome-wide host transcriptional 
responses to classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a 
infection using Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) system, a 
tag-based high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method, and analyse 
systematically the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after 
N-PRRSV infection and infection pathology. Our results suggest that N-PRRSV 
appeared to utilize multiple strategies for its replication and spread in 
infected pigs, including subverting host innate immune response, inducing an 
anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory state as well as developing ADE. 
Upregulation expression of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, 
adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes and inflammatory cells, antibodies, 
complement activation were likely to result in the development of inflammatory 
responses during N-PRRSV infection processes. N-PRRSV-induced immunosuppression 
might be mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which caused depletion of 
immune cells and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they 
were unable to eradicate the primary infection. Our systems analysis will 
benefit for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of N-PRRSV 
infection, developing novel antiviral therapies and identifying genetic 
components for swine resistance/susceptibility to PRRS.

Aberrant host immune response induced by highly virulent PRRSV identified by digital gene expression tag profiling,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>There was a large scale outbreak of the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in China and Vietnam during 2006 and 2007 that resulted in unusually high morbidity and mortality among pigs of all ages. The mechanisms underlying the molecular pathogenesis of the highly virulent PRRS virus (H-PRRSV) remains unknown. Therefore, the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after H-PRRSV infection and infection pathology were analyzed in this study using high-throughput deep sequencing and histopathology.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>H-PRRSV infection resulted in severe lung pathology. The results indicate that aberrant host innate immune responses to H-PRRSV and induction of an anti-apoptotic state could be responsible for the aggressive replication and dissemination of H-PRRSV. Prolific rapid replication of H-PRRSV could have triggered aberrant sustained expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines leading to a markedly robust inflammatory response compounded by significant cell death and increased oxidative damage. The end result was severe tissue damage and high pathogenicity.</jats:p>

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can cause severe disease in chickens. Although NDV 
vaccines exist, there are frequent reports of outbreaks in vaccinated chickens. 
During 2009-2010, despite intense vaccination, NDV caused major outbreaks among 
commercial poultry farms in Indonesia. These outbreaks raised concern regarding 
the protective immunity of current vaccines against circulating virulent strains 
in Indonesia. In this study, we investigated whether a recombinant attenuated 
Indonesian NDV strain could provide better protection against prevalent 
Indonesian viruses. A reverse genetics system for the highly virulent NDV strain 
Banjarmasin/010/10 (Ban/010) isolated in Indonesia in 2010 was constructed. The 
Ban/010 virus is classified in genotype VII of class II NDV, which is 
genetically distinct from the commercial vaccine strains B1 and LaSota, which 
belong to genotype II, and shares only 89 and 87% amino acid identity for the 
protective antigens F and HN, respectively. A mutant virus, named Ban/AF, was 
developed in which the virulent F protein cleavage site motif ""RRQKR↓F"" was 
modified to an avirulent motif ""GRQGR↓L"" by three amino acid substitutions 
(underlined). The Ban/AF vaccine virus did not produce syncytia or plaques in 
cell culture, even in the presence of added protease. Pathogenicity tests showed 
that Ban/AF was completely avirulent. Ban/AF replicated efficiently during 10 
consecutive passages in chickens and remained genetically stable. Serological 
analysis showed that Ban/AF induced higher neutralization and hemagglutination 
inhibition antibody titers against the prevalent viruses than the commercial 
vaccines B1 or LaSota. Both Ban/AF and commercial vaccines provided protection 
against clinical disease and mortality after challenge with virulent NDV strain 
Ban/010 (genotype VII) or GB Texas (genotype II). However, Ban/AF significantly 
reduced challenge virus shedding from the vaccinated birds compared to B1 
vaccine. These results suggest that Ban/AF can provide better protection than 
commercial vaccines and is a promising vaccine candidate against NDV strains 
circulating in Indonesia.

Porcine parvovirus (PPV) are small, non-enveloped and single-stranded DNA 
viruses, taxonomically classifiable within the family Parvoviridae. Seven PPV 
genotypes (PPV1 to PPV7) have been identified to date. PPV7, the most recently 
discovered PPV genotype, was first reported in US pigs in 2016. To explore PPV7 
status in Chinese pig populations a total of 64 serum samples collected from two 
commercial farms in Guangdong province in 2014 were analyzed. PPV7 DNA was 
detected in 32.8% (21/64) of tested samples. On the porcine circovirus type 2 
(PCV2) positive farm, the prevalence rate of PPV7 was 65.5% (19/29) which was 
significantly higher than that on the PCV2 negative farm (2/35, 5.7%), 
indicating a possible association between PCV2 and PPV7 infections. The 
sequences of three PPV7 strains were determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
that the identified PPV7 strains circulating in China shared 98.7%-99.7% 
nucleotide homology with the US strain. Further sequence comparison analysis 
indicated that GD-2014-2 and GD-2014-3 possess a consecutive 9-nt deletion in 
the VP gene. This is the first report of the existence of PPV7 in China and this 
finding will strengthen understanding of the epidemiology of porcine parvovirus 
in Chinese pigs.

Porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) varies between pig breeds. Screening and 
analysis of PERV in putative pig breeds may provide basic parameters to evaluate 
the biological safety of xenotransplantation from pigs to humans. In this study, 
PERV was investigated among the conservation population of the Ningxiang pig. 
The result revealed that the genotype of PERV distribution was subtype A, 100%; 
subtype B, 100%; and subtype C, 100%. The env sequences of PERV-A and -B showed 
11 clones detected by KpnI and MboI digestion, indicating that there existed 
multiple variants of PERV-A and -B in the Ningxiang pig. Reverse transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction results showed that PERV had transcriptional activity 
in these individuals. In addition, PERV A/C recombinant was detected in most 
individuals of Ningxiang pig. Because PERV A/C recombinants increase the 
potential infectious risk, the breed may not be a proper donor for 
xenotransplantation.

Bocaparvovirus infections of humans and both wild and domestic animals have been 
widely reported around the world. In this study, we detected and genetically 
characterized porcine bocavirus (PBoV) carried by murine rodents (Rattus 
norvegicus, Rattus tanezumi, and Rattus losea) and house shrews (Suncus murinus) 
in China. Between May 2015 and May 2017, 496 murine rodents and 23 house shrews 
were captured in four Chinese provinces. Nested polymerase chain reaction was 
used to investigate the prevalence of PBoV in throat swab, faecal and serum 
samples. A total of 7.5% (39/519) throat swab samples, 60.5% (309/511) faecal 
samples, and 22.9% (52/227) serum samples were PBoV-positive. The prevalence 
among R. norvegicus and R. tanezumi was higher than that among R. losea and 
house shrews. PBoV-positive samples were found in all four provinces. 
Phylogenetic analysis based on partial viral capsid protein 1/2 (VP1/VP2) showed 
that sequences obtained in this study formed a novel group (PBoV G4). In 
addition, five near full-length PBoV genomes (4,715-4,798 nt) were acquired. 
These genomes encoded two non-structural proteins, NS1 (1,908 nt in four genomes 
and 1,923 nt in the remaining genome) and NP1 (600 nt), and the structural 
proteins, VP1/VP2 (1,851 nt). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PBoV G4 is 
distinct from rodent, human, and other bocaviruses. In conclusion, PBoV G4 
prevalence was high among two common murine rodents in China, and the 
pathogenecity of PBoV G4 need to be further clarified.

BACKGROUND: The animal gastrointestinal tract contains a complex community of 
microbes, whose composition ultimately reflects the co-evolution of 
microorganisms with their animal host and the diet adopted by the host. Although 
the importance of gut microbiota of humans has been well demonstrated, there is 
a paucity of research regarding non-human primates (NHPs), especially 
herbivorous NHPs.
RESULTS: In this study, an analysis of 97,942 pyrosequencing reads generated 
from Rhinopithecus bieti fecal DNA extracts was performed to help better 
understanding of the microbial diversity and functional capacity of the R. bieti 
gut microbiome. The taxonomic analysis of the metagenomic reads indicated that 
R. bieti fecal microbiomes were dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, 
Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla. The comparative analysis of taxonomic 
classification revealed that the metagenome of R. bieti was characterized by an 
overrepresentation of bacteria of phylum Fibrobacteres and Spirochaetes as 
compared with other animals. Primary functional categories were associated 
mainly with protein, carbohydrates, amino acids, DNA and RNA metabolism, 
cofactors, cell wall and capsule and membrane transport. Comparing glycoside 
hydrolase profiles of R. bieti with those of other animal revealed that the R. 
bieti microbiome was most closely related to cow rumen.
CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic and functional analysis demonstrated that R. bieti 
possesses a broad diversity of bacteria and numerous glycoside hydrolases 
responsible for lignocellulosic biomass degradation which might reflect the 
adaptations associated with a diet rich in fibrous matter. These results would 
contribute to the limited body of NHPs metagenome studies and provide a unique 
genetic resource of plant cell wall degrading microbial enzymes. However, future 
studies on the metagenome sequencing of R. bieti regarding the effects of age, 
genetics, diet and environment on the composition and activity of the 
metagenomes are required.

Hybrid DNA virus in Chinese patients with seronegative hepatitis discovered by deep sequencing,"<jats:p>
            Seronegative hepatitis—non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis—is poorly characterized but strongly associated with serious complications. We collected 92 sera specimens from patients with non-A–E hepatitis in Chongqing, China between 1999 and 2007. Ten sera pools were screened by Solexa deep sequencing. We discovered a 3,780-bp contig present in all 10 pools that yielded BLASTx E scores of 7e-05–0.008 against parvoviruses. The complete sequence of the

            -assembled 3,780-bp contig was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions over almost the entire genome, and the virus was provisionally designated NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of two major ORFs. By protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the replication-associated protein of bat circovirus and the capsid protein of porcine parvovirus, respectively.

            and
            <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>
            . Prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. Sixty-three of 90 patient samples (70%) were positive, but all those from 45 healthy controls were negative. Average virus titer in the patient specimens was 1.05 e4 copies/µL. Specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were sought by immunoblotting. Eighty-four percent of patients were positive for IgG, and 31% were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78% of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although more work is needed to determine the etiologic role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data indicate that a parvovirus-like virus is highly prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-A–E hepatitis.

            In addition to causing illness, viruses leave indelible footprints behind, because infection permanently alters the immune system. Blood tests that detect antiviral antibodies can provide information about both past and present viral exposures. Typically, such tests measure only one virus at a time. Using a synthetic representation of all human viral peptides, Xu

            developed a blood test that identifies antibodies against all known human viruses. They studied blood samples from nearly 600 people of differing ages and geographic locations and found that most had been exposed to about 10 viral species over their lifetime. Despite differences in the rates of exposure to specific viruses, the antibody responses in most individuals targeted the same viral epitopes.

Transcriptome Analysis of HepG2 Cells Expressing ORF3 from Swine Hepatitis E Virus to Determine the Effects of ORF3 on Host Cells,"<jats:p>Hepatitis E virus- (HEV-) mediated hepatitis has become a global public health problem. An important regulatory protein of HEV, ORF3, influences multiple signal pathways in host cells. In this study, to investigate the function of ORF3 from the swine form of HEV (SHEV), high-throughput RNA-Seq-based screening was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes in ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells. The results were validated with quantitative real-time PCR and gene ontology was employed to assign differentially expressed genes to functional categories. The results indicated that, in the established ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells, the mRNA levels of CLDN6, YLPM1, APOC3, NLRP1, SCARA3, FGA, FGG, FGB, and FREM1 were upregulated, whereas the mRNA levels of SLC2A3, DKK1, BPIFB2, and PTGR1 were downregulated. The deregulated expression of CLDN6 and FREM1 might contribute to changes in integral membrane protein and basement membrane protein expression, expression changes for NLRP1 might affect the apoptosis of HepG2 cells, and the altered expression of APOC3, SCARA3, and DKK1 may affect lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, ORF3 plays a functional role in virus-cell interactions by affecting the expression of integral membrane protein and basement membrane proteins and by altering the process of apoptosis and lipid metabolism in host cells. These findings provide important insight into the pathogenic mechanism of HEV.</jats:p>",0

Influenza A viruses of subtype H1N1 have been reported widely in pigs in China, 
associated with clinical disease. These mainly include classical swine H1N1, 
avian-like H1N1, and human-like H1N1 viruses. In this study, we reported a novel 
triple-reassortant H1N1 virus (A/swine/Guangdong/1/2010) containing genes from 
the classical swine (NP, NS), human (PB1) and avian (HA, NA, M, PB2, PA) 
lineages, which was for the first time reported in China. Also, phylogenetic 
analysis further confirmed that five genes segments (NS, NP, PB2, PB1, PA) of 
the isolate were closely related to the novel reassortant H1N2 viruses isolated 
in China in 2006, while the other three (HA, NA, M) were closely related to 
avian-like H1N1 viruses in China. The isolation of triple-reassortant H1N1 
influenza virus provides further evidence that pigs serve as emergence hosts or 
""mixing vessels"", and swine influenza virus (SIV) surveillance in China should 
be given a high priority.

The objective of this study was to characterize the infectious bursal disease 
viruses (IBDVs) circulating in broiler chicken farms in China between 2012 and 
2013. The VP2 gene sequences of nine newly isolated IBDVs, obtained using 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, were determined and compared 
with worldwide reference isolates, which have been previously well 
characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nine broiler IBDV 
isolates are closely related to very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) strains. Analysis of 
the predicted amino acid sequences of VP2 from the nine vvIBDVs isolated from 
the broilers revealed that they share 99.2 to 100% sequence similarity. 
Additionally, amino acids A222, I242, I256, I294 and S299 of VP2 that are 
conserved among previously characterized vvIBDV strains are also encoded by the 
nine isolates. This study confirms the circulation of vvIBDVs in Chinese broiler 
chicken farms experienced slow evolution and was relatively stable in China.

"Epidemiological and Evolutionary Inference of the Transmission Network of the 2014 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N2 Outbreak in British Columbia, Canada","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The first North American outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) involving a virus of Eurasian A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1) lineage began in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada in late November 2014. A total of 11 commercial and 1 non-commercial (backyard) operations were infected before the outbreak was terminated. Control measures included movement restrictions that were placed on a total of 404 individual premises, 150 of which were located within a 3 km radius of an infected premise(s) (IP). A complete epidemiological investigation revealed that the source of this HPAI H5N2 virus for 4 of the commercial IPs and the single non-commercial IP likely involved indirect contact with wild birds. Three IPs were associated with the movement of birds or service providers and localized/environmental spread was suspected as the source of infection for the remaining 4 IPs. Viral phylogenies, as determined by Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood methods, were used to validate the epidemiologically inferred transmission network. The phylogenetic clustering of concatenated viral genomes and the median-joining phylogenetic network of the viruses supported, for the most part, the transmission network that was inferred by the epidemiologic analysis.</jats:p>",0

Enterovirus 96 (EV-96) is a recently described member of the species Enterovirus 
C and is associated with paralysis and myelitis. In this study, using 
metagenomic sequencing, we identified a new enterovirus 96 strain 
(EV-96-SZ/GD/CHN/2014) as the sole pathogen causing hand, foot, and mouth 
disease (HFMD). A genomic comparison showed that EV-96-SZ/GD/CHN/2014 is most 
similar to the EV-96-05517 strain (85% identity), which has also been detected 
in Guangdong Province. This is the first time that metagenomic sequencing has 
been used to identify an EV-96 strain shown to be associated with HFMD.

H9N2 is one of the major subtypes of influenza virus circulating in poultry in 
China, which has a wide host range from bird to mammals. Two H9N2 viruses were 
isolated from one mink farm in 2014. Phylogenetic analysis showed that internal 
genes of the H9N2 viruses have close relationship with those of H7N9 viruses. 
Interestingly, two H9N2 were separated in phylogenetic trees, indicating that 
they are introduced to this mink farm in two independent events. And further 
mice studies showed that one H9N2 caused obvious weight loss and 20% mortality 
in infected mice, while another virus did not cause any clinical sign in mice 
infected at the same dose. Genetic analysis indicated that the virulent H9N2 
contain a natural mutation at 701N in PB2 protein, which was reported to 
contribute to mammalian adaptation. However, such substitution is absent in the 
H9N2 avirulent to mice. Circulation of H9N2 in mink may drive the virus to adapt 
mammals; continual surveillance of influenza virus in mink was warranted.

Subtype H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) circulating in China have aroused 
increasing concerns for their impact on poultry and risk to public health. The 
present study was an attempt to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship of H9N2 
AIVs in two geographically distinct regions of China where vaccination is 
routinely practiced. A total of 18 emerging H9N2 isolates were identified and 
genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) and 
neuraminidase (NA) genes confirmed that the isolates belonged to the Y280 
lineage. Based on the HA genes, the isolates were subdivided into two subgroups. 
The viruses from Zhejiang Province were clustered together in Group I, while the 
isolates from Guangdong Province were clustered together in Group II. Antigenic 
characterization showed that the tested viruses were antigenically different 
when compared to the current used vaccine strain. It was notable that 14 out of 
total 18 isolates had an amino acid exchange (Q→L) at position 216 (226 by H3 
Numbering) in the receptor-binding site, which indicated that the virus had 
potential affinity of binding to human like receptor. These results suggest that 
the emerging viruses have potential risk to public health than previously 
thought. Therefore, continuous surveillance studies of H9N2 influenza virus are 
very important to the prognosis and control of future influenza pandemics.

Thirty-one isolates of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) isolated within the 
past 15 years from imported cattle by the Japanese Animal Quarantine Service 
(AQS) were used in this study in which a 5'-untranslated region of each isolate 
was genetically analyzed. Twenty-six of the 31 isolates were classified as BVDV1 
and the remainder as BVDV2. Phylogenetic analysis of the RT-PCR fragments 
amplified from the isolates showed the presence of viruses belonging to the 
BVDV1a, BVDV1b, BVDV1c, unclassified BVDV1 genotypes, and BVDV2. From the cattle 
of Australian origin, 16 of 17 isolates were classified as BVDV1c. This result 
was in agreement with a report showing that BVDV1c was a predominant subgenotype 
in Australia. From the cattle of North American origin, BVDV1 and BVDV2 species 
were both found. BVDV2 from the North American cattle was identified as the same 
cluster as the BVDV 890 strain, which is the prototype of BVDV2. These results 
suggest that the BVDVs isolated from exported cattle at the AQS reflect the 
predominant genotypes of BVDVs found in the exporting countries. The 
unclassified BVDV1 genotype of Chinese origin was in the same cluster as the 
ZM-95 strain, which was isolated from pigs in China. In this study, the genomic 
properties of 31 isolates of BVDV collected in the AQS were investigated. We 
concluded that isolates are genetically heterogeneous but geographically 
restricted. The information obtained from this report will be useful when 
carrying out epidemiological surveys of BVDV isolated in Japan.

Recent studies indicate that hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection occurs not only 
in developing countries but also in industrialized nations. However, the 
characteristics of domestic infections of hepatitis E in Japan are not fully 
understood. We analyzed serum samples from 34 patients who were seen at a city 
hospital in Sendai, Japan, between January 1997 and December 2002, and who had 
been given the diagnosis of sporadic acute hepatitis of non-A, non-B, non-C 
etiology. Among these 34 patients, 3 (9%; all men; aged 54, 59, and 61 years) 
were positive for both IgG and IgM anti-HEV antibodies and for HEV RNA. The HEV 
isolates (HE-JAS1 and HE-JAS3) obtained from case 1 and case 3, respectively, 
segregated into genotype III; they had the highest nucleotide sequence identity, 
of 99.5% and 99.0%, with HE-JA7 and HE-JA8, respectively, both of which had been 
isolated in Iwate, a neighboring prefecture of Sendai. In contrast, the 
remaining HEV isolate (HE-JAS2), obtained from case 2, segregated into genotype 
IV; it had the highest nucleotide sequence identity, of 99.8% and 99.3%, with 
JKK-Sap and HE-JA3, respectively, both of which had been isolated in Hokkaido, 
Japan, although case 2 had never been to Hokkaido. Our three patients with 
hepatitis E had not traveled abroad in the preceding 1 year, had had no contact 
with pigs, and no history of blood transfusion. These results indicate that HEV 
should be considered as an etiological agent of acute hepatitis of non-A, non-B, 
non-C etiology in Japan. The risk factor(s) for acquiring domestic HEV infection 
in Japan needs to be clarified in future studies.

We attempted the isolation of variant infectious bursal disease (IBD) viruses by 
using sentinel chickens immunized with inactivated classical-type IBD vaccine. 
Immunized sentinel chickens with high levels of neutralizing antibodies and 
non-immunized sentinel chickens were raised together with broiler chickens in a 
commercial farm. Severe atrophy of the bursa of Fabricius was observed from the 
second week after cohabitation in non-immunized sentinel chickens. However, in 
immunized sentinel chickens and broiler chickens, atrophy was observed from the 
third week after cohabitation. The IBD virus (IBDV) isolated from the bursa of 
Fabricius of immunized sentinel chickens, designated as strain IBDV TY2, showed 
severe atrophy of the bursa in infected SPF chickens. Antiserum to the IBDV TY2 
strain showed higher neutralizing activity to heterologous IBDV strains than did 
antiserum to the K strain vaccine virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 
nucleotide sequences encoding the hypervariable region of virus protein 2 of the 
IBDV TY2 strain did not cluster with the classical, variant or very virulent 
IBDV groups. Based on these results, we suggest that the IBDV TY2 strain may 
constitute a novel variant type of IBDV.

Between 2006 and 2009, seven strains of infectious bronchitis (IB) virus (IBV) 
were isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks on different chicken farms in 
China. The pathogenic characters of seven IBV strains were assessed. Each of the 
seven strains was infective to the test chickens and could induce an immune 
response. The results from chicken embryo cross-neutralization assays showed 
that these strains were antigenically distinct from classic IBV strains of H120, 
M41, Conn, and Gray. Compared to H120 vaccine strain, point mutation, short 
insertion, and deletion occurred at many positions in the S1 protein of the 
seven strains. Five of the seven strains had the motif (HRRRR), which was 
identical to that of the epidemic IBV strains in China. Two new motifs (HRLRR 
and RRIRR) emerged in the isolated strains. The homology of the nucleotide and 
amino acid sequences of the S1 gene among the seven isolates was 81.7%-99.7% and 
79.0%-99.4%, respectively. These seven strains were also genetically different 
from the vaccine strains and non-China IBV strains but closely related to large 
numbers of Chinese strains. The seven isolates and 36 reference IBV strains were 
clustered into six distinct groups (I-VI). The seven strains were categorized 
into groups I, II, and III, forming a big phylogenetic branch, which is closely 
related to Chinese IBVs, whereas the vaccine strains belonging to group VI are 
genetically distant from groups I, II, and III. The results from this study 
indicate that different IBV strains cocirculate in the chicken population in 
China.

Failed detection of <i>Bovine viral diarrhea virus 2</i> subgenotype a (BVDV-2a) by direct fluorescent antibody test on tissue samples due to reduced reactivity of field isolates to raw anti-BVDV antibody,"<jats:p> Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) is associated with mild or subclinical infections, whereas BVDV-2 is frequently implicated in outbreaks of severe thrombocytopenia and acute fatal disease. In the present study, the carcass of a beef breed cow and tissue samples of a beef calf were received for laboratory diagnosis. Both animals exhibited severe clinical signs compatible with thrombocytopenia or hemorrhagic syndrome. Direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) failed to detect BVDV antigen in the tissue specimens of both cases. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed the presence of BVDV antigen in oral and esophageal mucosa and Peyer patches of the beef breed cow. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) detected BVDV-2 in selected tissues of both animals. Subsequently, BVDV was isolated from both cases and subjected to genetic and serologic characterizations. Mutations in the 5′–untranslated genomic region (5′-UTR) primer and probe binding sites and the E2 gene were associated with reduced efficiency of an established real-time RT-PCR assay and amino acid alterations in the E2 glycoprotein, respectively. Both viral isolates were classified by real-time RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis as BVDV-2 subgenotype a. Unlike BVDV reference strains Singer and 125c, the isolates cross-reacted with anti–BVDV-1 and anti–BVDV-2 reference sera, indicating antigenic variations in field isolates. The isolates also showed reduced reactivity to porcine anti-BVDV antiserum (the raw serum used to produce BVDV DFA conjugate). In summary, data from the present investigation indicated that genetic and antigenic variations affected the performance of detection assays, especially DFAT, highlighting the need for regular evaluation and modification of BVDV tests. </jats:p>",0

Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) is an infectious pathogen that can cause epidemics in 
egg-laying ducks. Here, we isolated and characterized a DTMUV, designated 
GDLH01, thought to be responsible for the noticeable egg drop in Muscovy duck 
flocks in South China since 2011. The genome sequence of GDLH01 shared 97-99% 
homology with other avian-origin Tembusu viruses, and 99.5% homology with the 
mosquito-borne strain SDMS recently reported in China. Phylogenetic analysis 
based on the nucleotide sequence of the entire open reading frame confirmed that 
the isolate was of avian origin and closely related to a mosquito-borne strain. 
Our findings characterize a novel Tembusu virus circulating in Muscovy ducks in 
South China and emphasize the importance of reinforcing biosecurity measures and 
developing vaccines to prevent the spread of this viral pathogen.

(LPMs) and poultry slaughterhouses in Shanghai, China in 2013. All viruses were 
characterized by whole-genome sequencing with subsequent genetic comparison and 
phylogenetic analysis. The hemagglutinin cleavage site of all viruses indicated 
that the five strains were low-pathogenic AIVs. Phylogenetic analysis of all 
eight viral genes showed that the five H3N2 viruses clustered in the Eurasian 
lineage of influenza viruses. The eight genes showed evidence of reassortment 
events between these H3 subtype viruses and other subtype viruses, especially H5 
and H7 subtypes, probably in pigeons, domestic ducks, and wild birds. These 
findings emphasized the importance of AIV surveillance in LPMs and poultry 
slaughterhouses for understanding the genesis and emergence of novel 
reassortants with pandemic potential.

Bluetongue is endemic in China, and Bluetongue virus (BTV) strains belonging to 
eight different serotypes (BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-3, BTV-4, BTV-9, BTV-12, BTV-15 and 
BTV-16) had been isolated between 1996 and 1997. However, there has been a long 
pause in investigating the epidemiology of BTV infection since then. During 
2012-2014, eight BTV strains belonging to serotypes 5, 7 and 24 were isolated 
for the first time in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces from the blood of sentinel 
animals. Phylogenetic analyses of genome segment 2 of these Chinese BTV strains 
grouped them into nucleotypes E, F and A, respectively, along with the reference 
strains of the same serotype. For each serotype, Chinese strains cluster 
together closely to form a China's sublineage. In addition, these strains were 
most closely related to strains from Africa, indicating that they may share a 
recent common ancestry with African strains. To our knowledge, this is the first 
time that BTV-5, BTV-7 and BTV-24 strains have been isolated in South-East Asia. 
These data will be beneficial for understanding the BTV epidemiology and 
improving diagnostic assays and control measures against bluetongue in China and 
its neighbouring countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

Ticks are medically-important arthropods that maintain and transmit numerous 
emerging viruses. China suffers severely from tick-borne viral diseases such as 
tick-borne encephalitis and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), 
but the background of tick-borne viruses is very limited. Here we report the 
virome profiling of ticks and goat sera from SFTS-epidemic areas, and 
serological investigation of SFTS virus (SFTSV) and Nairobi sheep disease virus 
(NSDV). Results revealed divergent viruses in ticks and goat sera, including 
SFTSV and NSDV. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the SFTSV 
identified here was most closely related to human SFTSV in sampling and 
surrounding areas, and the NSDV to the previously identified NSDV from northeast 
China. Serological investigation of SFTSV infection in goats revealed intensive 
activity in those areas. Surprisingly, two different methods of NSDV serological 
investigation showed no sera positive for this virus.

Chapparvovirus, a recently determined new genus in the family Parvoviridae, can 
infect many species of animals including bats, chickens, and pigs. Here, using 
viral metagenomics method, we identified a novel Chapparvovirus from feces of 
wild rats and designated it as rat parvovirus 2 (RPV2). The nearly complete 
genome of RPV2 is 4222-nt long and includes two ORFs encoding a 654-aa 
nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and a 472-aa capsid protein (VP), respectively. 
Phylogenetic analysis over the amino acid sequence of the NS1 showed that RPV2 
clustered with Eidolon helvum parvovirus 2 (EHPV2), porcine parvovirus 7 (PPV7), 
and turkey parvovirus 1 (TP1), forming a separate clade. Sequence analysis 
indicated that the NS1 protein of RPV2 shared the highest amino acid sequence 
identity (51 %) with that of EHPV2. According to the genetic distance-based 
criteria, RPV2 identified here belongs to a novel species of Chapparvovirus.

Bocaviruses have been found in the feces of humans and a variety of animals, 
including pigs, cattle, dogs, gorillas, cats, and sea lions. Here, we have 
characterized the almost complete genome (5224 nt) of a novel bocavirus from 
feces of domestic minks, which has been provisionally named mink bocavirus. The 
NS1 protein of mink bocavirus shared 36.9-52 % amino acid sequence identities 
with those of other known bocaviruses and phylogenetically clustered with 
bocaviruses from other carnivores. According to the genetic distance-based 
criteria, mink bocavirus qualifies as a novel species of bocavirus. PCR of feces 
from a group of domestic minks, which included both healthy animals and animals 
suffering from diarrhea, revealed that 30 % (9/30) shed virus. However, no 
association between viral shedding and the presence of diarrhea could be 
determined.

Using a high-throughput DNA sequencing method, one DNA sequence (contig01006), 
suspected to belong to a novel porcine bocavirus (PBoV), was found with a high 
rate of detection (19.6 %) in fecal samples from healthy piglets. Moreover, a 
novel PBoV (tentatively named PBoV3C) with a nearly complete genome sequence 
(5235 bp) was identified. PBoV3C exhibits typical genome characteristics of 
bocaviruses and shows the highest genomic sequence identity (78 % to 81 %) to 
PBoV3A/B (PBoV3/4-UK) and PBoV3D/E (PBoV3/4-HK), respectively. Phylogenetic and 
recombination analysis indicated high diversity, prevalence and complexity among 
the PBoVs. The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) site of VP1 and the secondary structure 
of VP2 of PBoV3C were also analyzed. Additionally, we propose a uniform method 
of PBoV nomenclature based on the VP1 gene.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) can cause a highly contagious and acute 
respiratory disease in poultry. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of 
crucial regulators for gene expression and are involved in the regulation of 
virus defence and immunological processes. To understand miRNA regulation in 
chickens in response to IBV infection, high-throughput sequencing was performed 
to compare the small RNA libraries from the kidneys of chicken infected with 
SCK2, SCDY2 and LDT3-A. By comparing these data to healthy chickens, a total of 
58 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified. The DE miRNAs were 
further classified into five miRNA expression patterns (up or down regulation 
compared to control). Using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment prediction, the DE 
miRNAs were shown to be mostly associated with metabolic processes, catalytic 
activities, gene expression, binding activities and immune responses. Seven 
highly expressed miRNAs (gga-miR-30d, gga-miR-1454, gga-miR-7b, gga-miR-215-5p, 
gga-miR-1a-3p, gga-miR-3538 and gga-miR-2954) were selected for miRNA-mRNA 
conjoint analysis. Furthermore, the miRNAs inversely correlated with the 
corresponding target gene mRNAs. These seven miRNAs were considered to play an 
important role in IBV-host interactions and the differing virulence of IBV 
strains. This is the first demonstration that infection with different virulent 
IBVs elicits different expression of miRNAs in chicken kidneys; this expression 
also seems to be associated with the virulence of IBV. These results are 
significant for the study of immune responses to infection with different 
virulent IBVs mediated by miRNAs as well as the interaction between the chicken 
host and IBV.

Novel characteristics of the avian gyrovirus 2 genome,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2) was the second member of the viral genus <jats:italic>Cyclovirus</jats:italic> to be discovered. This virus poses a significant potential threat to humans and poultry due to its global dissemination and infectiousness. We used three overlapping polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to map the whole genome of AGV2. We then modelled the evolutionary history of these novel sequence data in the context of related sequences from GenBank. We analysed the viral protein characteristics of the different phylogenetic groups and explored differences in evolutionary trends between Chinese strains and strains from other countries. We obtained 17 avian-sourced AGV2 whole genomes from different regions of China from 2015 to 2016. Phylogenetic analyses of these Chinese AGV2 sequences and related sequences produced four distinct groups (A–D) with significant bootstrap values. We also built phylogenies using predicted viral protein sequences. We found a potential hypervariable region in VP1 at sites 288–314, and we identified the amino acid changes responsible for the distinct VP2 and VP3 groups. Three new motifs in the AGV2 5′-UTR direct repeat (DR) region were discovered and grouped. The novel characteristics and diverse research on the AGV2 genome provide a valuable framework for additional research.</jats:p>",0

In chickens, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) often causes respiratory 
distress, a decrease in egg production, poor egg quality, and occasional 
nephritis. However, ZZ2004, a Chinese isolate of IBV, was obtained from ducks 
with clinical growth suppression and mild respiratory symptoms that had been 
reared with chickens in the central region of China. Virus isolation, virus 
neutralization testing, and RT-PCR were employed to identify the causative 
pathogen, while sequence alignment was used to analyze gene variations of the S1 
subunit and M genes. The results showed that the ducks were infected with IBV 
due to the emergence of a dwarfing phenotype and the death of embryos between 48 
and 144 h post-inoculation. RT-PCR also confirmed the presence of the expected 
fragment sizes of the S1 subunit and M genes by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the results 
of the virus neutralization test indicated that the strains of JX/99/01, GD, 
SAIBK, LDT3 showed cross-reactivity with the ZZ2004 isolate, and hardly any 
cross-neutralization of IBV ZZ2004 was observed with the strains of M41, H120, 
Gray, Holte, or Aust-T. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that there were large 
differences between ZZ2004 and other IBV reference strains on the S1 subunit. 
Meanwhile, homologies in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the M gene 
of IBV ZZ2004 were 86.9-92.0 % and 91.1-93.9 %, respectively, compared with 35 
other IBV reference strains derived from different regions. This result revealed 
that there were conspicuous variations among the selected strains. Furthermore, 
the results showed that the prevalent strains of IBV in ducks had no antigen 
homology with the vaccine strains widely used in China except the LDT3-strain, 
making it urgent to explore and develop new IBV vaccines.

To better understand the virulence differentiation of <jats:italic>S. suis</jats:italic> and develop a promising vaccine, we isolated and sequenced a native avirulent <jats:italic>S. suis</jats:italic> strain (05HAS68). Animal experiments revealed that 05HAS68 is an avirulent strain and could protect piglets from the attack of virulent strains. Comparative genomics analyses demonstrated the genetic basis for the lack of virulence in 05HAS68, which is characterized by the absence of some important virulence-associated factors and the intact 89K pathogenicity island. Lack of virulence was also illustrated by reduced survival of 05HAS68 compared to a virulent strain in pig whole blood. Further investigations revealed a large-scale genomic rearrangement in 05HAS68, which was proposed to be mediated by transposase genes and/or prophages. This genomic rearrangement may have caused the genomic diversity of <jats:italic>S. suis</jats:italic> and resulted in biological discrepancies between 05HAS68 and highly virulent <jats:italic>S. suis</jats:italic> strains.</jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: In April 2009, a novel swine-derived influenza A virus (H1N1pdm) 
emerged and rapidly spread around the world, including Japan. It has been 
suggested that the virus can bind to both 2,3- and 2,6-linked sialic acid 
receptors in infected mammals, in contrast to contemporary seasonal H1N1 
viruses, which have a predilection for 2,6-linked sialic acid.
METHODS/RESULTS: To elucidate the existence and transmissibility of α2,3 sialic 
acid-specific viruses in H1N1pdm, amino acid substitutions within viral 
hemagglutinin molecules were investigated, especially D187E, D222G, and Q223R, 
which are related to a shift from human to avian receptor specificity. Samples 
from individuals infected during the first and second waves of the outbreak in 
Japan were examined using a high-throughput sequencing approach. In May 2009, 
three specimens from mild cases showed D222G and/or Q223R substitutions in a 
minor subpopulation of viruses infecting these individuals. However, the 
substitutions almost disappeared in the samples from five mild cases in December 
2010. The D187E substitution was not widespread in specimens, even in May 2009.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that α2,3 sialic acid-specific viruses, 
including G222 and R223, existed in humans as a minor population in the early 
phase of the pandemic, and that D222 and Q223 became more dominant through 
human-to-human transmission during the first and second waves of the epidemic. 
These results are consistent with the low substitution rates identified in 
seasonal H1N1 viruses in 2008.

Two human-infecting avian influenza viruses (AIVs), H7N9 and H10N8, have emerged 
in China, which further indicate that the H9N2 subtype of AIVs, as an internal 
gene donor, may have an important role in the generation of new viruses with 
cross-species transmissibility and pathogenicity. H9N2 viruses that contain such 
internal genes widely exist in poultry but are rarely reported in migratory 
birds. In this study, two strains of the H9N2 virus were isolated from fecal 
samples of migratory birds in 2014: one strain from Caizi Lake in Anhui Province 
and one from Chen Lake in Hubei Province of China. Nucleotide sequence analysis 
revealed high homology of all six internal genes of these two strains with the 
internal genes of the human H10N8 virus in Jiangxi Province, as well as with the 
human H7N9 virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a possible origin of these two 
strains from poultry in South China. Both of the two viruses tested could 
replicated in respiratory organs of infective mice without adaption, by both 
strains of the H9N2 AIVs from wild birds, suggesting their potential capacity 
for directly infecting mammals. Our findings indicate the existence of H9N2 
viruses that contain internal genes highly homologous with human H10N8 or H7N9 
viruses. Wild birds can contribute to the spread of the H9N2 virus that contains 
the ""harmful"" internal gene complex, leading to gene rearrangement with other 
influenza viruses and to the generation of new pathogenic viruses. Therefore, 
strengthening AIV surveillance in wild birds can promote an understanding of the 
presence and prevalence of viruses and provide scientific evidence for the 
prevention and control of AIVs and human-infecting AIVs.

We have completed the genetic characterization of all eight gene segments for 
four low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. The objective of this study 
was to detect the presence of novel signatures that may serve as early warning 
indicators of the conversion of LPAI viruses to high pathogenic avian influenza 
(HPAI) viruses. This study included three H5N2 and one H5N3 viruses that were 
isolated from live poultry imported into Singapore as part of the national avian 
influenza virus (AIV) surveillance program. Based on the molecular criterion of 
the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), sequence analysis with the 
translated amino acid (aa) sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed the 
absence of multibasic aa at the HA cleavage site, identifying all four virus 
isolates as LPAI. Detailed phylogenetic tree analyses using the HA and 
neuraminidase (NA) genes clustered these isolates in the Eurasian H5 lineage, 
but away from the HPAI H5 subtypes. This analysis further revealed that the 
internal genes clustered to different avian and swine subtypes, suggesting that 
the four isolates may possibly share their ancestry with these different 
influenza subtypes. Our results suggest that the four LPAI isolates in this 
study contained mainly avian signatures, and the phylogenetic tree for the 
internal genes further suggests the potential for reassortment with other 
different circulating avian subtypes. This is the first comprehensive report on 
the genetic characterization of LPAI H5N2/3 viruses isolated in South-East Asia.

Sapoviruses (SaVs) belong to the Sapovirus genus, in the family Caliciviridae. 
They have been associated with gastroenteritis in humans and in pigs but not in 
other animals. In addition, some strains from pigs, chimpanzees and rodents show 
close sequence identity with human SaVs thereby suggesting the possibility of 
interspecies transmissions. Bats are known to be a major reservoir of zoonotic 
viruses, however, very little is known about the genetic diversity of SaVs in 
bats. To explore the genetic diversity of bat SaVs, fecal samples of Eidolon 
helvum and Epomophorus gambianus were treated according to the NetoVIR protocol 
and sequenced by Illumina technology. Nearly complete genome sequences of six 
highly divergent SaVs and one partial SaV (only VP1 region) were identified in 
Eidolon helvum and based on sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis, they 
potentially represent two novel genogroups, only distantly related to known 
SaVs. Furthermore, comparing these sequences with currently used screening 
primers and probes indicated that the novel SaVs would not be detected in 
routine epidemiological screening studies in humans in case an interspecies 
transmission would occur. Therefore, we designed and validated new primers that 
can detect both human and bat SaVs. In this study, we identified multiple novel 
bat SaVs, however, further epidemiological studies in humans are needed to 
unravel their potential role in gastroenteritis.

Phylogenetic evidence for inter-typic recombination in the emergence of human enterovirus 71 subgenotypes.,"1. BMC Microbiol. 2006 Aug 30;6:74. doi: 10.1186/1471-2180-6-74.

Phylogenetic evidence for inter-typic recombination in the emergence of human 
enterovirus 71 subgenotypes.

BACKGROUND: Human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is a common causative agent of hand, 
foot and mouth disease (HFMD). In recent years, the virus has caused several 
outbreaks with high numbers of deaths and severe neurological complications. 
Several new EV-71 subgenotypes were identified from these outbreaks. The 
mechanisms that contributed to the emergence of these subgenotypes are unknown.
RESULTS: Six EV-71 isolates from an outbreak in Malaysia, in 1997, were 
sequenced completely. These isolates were identified as EV-71 subgenotypes, B3, 
B4 and C2. A phylogenetic tree that correlated well with the present enterovirus 
classification scheme was established using these full genome sequences and all 
other available full genome sequences of EV-71 and human enterovirus A (HEV-A). 
Using the 5' UTR, P2 and P3 genomic regions, however, isolates of EV-71 
subgenotypes B3 and C4 segregated away from other EV-71 subgenotypes into a 
cluster together with coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16/G10) and EV-71 subgenotype C2 
clustered with CV-A8. Results from the similarity plot analyses supported the 
clustering of these isolates with other HEV-A. In contrast, at the same genomic 
regions, a CV-A16 isolate, Tainan5079, clustered with EV-71. This suggests that 
amongst EV-71 and CV-A16, only the structural genes were conserved. The 3' end 
of the virus genome varied and consisted of sequences highly similar to various 
HEV-A viruses. Numerous recombination crossover breakpoints were identified 
within the non-structural genes of some of these newer EV-71 subgenotypes.
CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic evidence obtained from analyses of the full genome 
sequence supports the possible occurrence of inter-typic recombination involving 
EV-71 and various HEV-A, including CV-A16, the most common causal agent of HFMD. 
It is suggested that these recombination events played important roles in the 
emergence of the various EV-71 subgenotypes.

To trace the genetic history of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 
virus (PRRSV), we determined the complete sequences of ORFs 5 to 7 of four PRRSV 
isolates. These sequences were analyzed together with published sequences from 
146 isolates from various parts of the world using a Bayesian coalescent 
approach as well as Bayesian inference and maximum-likelihood methods. All of 
the European-type (EU-type) viruses were classified into one of two groups or 
unclassified (4 isolates), while all North American-type (NA-type) viruses 
belonged to one of three major groups or were unclassified (5 isolates). Within 
each genotype, no apparent periodic and/or geographic influence on the evolution 
of PRRSVs was observed. The evolutionary rate of PRRSV isolates was estimated to 
be 1.55 × 10(-3) substitutions/site/year, and the time of the most recent common 
ancestor (TMRCA) was 491.2 years ago. Here, the TMRCA for the EU- and NA-type 
viruses was 58.7 and 62.6 years ago, respectively. A Bayesian skyline plot 
revealed that the viruses evolved at an almost constant population size until 
the late 1970s, when they experienced a population expansion that continued 
until the late 1980s. The population size then remained constant again until the 
early 2000s, when a rapid, sharp decline in the effective number of infections 
occurred.

This report describes the use of Bayesian methods to analyze polyprotein coding 
region sequences (n = 217) obtained from GenBank to define the genome-wide 
phylogeny of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). The results strongly supported 
the monophyly of five FMDV serotypes, O, A, Asia 1, C, and SAT 3, while 
sequences for the two remaining FMDV serotypes, SAT 1 and SAT 2 did not separate 
into entirely distinct clades. The phylogenomic tree revealed three sister-group 
relationships, serotype O + Asia 1, A + C, and SAT 1 + 3 + 2, with a new 
branching pattern: {[(O, Asia 1), (A, C)], (SAT 1, 2, 3)}. Within each serotype, 
there was no apparent periodic, geographic, or host species influence on the 
evolution of global FMDVs. Analysis of the polyprotein coding region of these 
sequences provided evidence for the influence of purifying selection on the 
evolution of FMDV. Using a Bayesian coalescent approach, the evolutionary rate 
of FMDV isolates that circulated during the years 1932-2007 was estimated to be 
1.46 × 10(-3) substitutions/site/year, and the most recent common ancestor of 
the virus existed approximately 481 years ago. Bayesian skyline plot revealed a 
population expansion in the early 20(th) century that was followed by a rapid 
decline in population size from the late 20(th) century to the present day. 
These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms that impact on the 
evolution of this important livestock pathogen.

Polymerase Chain Reaction–based Genetic Typing of Japanese Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Viruses,"<jats:p> Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSVs) are classified into 2 distinct genotypes: the North American type and the European type. The Japanese PRRSVs were genotyped by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction using the reported primer pairs that were either reactive to both types, specific to the North American type or specific to the European type. All the PRRSV genomes from 66 tissue homogenates or sera and 55 infectious viruses were of the North American type, whereas no European-type viral genome was detected. Two PCR primers specific to the North American type showed different detection efficiency. Half of the tissue samples and 15% of the infectious viruses were not detected with one primer pair, although all of them were detected with the other primer pair. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of the forward-and reverse primer–binding sites of the nonreactive viruses indicated that all these viruses had nucleotide mismatches within the 4 bases corresponding to the 3′ end of the reverse primer. These mismatches appeared to be responsible for the nonreactivity of the former primers to these viruses. </jats:p>",0

BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne infectious disease 
caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). About 1-10 cases with severe 
central nervous system symptoms have been constantly reported every year in 
Japan. To clarify the mechanism of maintenance of JEV, the present study 
surveyed pigs for serological evidence of JEV infection and isolated JEV strains 
from pigs and mosquitoes in Isahaya City (Isahaya) and Goto City (Goto) in the 
islets of Goto in Nagasaki Prefecture from 2008 to 2014.
RESULTS: The serological survey of pigs showed the increase of IgM 
sero-positivity against JEV in July or August, and it was maintained until 
October or November in both Isahaya and Goto every year. There were 47 JEV 
strains isolated in Nagasaki from 2001 to 2014 including the isolates in this 
study, and they belonged to genotype 1. Thirty four of the isolated strains were 
from pigs in Isahaya and were classified under six subclusters (1-A-1, 1-A-2, 
1-A-3, 1-A-4, 1-A-5, and 1-A-9). Thirteen strains were isolated from pigs and 
mosquitoes in Goto and were classified into three subclusters (1-A-5 (2008); 
1-A-1 (2009); and 1-A-2). In the subcluster 1-A-2, three different monophyletic 
subgroups, 1-A-2-2 (2010), 1-A-2-3 (2011), and 1-A-2-1 (2013, 2014), appeared in 
Goto.
CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggested that JEV appearance in Goto seems to 
depend on the frequent introduction of JEV from outside of the island and this 
pattern is different from what has been observed in subtropical islands in the 
East China Sea such as Okinawa and Taiwan, where the same populations of JEV 
(1-A-7 (1998-2008) in Okinawa; genotype 3 (until 2012) in Taiwan) have been 
maintained for a long period.

"Molecular epidemiology of coxsackievirus A6 derived from hand, foot, and mouth disease in Fukuoka between 2013 and 2017","<jats:p>Coxsackievirus (CV)‐A6 has been the primary causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in Japan since 2011. In Fukuoka, CV‐A6‐associated HFMD caused epidemics in 2013, 2015, and 2017. This paper reports the genetic characteristics of the CV‐A6 entire viral protein 1 (VP1) derived from patients with HFMD in Fukuoka between 2013 and 2017. CV‐A6 was detected in 105 of 280 clinical specimens, and the entire VP1 sequences could be analyzed for 90 of the 105 specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CV‐A6 strains were classified into clade A and subgrouped into subclade A3 or subclade A4. Each subclade strain carried amino acid substitutions in the presumed DE and GH loops of the VP1, and no amino acid substitutions were identified as deleterious to the protein function. No significant difference was found in the clinical symptoms between the genetic subclades using statistical analyses. In conclusion, this study clarified the genetic diversity of CV‐A6 in Fukuoka from 2013 to 2017. The emergence of the CV‐A6 strains was classified into derived new subclades based on phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene that may cause CV‐A6‐associated HFMD epidemics approximately every 2 years.</jats:p>",0

As pigs are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses, they have 
been proposed to be intermediate hosts or mixing vessels for the generation of 
pandemic influenza viruses through reassortment or adaptation to the mammalian 
host. In this study, we reported avian-like H1N1 and novel ressortant H1N2 
influenza viruses from pigs in China. Homology and phylogenetic analyses showed 
that the H1N1 virus (A/swine/Zhejiang/1/07) was closely to avian-like H1N1 
viruses and seemed to be derived from the European swine H1N1 viruses, which was 
for the first time reported in China; and the two H1N2 viruses 
(A/swine/Shanghai/1/07 and A/swine/Guangxi/13/06) were novel ressortant H1N2 
influenza viruses containing genes from the classical swine (HA, NP, M and NS), 
human (NA and PB1) and avian (PB2 and PA) lineages, which indicted that the 
reassortment among human, avian, and swine influenza viruses had taken place in 
pigs in China and resulted in the generation of new viruses. The isolation of 
avian-like H1N1 influenza virus originated from the European swine H1N1 viruses, 
especially the emergence of two novel ressortant H1N2 influenza viruses provides 
further evidence that pigs serve as intermediate hosts or ""mixing vessels"", and 
swine influenza virus surveillance in China should be given a high priority.

Pandemic strains of influenza A virus might arise by genetic reassortment 
between viruses from different hosts. Pigs are susceptible to both human and 
avian influenza viruses and have been proposed to be intermediate hosts or 
mixing vessels, for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses through 
reassortment or adaptation to the mammalian host. In this study, we summarize 
and report for the first time the coexistence of 10 (A-J) genotypes in pigs in 
China by analyzing the eight genes of 28 swine H9N2 viruses isolated in China 
from 1998 to 2007. Swine H9N2 viruses in genotype A and B were completely 
derived from Y280-like and Shanghai/F/98-like viruses, respectively, which 
indicated avian-to-pig interspecies transmission of H9N2 viruses did exist in 
China. The other eight genotype (C-J) viruses might be double-reassortant 
viruses, in which six genotype (E-J) viruses possessed 1-4 H5-like gene segments 
indicating they were reassortants of H9 and H5 viruses. In conclusion, genetic 
diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses from pigs in China provides further evidence 
that avian to pig interspecies transmission of H9N2 viruses did occur and might 
result in the generation of new reassortant viruses by genetic reassortment with 
swine H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses, therefore, these swine H9N2 
influenza viruses might be a potential threat to human health and continuing to 
carry out swine influenza virus surveillance in China is of great significance.

Classical swine and avian-like H1N1 influenza viruses were reported widely in 
swine population worldwide, but human-like H1N1 swine viruses were reported 
occasionally. In 2006, a human-like H1N1 swine virus (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06) 
was isolated from pigs in Guangdong province, which was reported in China for 
the first time. To get further evidence for infection of pigs with human-like 
H1N1 influenza viruses, we analyzed eight gene segments of three human-like 
swine H1N1 viruses (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06, A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and 
A/swine/Henan/01/06) isolated in China. All the eight genes of the three viruses 
are highly homologous to recent (about 2000) and early (1980s) human H1N1 
influenza viruses, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 
A/Swine/Guangdong/96/06 was directly derived from about 2000 human H1N1 
influenza viruses, while A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A/swine/Henan/01/06 seemed to 
be descendants of human H1N1 viruses circulating in 1980s. Seroprevalence of our 
isolate (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06) confirmed the presence of human-like H1N1 
virus in pigs in China. Existence of these influenza viruses, especially older 
viruses (A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A/swine/Henan/01/06), indicates that 
human-like H1N1 influenza viruses may remain invariant for long periods in pigs 
and provides the evidence that pigs serve as reservoirs of older influenza 
viruses for human pandemics.

In this study, we describe a novel porcine parechovirus-like virus (tentatively 
named PLV-CHN) from healthy piglets in China using 454 high-throughput 
sequencing. The complete genome of the virus comprises 6832 bp, encoding a 
predicted polyprotein of 2132 amino acids that is most similar to Ljungan virus 
(32% identity). A similar virus that belongs to a novel Picornaviridae genus, 
named swine pasivirus 1 (SPaV-1), was reported during the preparation of this 
paper. Sequence analysis revealed that PLV-CHN and SPaV1 shared 82% nucleotide 
identity and 89% amino acid identity. Further genomic and phylogenetic analyses 
suggested that both SPaV1 and PLV-CHN shared similar genomic characteristics and 
belong to the same novel Picornaviridae genus. A total of 36 (20.0%) fecal 
samples from 180 healthy piglets were positive for PLV-CHN by RT-PCR, while no 
fecal samples from 100 healthy children and 100 children with diarrhea, and no 
cerebrospinal fluid samples from 196 children with suspected viral encephalitis, 
was positive for the virus. However, Western blot and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays using recombinant PLV-CHN VP1 polypeptide as an antigen 
showed a high seroprevalence of 63.5% in the healthy population. When grouped by 
age, the antibody-positivity rates showed that the majority of children under 12 
years of age have been infected by the virus. It was suggested that PLV-CHN, 
SPaV1, or an as-yet-uncharacterized virus can infect humans early in life. Thus, 
investigation of the role of this novel virus is vital.

Swine pseudorabies (PR) re-emerged in Bartha-vaccinated pig herds and caused 
death of millions of piglets in China since the later part of 2011. We isolated 
a novel pseudorabies virus (PRV), named HNX strain, from the brain of abortion 
fetuses to diagnose the disease. To reveal the genomic organization and 
characterize the HNX strain, the complete genomes of HNX and Fa strain, an 
isolate in the 1960s, were sequenced and analyzed. The genomic size of HNX and 
Fa strains were 142,294 and 141,930 nt, respectively, with corresponding G + C 
contents of 73.56 and 73.70 %. The two strains consistently possessed 70 open 
reading frames. In addition, comparative genomic analysis between HNX and Bartha 
strains was performed to understand the possible reason of immune failure. The 
major virulence-associated genes of HNX strain had slight changes, whereas 
glycoprotein B and glycoprotein C genes of HNX strain had 73 mutations; the 
homology at the whole genomic level between HNX and Bartha strains was 90.6 %. 
Genome-wide comparison between HNX and Fa strains indicated that the strains 
shared about 96.4 % of homology and clustered in a separate Chinese isolate 
group; the two strains are also distant from the isolates from other countries. 
Similarity plot and bootscanning analysis of complete genome sequences of nine 
PRV strains, including HNX and Fa, four newly Chinese strains, and three 
traditional reference strains, revealed that non-recombination events occurred 
in the HNX strain. The PRV HNX strain with genomic variations might contribute 
to the PR outbreak in China since the later part of 2011.

Influenza H7N9 and H9N2 Viruses: Coexistence in Poultry Linked to Human H7N9 Infection and Genome Characteristics,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Avian influenza virus A of the novel H7N9 reassortant subtype was recently found to cause severe human respiratory infections in China. Live poultry markets were suspected locations of the human H7N9 infection sources, based on the cases' exposure histories and sequence similarities between viral isolates. To explore the role of live poultry markets in the origin of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental specimens from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as well as high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified specimens positive for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all of the 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks, and environmental specimens from the markets contained heavily mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2 and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea of the coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, human H7N9 infection cases (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 31) were all negative for H9N2 virus according to real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2, and internal-segment sequences were very close to the sequence of the H9N2 virus circulating in chickens in China recently. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains coexisted with the novel human-pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically linked live poultry markets. Avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus and continues to do so.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Our results suggest that avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus, a novel reassortant avian influenza virus A subtype, and continues to do so. The finding helps shed light on how the H7N9 virus emerged, spread, and transmitted to humans. It is of considerable interest for assessing the risk of the possible emergence of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced transmissibility to humans.

Newly Emergent Highly Pathogenic H5N9 Subtype Avian Influenza A Virus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The novel H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) was demonstrated to cause severe human respiratory infections in China. Here, we examined poultry specimens from live bird markets linked to human H7N9 infection in Hangzhou, China. Metagenomic sequencing revealed mixed subtypes (H5, H7, H9, N1, N2, and N9). Subsequently, AIV subtypes H5N9, H7N9, and H9N2 were isolated. Evolutionary analysis showed that the hemagglutinin gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/LBM227/2012 (H5N1), which belongs to clade 2.3.2.1. The neuraminidase gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from 
human-infective A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9). The six internal genes were similar to those of other H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 virus strains. The virus harbored the PQRERRRKR/GL motif characteristic of highly pathogenic AIVs at the HA cleavage site. Receptor-binding experiments demonstrated that the virus binds α-2,3 sialic acid but not α-2,6 sialic acid. Identically, pathogenicity experiments also showed that the virus caused low mortality rates in mice. This newly isolated H5N9 virus is a highly pathogenic reassortant virus originating from H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes. Live bird markets represent a potential transmission risk to public health and the poultry industry.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            This investigation confirms that the novel H5N9 subtype avian influenza A virus is a reassortant strain originating from H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes and is totally different from the H5N9 viruses reported before. The novel H5N9 virus acquired a highly pathogenic H5 gene and an N9 gene from human-infecting subtype H7N9 but caused low mortality rates in mice. Whether this novel H5N9 virus will cause human infections from its avian host and become a pandemic subtype is not known yet. It is therefore imperative to assess the risk of emergence of this novel reassortant virus with potential transmissibility to public health.

Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is an avian retrovirus that causes 
immunosuppression, growth retardation, and oncogenesis in a variety of birds. 
REV infection is epidemic in many countries. In this study, we used 
high-throughput sequencing to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with REV 
infection. A total of 88 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in 
samples collected on days 21 and 28 post-REV infection. Possible target genes of 
the differentially expressed miRNAs were analyzed. We observed that expression 
of proapoptotic, proto-oncogene, and carcinogenic cytokine mRNAs was highly 
upregulated, whereas expression of antiapoptotic cytokine mRNAs was 
significantly downregulated. Our findings provide a potential link between miRNA 
expression and the pathogenesis of REV infection.

Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) can cause acute myocarditis in young pigs or 
reproductive failure in sows. In this study, an EMCV strain (BD2) was isolated 
from the suspected piglets with EMCV in China. It was identified by an indirect 
immunofluorescence assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. 
The virus could reproduce on BHK-21 cells and reach a peak titer by 16 hpi with 
maximum titers of 10(8.22)TCID50/0.1 ml. Phylogenetic analyses of open reading 
frame and the VP3/VP1 genes using neighbor-joining method revealed that EMCV 
isolates fell into two clusters: groups I and II. The BD2 isolate belonged to 
group I, along with strains NJ08, HB1, BJC3, CBNU, K3, K11, BEL-2887A, GX0601, 
GXLC, pEC9, and PV21, whereas four strains (D variant, EMCV-B, EMCV-D, and PV2) 
belonged to group II.

"Hepatitis E Virus: Foodborne, Waterborne and Zoonotic Transmission","<jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for epidemics and endemics of acute hepatitis in humans, mainly through waterborne, foodborne, and zoonotic transmission routes. HEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus classified in the family Hepeviridae and encompasses four known Genotypes (1–4), at least two new putative genotypes of mammalian HEV, and one floating genus of avian HEV. Genotypes 1 and 2 HEVs only affect humans, while Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic and responsible for sporadic and autochthonous infections in both humans and several other animal species worldwide. HEV has an ever-expanding host range and has been identified in numerous animal species. Swine serve as a reservoir species for HEV transmission to humans; however, it is likely that other animal species may also act as reservoirs. HEV poses an important public health concern with cases of the disease definitively linked to handling of infected pigs, consumption of raw and undercooked animal meats, and animal manure contamination of drinking or irrigation water. Infectious HEV has been identified in numerous sources of concern including animal feces, sewage water, inadequately-treated water, contaminated shellfish and produce, as well as animal meats. Many aspects of HEV pathogenesis, replication, and immunological responses remain unknown, as HEV is an extremely understudied but important human pathogen. This article reviews the current understanding of HEV transmission routes with emphasis on food and environmental sources and the prevalence of HEV in animal species with zoonotic potential in humans.</jats:p>",0

Search of metagenomics sequence databases for homologs of virophage capsid 
proteins resulted in the discovery of a new family of virophages in the sheep 
rumen metagenome. The genomes of the rumen virophages (RVP) encode a typical 
virophage major capsid protein, ATPase and protease combined with a 
Polinton-type, protein primed family B DNA polymerase. The RVP genomes appear to 
be linear molecules, with terminal inverted repeats. Thus, the RVP seem to 
represent virophage-Polinton hybrids that are likely capable of formation of 
infectious virions. Virion proteins of mimiviruses were detected in the same 
metagenomes as the RVP suggesting that the virophages of the new family 
parasitize on giant viruses that infect protist inhabitants of the rumen.

The phylogenetic analysis of VP1 sequences of the 39 type O foot and mouth virus 
(FMDV) isolates collected from different regions of India during the year of 
2001-12 revealed that all isolates belonged to the Middle East - South Asia 
(ME-SA) topotype. Based on the amount of divergence among the isolates, the 
viruses were further classified into three distinct lineages namely Ind 2001, 
PanAsia and PanAsia-2 as well as a minor, unnamed group. Ind 2001 lineage 
viruses accounted for most of the current type O outbreaks. At the nucleotide 
level these isolates showed a divergence of 2% to 14% with an average sequence 
variation of ~9.9%. The serological spectrum of the current vaccine strain was 
studied by using bovine vaccinate serum (BVS) raised against O/IND/R2/75. All 
the current field isolates (n=24) were homologous ('r' value 0.4 to 1.0) to the 
vaccine strain. Examination of the amino acid sequences for selection pressure 
revealed the positive selection at amino acid sites 13 and 45.

Mapping the virome in wild-caught Aedes aegypti from Cairns and Bangkok,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Medically important arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses are primarily transmitted by the globally distributed mosquito <jats:italic>Aedes aegypti</jats:italic>. Increasing evidence suggests that transmission can be influenced by mosquito viromes. Herein RNA-Seq was used to characterize RNA metaviromes of wild-caught <jats:italic>Ae</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>aegypti</jats:italic> from Bangkok (Thailand) and from Cairns (Australia). The two mosquito populations showed a high degree of similarity in their viromes. BLAST searches of assembled contigs suggest up to 27 insect-specific viruses may infect <jats:italic>Ae</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>aegypti</jats:italic>, with up to 23 of these currently uncharacterized and up to 16 infecting mosquitoes from both Cairns and Bangkok. Three characterized viruses dominated, Phasi Charoen-like virus, Humaita-Tubiacanga virus and Cell fusing agent virus, and comparisons with other available RNA-Seq datasets suggested infection levels with these viruses may vary in laboratory-reared mosquitoes. As expected, mosquitoes from Bangkok showed higher mitochondrial diversity and carried alleles associated with knock-down resistance to pyrethroids. Blood meal reads primarily mapped to human genes, with a small number also showing homology with rat/mouse and dog genes. These results highlight the wide spectrum of data that can be obtained from such RNA-Seq analyses, and suggests differing viromes may need to be considered in arbovirus vector competence studies.</jats:p>",0

The matrix protein gene was cloned and sequenced for several recent isolates of 
avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1). Specifically, isolates from pigeons and 
doves, members of the Columbidae family were examined. APMV-1 is the causative 
agent of Newcastle disease and the virus is associated with disease among a 
diverse number of avian species. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates from 
pigeons have also been classified as pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1). 
Matrix protein gene sequences for PPMV-1 isolates clustered together as a group 
relative to isolates from other species phylogenetically. However, there were 
also isolates from pigeons or doves that grouped with APMV-1 isolates from other 
species. This indicates that PPMV-1 may be circulating among Columbidae members 
as a distinct lineage, but that these avian species may also harbor other NDV 
strains as well. Of particular interest was a dove isolate from Europe that had 
an aberrant fusion protein cleavage site and was an outlying member 
phylogenetically between the two major groups of APMV-1 isolates.

In order to detect a large spectrum of small ruminant lentiviruses, primers for 
PCR were chosen in conserved parts of the LTR and GAG genes of Icelandic Visna 
virus 1514 and of the POL gene of caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus. This set 
of primers was tested in six different caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus 
(CAEV)- and Maedi-Visna virus isolates of Dutch, American and Swiss origin. The 
LTR primers allowed the detection of the corresponding fragments of all 
isolates. The GAG primers allowed amplification of the corresponding fragments 
of all but the Swiss Maedi-Visna virus strain OLV. Using the POL primers, one 
Maedi-Visna- and two caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus strains were detected 
after one round of amplification. Sequencing of the GAG and POL amplification 
products and comparison to Icelandic Visna virus and CAEV strain CO revealed 
total heterogeneity of 38% for the GAG- and 28% for the POL fragment. The virus 
strains studied fall into two groups which are more closely related to one 
another than to Icelandic Visna virus.

Hepatitis E virus is classified into four genotypes that have different 
geographical and host distributions. The main cause of sporadic autochthonous 
type E acute hepatitis in developed countries is genotype 3, which has a 
worldwide distribution and widely infects pigs. The aim of this study was to 
make hypotheses concerning the origin and global dispersion routes of this 
genotype by reconstructing the spatial and temporal dynamics of 208 HEV genotype 
3 ORF-2 sequences (retrieved from public databases) isolated in different 
geographical areas. The evolutionary rates, time of the most recent common 
ancestors (tMRCAs), epidemic growth and phylogeography of HEV-3 were 
co-estimated using a MCMC Bayesian method. The maximum clade credibility tree 
showed the existence of two distinct main clades: clade A, which consists of 
only European subtypes (HEV-3e and 3f), and clade B, which consists of European 
subtype 3c and all of the Asian subtypes (3a, 3b and 3d) sharing a common 
ancestor, which most probably existed in Asia in 1920s. All of the North 
American isolates belonged to Asian subtype 3a. On the basis of our time-scaled 
phylogeographical reconstruction, we hypothesise that after originating in the 
early 1800s in Europe, HEV reached Asia in the first decades of 1900, and then 
moved to America probably in the 1970s-1980s. Analysis of the skyline plot 
showed a sharp increase of the number of infections between the 1980s and 2005, 
thus suggesting the intervention of new and highly efficient routes of 
transmission possibly related to changes in the pig industry.

In the last decades a significant number of so far unknown or underestimated 
pathogens have emerged as fundamental health hazards of the human population 
despite intensive research and exceptional efforts of modern medicine to embank 
and eradicate infectious diseases. Almost all incidents caused by such emerging 
pathogens could be ascribed to agents that are zoonotic or expanded their host 
range and crossed species barriers. Many different factors influence the status 
of a pathogen to remain unnoticed or evolves into a worldwide threat. The 
ability of an infectious agent to adapt to changing environmental conditions and 
variations in human behavior, population development, nutrition, education, 
social, and health status are relevant factors affecting the correlation between 
pathogen and host. Hantaviruses belong to the emerging pathogens having gained 
more and more attention in the last decades. These viruses are members of the 
family Bunyaviridae and are grouped into a separate genus known as Hantavirus. 
The serotypes Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Puumala (PUU), and Dobrava (DOB) virus 
predominantly cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease 
characterized by renal failure, hemorrhages, and shock. In the recent past, many 
hantavirus isolates have been identified and classified in hitherto unaffected 
geographic regions in the New World (North, Middle, and South America) with 
characteristic features affecting the lungs of infected individuals and causing 
an acute pulmonary syndrome. Hantavirus outbreaks in the United States of 
America at the beginning of the 10th decade of the last century fundamentally 
changed our knowledge about the appearance of the hantavirus specific clinical 
picture, mortality, origin, and transmission route in human beings. The 
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in 1993 in the Four 
Corners Region of the United States and had a lethality of more than 50%. 
Although the causative virus was first termed in connection with the geographic 
name of its outbreak region the analysis of the individual viruses indicate that 
the causing virus of HPS was a genetically distinct hantavirus and consequently 
termed as Sin Nombre virus. Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are 
assumed to share a long time period of co-evolution with specific rodent species 
as their natural reservoir. The degree of relatedness between virus serotypes 
normally coincides with the relatedness between their respective hosts. There 
are no known diseases that are associated with hantavirus infections in rodents 
underlining the amicable relationship between virus and host developed by mutual 
interaction in hundreds of thousands of years. Although rodents are the major 
reservoir, antibodies against hantaviruses are also present in domestic and wild 
animals like cats, dogs, pigs, cattle, and deer. Domestic animals and rodents 
live jointly in a similar habitat. Therefore the transmission of hantaviruses 
from rodents to domestic animals seems to be possible, if the target organs, 
tissues, and cell parenchyma of the co-habitat domestic animals possess adequate 
virus receptors and are suitable for hantavirus entry and replication. The most 
likely incidental infection of species other than rodents as for example humans 
turns hantaviruses from harmless to life-threatening pathogenic agents focusing 
the attention on this virus group, their ecology and evolution in order to 
prevent the human population from a serious health risk. Much more studies on 
the influence of non-natural hosts on the ecology of hantaviruses are needed to 
understand the directions that the hantavirus evolution could pursue. At least, 
domestic animals that share their environmental habitat with rodents and humans 
particularly in areas known as high endemic hantavirus regions have to be 
copiously screened. Each transfer of hantaviruses from their original natural 
hosts to other often incidental hosts is accompanied by a change of ecology, a 
change of environment, a modulation of numerous factors probably influencing the 
pathogenicity and virulence of the virus. The new environment exerts a modified 
evolutionary pressure on the virus forcing it to adapt and probably to adopt a 
form that is much more dangerous for other host species compared to the original 
one.

ICTV Virus Taxonomy Profile: Picornaviridae,"<jats:p>The family <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic> comprises small non-enveloped viruses with RNA genomes of 6.7 to 10.1 kb, and contains &gt;30 genera and &gt;75 species. Most of the known picornaviruses infect mammals and birds, but some have also been detected in reptiles, amphibians and fish. Many picornaviruses are important human and veterinary pathogens and may cause diseases of the central nervous system, heart, liver, skin, gastrointestinal tract or upper respiratory tract. Most picornaviruses are transmitted by the faecal–oral or respiratory routes.

Molecular-based reclassification of the bovine enteroviruses,"<jats:p>Bovine enteroviruses are currently classified into two serotypes within the species<jats:italic>Bovine enterovirus</jats:italic>(BEV). Comparison of the sequences of six American and eleven German BEV isolates with published BEV sequences revealed the necessity to revise the taxonomy of these viruses. Molecular data indicate that the bovine enteroviruses are composed of two clusters (designated BEV-A and -B) each with two and three geno-/serotypes, respectively. Whereas low amino acid identity of the capsid proteins 1C (VP3) and 1D (VP1) is the main criterion for the discrimination of geno-/serotypes, the BEV clusters, presumably representing species, differ in sequence identity of all viral proteins. In addition, characteristic lengths of (i) the capsid proteins 1B, 1C and 1D, (ii) the 2C protein, and (iii) the 3′-non-translated region are observed. The BEVs can be distinguished from the other enteroviruses by sequence identity and unique features of the 5′-non-translated region, i.e. a conserved second cloverleaf and characteristic RNA structures of the internal ribosome entry site. Phylogenetically, the closest relatives of the bovine enteroviruses are the porcine enteroviruses. Incongruent phylogenies of the 5′-non-translated region, the capsid proteins and the 3D polymerase indicate frequent intraserotypic and interserotypic recombination within the non-capsid and the capsid region of the BEV genome.</jats:p>",0

Comparative genomics of viruses in evolutionary and phylogenetic studies is well 
established. Previous nucleic acid sequence analyses have demonstrated that 
enteroviruses and rhinoviruses of the family Picornaviridae exhibit a similar 
structure of the 5'-nontranslated region (NTR) differing significantly from the 
5'-NTR of cardiovirus, aphthovirus, hepatovirus, and echovirus 22 (provisionally 
parechovirus 1). Available nucleotide sequence information of the 5'- and 
3'-nontranslated regions of more than 70 serotypes of enteroviruses, bovine 
enteroviruses and rhinoviruses has been compared and correlated with previous 
findings obtained after analysis of the coding and noncoding genome regions. As 
a result, the 5'- and 3'-NTRs of all three virus groups are characterized by 
group-specific nucleotide sequences. Focusing on bovine enterovirus (BEV) 
serotypes, unique characteristics in all secondary structures of the NTRs were 
observed. These features clearly separate the BEVs from the human enteroviruses 
and rhinoviruses. Concerning the 5'-NTR, the most remarkable property is an 
insertion of about 110 nucleotides between the putative cloverleaf structure at 
the very 5'-end of the viral genome and the IRES element. This insertion was 
demonstrated for BEV 1 and 2 and has a predicted folding pattern which is very 
similar to the 5'-cloverleaf structure. One stem-loop of this second cloverleaf 
is almost identical to the 3CDpro-binding domain of rhinoviral 5'-cloverleafs. 
It was also demonstrated that the IRES elements and the 3'-NTRs of both, 
enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, have group-specific features which differ 
significantly from the corresponding genome regions of BEV. These results 
suggest that bovine enteroviruses hold an exceptional taxonomic position besides 
the established genera Enterovirus and Rhinovirus. Within the Enterovirus and 
Rhinovirus genera, the existence of virus clusters representing subgenera was 
previously proposed. Whereas the 5'-NTRs of the four human enterovirus clusters 
fall into two groups, all four clusters have characteristic secondary structures 
at the 3'-NTR supporting the concept of enterovirus clusters. For rhinoviruses, 
the existence of two virus clusters was confirmed.

Goatpox virus (GTPV), a member of the Capripoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae 
family, is the causative agent of variolo caprina (goatpox). GTPV can cause 
significant economic losses of domestic ruminants in endemic regions and can 
threaten breeding stocks. In this study, we report on the compilation of the 
complete genomic sequence of an isolated GTPV field strain FZ (GTPV_FZ). The 
150,194bp GTPV genome consists of a central coding region bounded by two 
identical 2301bp inverted terminal repeats and contains 151 putative genes. 
Comparative genomic analysis reveals the apparent genetic relationships among 
Capripoxviruses are close, but sufficient genomic variants in the field isolate 
strain FZ have been identified to distinguish it from other GTPV strains and 
other Capripoxvirus species. Phylogenetic analysis based on the p32 and complete 
GTPV genome can be used to differentiate SPPVs, GTPVs and LSDVs. These data may 
contribute to the epidemiological study of the Chinese capripoxvirus and help to 
develop more specific detection methods to distinguish GTPVs, SPPVs and LSDVs.

In this study, we found a much higher proportion of reticuloendotheliosis virus 
(REV) infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were in active cell division 
phase than that of control cells which indicated that REV can affect the fate of 
CEF. So, we performed high-throughput sequencing and transcriptomic analysis to 
identify functional miRNAs, in order to figure out the possible mechanism in the 
interaction of REV with CEF. In total, 50 differentially expressed miRNAs 
(DEmiRNAs) were identified. Then target genes of DEmiRNAs were predicted and 
identified by transcriptome profile results. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) enrichment were conducted to analyze the identified target genes 
of miRNAs which showed that metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis were the most 
related pathways involved in infection of REV. We analyzed the genes related to 
cell cycle which indicated that CyclinD1-CDK6 complex played an important role 
in regulating the transition of the cell cycle from G1 phase to S phase during 
REV infection. Fluorescence microscope identification showed that REV inhibited 
the apoptosis of CEF which was in accordance with transcriptome results. A novel 
miRNA, named novel-72 was found, KEGG analysis was conducted to predict the 
biological function of its target genes which showed that those target genes 
were significantly enriched in mTOR signaling pathway and functioned to promote 
cell cycle and cell growth during the REV infection. In conclusion, REV could 
induce the up-regulation of cell metabolism, cell cycle and mTOR signaling 
pathway while inhibit apoptosis of the cell.

Viral metagenomics analysis demonstrates the diversity of viral flora in piglet diarrhoeic faeces in China,"<jats:p>To investigate the diversity of viral flora, we used metagenomics to study the viral communities in a pooled faecal sample of 27 diarrhoeic piglets from intensive commercial farms in China. The 15 distinct mammalian viruses identified in the pooled diarrhoeic sample were, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, <jats:italic>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</jats:italic> (PEDV), sapovirus, porcine bocavirus-4 (PBoV-4), sapelovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, PBoV-2, stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus (poSCV), astrovirus (AstV), kobuvirus, posavirus-1, porcine enterovirus-9 (PEV-9), porcine circovirus-like (po-circo-like) virus, picobirnavirus (PBV) and <jats:italic>Torque teno sus virus 2</jats:italic> (TTSuV-2). The prevalence rate of each virus was verified from diarrhoeic and healthy piglets by PCR assay. A mean of 5.5 different viruses were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact co-infected with 11 different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets. Furthermore, we report here for the first time the presence of several recently described viruses in China, and the identification of novel genotypes. Therefore, our investigation results provide an unbiased survey of viral communities and prevalence in faecal samples of piglets.</jats:p>",0

Bovine enteroviruses, which belong to the Picornaviridae family, can cause 
clinical symptoms in cattle and are excreted in feces. In this study, a 
cytolytic virus was isolated from Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells from 
fecal samples of bovine with severe diarrhea and hemorrhagic intestinal mucosa 
that had been originally diagnosed with bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) by a bovine 
viral diarrhea virus Ag point-of-care test (IDEXX, American). Random priming PCR 
was used to amplify underlying viral sequences and identify the isolated virus. 
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolated virus closely matches the 
EV-E2 species, which is different from other Chinese strains previously 
isolated. The newly identified virus was named HLJ-3531/2013. We infected the 
sulking mice with the isolated virus. Reverse-transcription PCR, hematoxylin and 
eosin (HE) staining, serum neutralization (SN) test, and virus isolation from 
various tissues revealed that HLJ-3531/2013 can infect the intestine, liver, and 
lung of suckling mice. The present work is the first to report the reproduction 
of clinical symptoms by an isolated virus in an experimental infection model of 
animals and lays a solid foundation for the development of the pathogenesis of 
bovine enteroviruses.

PEDV remains one of the most important swine diseases that infects pigs of all 
ages. It causes devastating viral enteric disease in piglets with a high 
mortality rate, leading to significant threats and huge economic loss to the 
pork industry. In this study, a transcriptomic shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) 
procedure was used to study gene responses against PEDV infection. Genome-wide 
analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed in Vero E6 cells 
post-PEDV infection. mTOR signaling pathway activator-MHY1485, and 
inhibitor-PP242 were used to study the antiviral function. Results revealed that 
the IRF3 was significantly up-regulated post-PEDV infection. Although most of 
the IFN-regulatory and -related genes evaluated in this study were either 
down-regulated or remained unchanged, IL11 behaved significantly up-regulated, 
with the peak at 16 hpi. Nearly 90% of PEDV infections were suppressed in the 
PP242 pretreated cells whereas the reverse effect was observed in the MYH1485 
pretreated cells. Results indicated that the mTOR signaling pathway played a 
vital role in the PEDV antiviral regulation in the Vero E6 cells. Future studies 
will contribute to better understand the cellular antiviral mechanism against 
PEDV.

All four PoBoV species were detected in the 166 samples collected in 2010 from swine herds located in ten provinces of China. The detection rates for PoBoV1-4 were 28·9%, 6·6%, 19·3% and 39·7%, respectively. The co-infection combinations involving these six porcine bocaviruses in the collected samples were very complex. Furthermore, mixed infections with viruses from other families (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, classic swine fever virus and porcine circovirus type 2) were also detected.</jats:p>",0

The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a highly diverse group of related 
arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock 
species. Cat Que virus (CQV), a Simbu serogroup virus of the genus 
Orthobunyavirus (family Bunyaviridae), was first isolated in 2004 from 
mosquitoes during surveillance of arbovirus activity in acute pediatric 
encephalitis in northern Vietnam. We report here the complete genome sequence of 
SC0806 isolated from mosquitoes (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) in Sichuan Province, 
China. Consistent with the genomic organization of Simbu serogroup viruses, the 
SC0806 genome comprises three RNA segments-a large (L) segment (6928 
nucleotides) that encodes the 2261-amino-acid RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a 
medium (M) segment (4481 nucleotides) that encodes the 1433-amino-acid 
polyprotein, and a small (S) segment (984 nucleotides) that encodes a 
234-amino-acid nucleocapsid protein and a 95-amino-acid nonstructural protein. 
The respective lengths of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and 3'-UTR of L, M, 
and S are 56 and 86, 43 and 136, and 44 and 238 nucleotides. Sequence 
(nucleotide and deduced amino acid) comparison and phylogenetic analysis 
revealed that SC0806 was closely related to the reported Vietnam isolate CQV. 
This is the first time that CQV has been isolated in Sichuan Province, China. 
Anti-SC0806 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies were found in pigs reared 
locally, indicating that CQV has formed a natural cycle in the local area. 
Surveillance of the distribution and pathogenicity of SC0806 should be 
strengthened.

High-throughput whole genome sequencing of <i>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus</i> from cell culture materials and clinical specimens using next-generation sequencing technology,"<jats:p> Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have increasingly played crucial roles in biological and medical research, but are not yet in routine use in veterinary diagnostic laboratories. We developed and applied a procedure for high-throughput RNA sequencing of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from cell culture–derived isolates and clinical specimens. Ten PRRSV isolates with known sequence information, 2 mixtures each with 2 different PRRSV isolates, and 51 clinical specimens (19 sera, 16 lungs, and 16 oral fluids) with various PCR threshold cycle (Ct) values were subjected to nucleic acid extraction, cDNA library preparation (24-plexed), and sequencing. Whole genome sequences were obtained from 10 reference isolates with expected sequences and from sera with a PRRSV real-time reverse transcription PCR Ct ≤ 23.6, lung tissues with Ct ≤ 21, and oral fluids with Ct ≤ 20.6. For mixtures with PRRSV-1 and -2 isolates (57.8% nucleotide identity), NGS was able to distinguish them as well as obtain their respective genome sequences. For mixtures with 2 PRRSV-2 isolates (92.4% nucleotide identity), sequence reads with nucleotide ambiguity at numerous sites were observed, indicating mixed infection; however, individual virus sequences could only be separated when 1 isolate identity and sequence in the mixture is known. The NGS approach described herein offers the prospect of high-throughput sequencing and could be adapted to routine workflows in veterinary diagnostic laboratories, although further improvement of sequencing outcomes from clinical specimens with higher Ct values remains to be investigated. </jats:p>",0

Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4), a member of the Aviadenovirus genus of the 
Adenoviridae family, causes hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) in 
chickens. It causes mortality of up to 80% in 3-6-week-old broilers, posing a 
substantial threat to the poultry industry. However, the specific host responses 
to the virus are not well understood. To better understand the interactions 
between the host and FAdV-4 and to explore the pathogenesis of this virus, a 
high-throughput RNA-seq technology was utilized with leghorn male hepatocellular 
(LMH) cells at 12, 24, and 48 h after FAdV-4 infection. We identified a total of 
7000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were enriched in a variety of 
biological processes and pathways using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Several 
immune related pathways, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway 
and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, were activated after the 
FAdV-4 infection. The transcriptional data were validated by quantitative 
real-time PCR. The expression profiles of 10 genes involved in FAdV-4-infected 
chicken livers, including TLR2A, TLR3, TLR5, MyD88, IL12B, IL15, IL18, CCL20, 
TNFRSF21, and CD30, were consistent with RNA-seq profiles. By transfecting small 
interfering RNA into LMH cells, our results confirmed that MyD88 mediated 
FAdV-4-induced inflammation. To our knowledge, this was the first study to use 
transcriptome analysis to investigate host responses to FAdV-4 infection. These 
findings provide insights into the mechanisms of FAdV-4 pathogenesis and 
host-FAdV-4 interaction.

Orf virus, which belongs to the Parapoxvirus genus, induces a zoonotic 
infectious disease characterized by acute, highly vascularized cutaneous 
pustular lesions in sheep and goats. A number of Orf outbreaks have been 
reported in sheep and goats in recent years, but no reports have described an 
Orf virus strain from humans in China. In this study, we diagnosed Orf virus 
infection in two people, a mother and son, in the Gansu province of China. The 
human Orf virus was isolated and its phylogenetic characterization was analyzed 
based on a complete B2L gene. The results are useful for developing prospective 
programs to control Orf virus infections in both goats and humans.

The alterations of MicroRNAs(miRNAs) in host cell after foot-and-mouth disease 
virus (FMDV) infection is still obscure. To increase our understanding of the 
pathogenesis of FMDV at the post-transcriptional regulation level, Solexa 
high-throu MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role both in the 
post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and host-virus interactions. 
Despite investigations of miRNA expression ghput sequencing and bioinformatic 
tools were used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and analyze their 
functions during FMDV infection of PK-15 cells. Results indicated that 9,165,674 
and 9,230,378 clean reads were obtained, with 172 known and 72 novel miRNAs 
differently expressed in infected and uninfected groups respectively. Some of 
differently expressed miRNAs were validated using stem-loop real-time 
quantitative RT-PCR. The GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis for target 
genes revealed that differently expressed miRNAs were involved in immune 
response and cell death pathways.

Hepatitis E is an important public health concern throughout the world. Many 
molecular and serological surveys have reported the prevalence and genotypic 
characteristics of HEV in humans and animals worldwide. However, the genotypic 
characterization of this virus is very limited in Tibetan pigs. Hence, we aimed 
to explore the genotype of HEV, prevailing among Tibetan pigs in China. For this 
purpose, 253 bile samples of Tibetan pigs (free-range animals) were collected 
from different slaughterhouses during 2017-2018 and subsequently tested for HEV 
RNA by RT-nPCR. A total of 11 out of 253 (4.35%) samples tested were positive 
for HEV RNA. Based on the sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, all the 
isolated HEV strains belonged to genotype 4 and clustered into subtype 4b by 
sharing more than 84.8-95.2% identities with other reported strains. Our results 
concluded that HEV genotype 4 is prevailing among Tibetan pigs in Tibet, China.

Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the primary cause of post-weaning 
multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and other PCV-associated diseases. 
According to our previous RNA-sequencing analysis, the differences in the 
susceptibility to PCV2 infection depended on the genetic differences between the 
Laiwu (LW) and Yorkshire × Landrace crossbred (YL) pigs, but the cellular 
microRNA (miRNA) that are differentially expressed between the LW and YL pigs 
before and after PCV2 infection remain to be determined. In this study, 
high-throughput sequencing was performed to determine the abundance and 
differential expression of miRNA in lung tissues from PCV2-infected and 
PCV2-uninfected LW and YL pigs. In total, 295 known and 95 novel miRNA were 
identified, and 23 known and 25 novel miRNA were significantly differentially 
expressed in the PCV2-infected vs. PCV2-uninfected LW pigs and/or the 
PCV2-infected vs. PCV2-uninfected YL pigs. The expression levels of ssc-miR-122, 
ssc-miR-192, ssc-miR-451, ssc-miR-486, and ssc-miR-504 were confirmed by 
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Analysis of the potential targets of the 
four up-regulated miRNA (i.e., ssc-miR-122, ssc-miR-192, ssc-miR-451 and 
ssc-miR-486) identified pathways and genes that may be important for disease 
resistance. Among the up-regulated miRNA, ssc-miR-122 can repress the protein 
expression and viral DNA replication of PCV2 and down-regulate the expression of 
the nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) and aminopeptidase puromycin 
sensitive (NPEPPS) by binding to their 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) in PK15 
cells. Therefore, ssc-miR-122 may indirectly suppress PCV2 infection by 
targeting genes related to the host immune system, such as NFAT5 and NPEPPS.

Bovine mastitis is one of the most costly diseases in dairy cows worldwide. It 
can be caused by over 150 different microorganisms, where Staphylococcus aureus 
is the most frequently isolated and a major pathogen responsible for heavy 
economic losses in dairy industry. Although antibiotic therapy is most widely 
used, alternative treatments are necessary due to the increasing antibiotic 
resistance. Using phage for pathogen control is a promising tool in the fight 
against antibiotic resistance. Mainly using high-throughput sequencing, 
bioinformatics and our proposed phage termini identification method, we have 
isolated and characterized a novel virulent phage, designated as vB_SauS_IMEP5, 
from manure collected from dairy farms in Shihezi, Xinjiang, China, for use as a 
biocontrol agent against Staphylococcus aureus infections. Its latent period was 
about 30 min and its burst size was approximately 272PFU/cell. Phage 
vB_SauS_IMEP5 survives in a wide pH range between 3 and 12. A treatment at 70 °C 
for 20 min can inactive the phage. Morphological analysis of vB_SauS_IMEP5 
revealed that phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 morphologically resembles phages in the family 
Siphoviridae. Among our tested multiplicity of infections (MOIs), the optimal 
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of this phage was determined to be 0.001, 
suggesting that phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 has high bacteriolytic potential and good 
efficiency for reducing bacterial growth. The complete genome of IME-P5 is a 
44,677-bp, linear, double-stranded DNA, with a G+C content of 34.26%, containing 
69 putative ORFs. The termini of genome were determined with next-generation 
sequencing data using our previously proposed termini identification method, 
which suggests that this phage has non-redundant termini with 9nt 3' protruding 
cohesive ends. The genomic and proteomic characteristics of IMEP5 demonstrate 
that this phage does not belong to any of the previously recognized Siphoviridae 
Staphylococcus phage groups, suggesting the creation of a new lineage, thus 
adding to the knowledge on the diversity of Staphylococcus phages. An 
N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase gene and several conserved genes were 
predicted, while no virulence or antibiotic resistance genes were identified. 
This study isolated and characterized a novel S. aureus phage vB_SauS_IMEP5, and 
our findings suggest that this phage may be potentially utilized as a 
therapeutic or prophylactic candidate against S.aureus infections.

Two velogenic Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) obtained from outbreaks in 
domestic ducks in China were characterized in this study. Phylogenetic analysis 
revealed that both strains clustered with the class II viruses, with one 
phylogenetically close to the genotype VII NDVs and the other closer to genotype 
IX. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion (F) 
protein confirmed that both isolates contained the virulent motif 
(112)RRQK/RRF(117) at the cleavage site. The two NDVs had severe pathogenicity 
in fully susceptible chickens, resulting in 100% mortality. One of the isolates 
also demonstrated some pathogenicity in domestic ducks. The present study 
suggests that more than one genotype of NDV circulates in domestic ducks in 
China and viral transmission may occur among chickens and domestic ducks.

A serologic and virologic survey was performed to determine the prevalence and 
distribution of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection in Chinese duck flocks. 
NDV infection was detected in nine of the 12 sampled farms throughout the two 
geographic regions covered by the survey. The percentage antibody positivity 
among the 406 serum samples was 35.7%. Three velogenic NDVs were obtained from 
different duck flocks identified by hemagglutination and 
hemagglutination-inhibition tests, a pathogenicity test, and reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction on the fusion (F) genes. Phylogenetic 
analysis revealed that all three isolates clustered with the class II viruses; 
two were phylogenetically close to genotype VII NDVs, and the other was more 
closely related to genotype IX NDVs. These findings suggest that NDV infections 
were prevalent, and at least two distinct virulent genotypes may be responsible 
for recent epidemics in Chinese duck flocks.

Transcript Profiling Identifies Early Response Genes against FMDV Infection in PK-15 Cells,"<jats:p>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease that results in enormous economic loses worldwide. Although the protection provided by vaccination is limited during early infection, it is recognized as the best method to prevent FMD outbreaks. Furthermore, the mechanism of host early responses against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection remains unclear. In our study, a pig kidney cell line (PK-15) was used as a cell model to reveal the mechanism of early pig responses to FMDV infection. Four non-treated control and four FMDV-treated PK-15 cells were sequenced with RNA-seq technology, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed. The results showed that 1212 DEGs were in the FMDV-infected PK-15 cells, including 914 up-regulated and 298 down-regulated genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were significantly enriched in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NOD-like receptor, toll-like receptor, NF-κB, and the chemokine signaling pathways. To verify the results of the DEGs, 30 immune-related DEGs (19 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated) were selected for Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) verification. The results showed that RT-qPCR-measured genes exhibited a similar pattern as the RNA-seq analyses. Based on bioinformatics analysis, during FMDV early infection, we found that a series of cytokines, such as interleukins (IL6), chemokines (CXCL2, CCL20 and CCL4), and transcription factors (ZFP36, FOS, NFKBIA, ZBTB3, ZNF503, ZNF283, dymeclin (DYM), and orthodenticle homeobox 1 (OTX1)) were involved in the battle between FMDV and the host. Combined with their features and functions, we propose inflammation as the main early mechanism by which the host responds to FMDV infection. These data provide an additional panel of candidate genes for deciphering the mechanisms of a host’s early response against FMDV infection.</jats:p>",0
Evolution and Variation of the H3 Gene of Influenza A Virus and Interaction among Hosts,"<jats:p>&lt;i&gt;Objective:&lt;/i&gt; Continual mutations to the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza A virus generate novel antigenic strains that cause annual epidemics. The aim of this study was to evaluate evolution tendency of the H3 gene in a long period of time. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; 1842 H3 HA1 nucleotide strains of different hosts were collected for analysis. A two-step clustering method was used to divide strains into groups, and then a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on cluster results. Evolution rate in lineages were future estimated. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Tree structure showed three lineages: horse/canine, human/swine and avian. As a single trunk, the human/swine lineage was mainly composed of human strains, and more big branches appeared in recent years. Tree topology showed no evidence that swine affected the main evolution tendency of human H3 strains. The evolution rate of H3 strains varied between lineages. We observed that the rate in the human lineage decreased from 3.2 substitutions/year before 1980 to 1.8 after 1997. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; We concluded that the variation of human H3 gene was associated with swine strains but independent of others, including bird strains. The evolution rate of human H3 strains seems to have decreased in recent years, while the reasons for the rate change need to be further explored.</jats:p>",0
Faecal virome of cats in an animal shelter,"<jats:p>We describe the metagenomics-derived feline enteric virome in the faeces of 25 cats from a single shelter in California. More than 90 % of the recognizable viral reads were related to mammalian viruses and the rest to bacterial viruses. Eight viral families were detected: <jats:italic>Astroviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Coronaviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Herpesviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Anelloviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Caliciviridae</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Picobirnaviridae</jats:italic>. Six previously known viruses were also identified: feline coronavirus type 1, felid herpes 1, feline calicivirus, feline norovirus, feline panleukopenia virus and picobirnavirus. Novel species of astroviruses and bocaviruses, and the first genome of a cyclovirus in a feline were characterized. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region from four highly divergent partial viral genomes in the order <jats:italic>Picornavirales</jats:italic> were sequenced. The detection of such a diverse collection of viruses shed within a single shelter suggested that such animals experience robust viral exposures. This study increases our understanding of the viral diversity in cats, facilitating future evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials.</jats:p>",0

We describe here the metagenomics-derived viral sequences detected in beef, 
pork, and chicken purchased from stores in San Francisco. In beef we detected 
four previously reported viruses (two parvoviruses belonging to different 
genera, an anellovirus, and one circovirus-like virus) and one novel bovine 
polyomavirus species (BPyV2-SF) whose closest relatives infect primates. 
Detection of porcine hokovirus in beef indicated that this parvovirus can infect 
both ungulate species. In pork we detected four known parvoviruses from three 
genera, an anellovirus, and pig circovirus 2. Chicken meat contained numerous 
gyrovirus sequences including those of chicken anemia virus and of a novel 
gyrovirus species (GyV7-SF). Our results provide an initial characterization of 
some of the viruses commonly found in US store-bought meats which included a 
diverse group of parvoviruses and viral families with small circular DNA 
genomes. Whether any of these viruses can infect humans will require testing 
human sera for specific antibodies.

Hepatitis E Virus Infection among Domestic Animals in Eastern China,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen of which several species of animal were reported as reservoirs. Antibodies to HEV and HEV RNA have been detected in some Chinese population and swine groups but few other domestic animals. In this study, to investigate the HEV prevalence, we tested sera from 788 pigs, 100 cows, 50 goats, 49 horses, 101 pet dogs, 105 chickens, 47 duck and 45 pigeons in eastern China for anti‐HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG). We also tested 50% of the swine sera, all of sera from the other domestic animals and 13 Shanghai human sera which were positive for anti‐HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) for HEV RNA using reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction. Our results indicated that 82.5% (222/269) of the sows, 53.9% (104/193) of the 4‐ to 6‐month‐old swine, 63.4% (168/265) of the 1‐ to 3‐month‐old swine, 55.7% (34/61) of the slaughterhouse swine, 24% (12/50) of the goats, 16.3% (8/49) of the horses, 17.8% (21/101) of the pet dogs, 6% (6/100) of the cows, 12.8% (6/47) of the ducks, 4.4% (2/45) of the pigeons and 1.9% (2/105) of the chickens exhibited positive for anti‐HEV IgG. Inhibition assay confirmed the infection with HEV or HEV‐like viruses in these domestic animals except pigeons and chickens. From the sera, we isolated 18 swine HEV strains, one horse HEV strain and two human HEV strains. Sequence analysis showed that the horse HEV isolate and one swine isolate belonged to genotype 3. The other isolates belonged to genotype 4. The two human isolates were phylogenetically closely related to eight of the swine isolates. In short, the presence of anti‐HEV antibody had been confirmed in several species of domestic animals in eastern China and HEV RNA has been identified in swine, human and horse. This suggested that the authorities should pay more attention to the prevalence of HEV in eastern China.</jats:p>",0

FelineAV621 is 2409 nt long with a G+C content of 56.67 %, including three open 
reading frames (ORFs). Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of 
the putative capsid protein (ORF1) indicated that FelineAV621 belonged to a 
novel anellovirus species inside a clade containing the seal anellovirus, canine 
TTVs, and porcine TTVs, but was distant from all the previous feline 
anelloviruses.

The complete nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes of 
human coronavirus (HCV) strain OC43 and bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) 
strain G95 were determined from single-stranded cDNA fragments generated by 
reverse transcription of virus-specific mRNAs and amplified by polymerase chain 
reaction. An open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides was identified as the 
putative HE gene by homology to the bovine coronavirus HE gene. This open 
reading frame encodes a protein of 424 amino acids with an estimated molecular 
weight of 47.7 kDa. Ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in 
the HE protein of HCV-OC43 while nine of them were present in BRCV-G95. Fourteen 
cysteine residues were conserved in the HE proteins of both viruses. Two 
hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus and the C-terminus may serve as signal 
peptide and transmembrane anchoring domain, respectively. The predicted HE 
protein of HCV-OC43 was 95% identical to the HEs of BRCV-G95 and other bovine 
coronaviruses, and 60% identical to the HEs of mouse hepatitis viruses. 
Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the HE genes of coronaviruses and influenza 
C virus have a common ancestral origin, and that bovine coronaviruses and 
HCV-OC43 are closely related.

human infections have almost disappeared in the past year. In a recent study, 
Shi et al. revealed that the usage of a bivalent H5/H7 vaccine successfully 
prevented chicken infections, and thus prevented, and nearly eliminated, human 
infections.

high-throughput sequencing technology as compared to uninfected controls. The 
results showed that 104 known miRNAs and 9 new miRNA candidates were 
differentially expressed in ST cells after JEV infection. We identified 396 
differentially expressed mRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis identified 435 known 
miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs and 94 novel miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs involving 
miRNAs inversely correlated with the expression of their predicted target mRNAs. 
The known miRNAs inversely correlated with their target genes were involved in 
the biological processes of immunity, cytokine production, inflammation, and 
apoptosis. Selected miRNA-mRNA interactions were validated by luciferase 
reporter assay. Overall, our findings indicate that miRNAs may play critical 
roles in the pathogenesis of JEV infection.

The sigmaC-encoding gene of two muscovy duck reovirus (DRV) S14 and C4 strains 
were cloned and completely sequenced. The open reading frame (ORF) comprised 810 
bp and encoded 269 amino acids with a predicated molecular mass of 29.5 kDa. 
Expressed sigmaC fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 strain could be 
detected by Western blotting under duck anti-reovirus polyclonal serum. There 
are two large gap insertions at the N-terminal part of the DRV sigmaC when 
necessary to optimize the alignment of the amino acid sequences of the DRV 
sigmaC had a heptapeptide repeat and leucine zipper patterns structurally 
related to ARV sigmaC. All DRVs grouped into one specified genogroup within 
Orthoreoviruses genus subgroup II. The degree of differences between the S14/C4 
and ARV was only 23-24%, and 21-22%, respectively, at both the nucleotide and 
deduced amino acid levels, suggested that DRVs are quite different from ARVs and 
should give a precise classification for DRVs in Orthoreovirus genus.

In 2013, the novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus was 
reported in China. Through enhanced surveillance, infection by the H7N9 virus in 
humans was first identified in Zhejiang Province. Real-time 
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the 
infection. Embryonated chicken eggs were used for virus isolation from 
pharyngeal swabs taken from infected human patients. The H7N9 isolates were 
first identified by the hemagglutination test and electron microscopy, then used 
for whole genome sequencing. Bioinformatics software was used to construct the 
phylogenetic tree and for computing the mean rate of evolution of the HA gene in 
H7Nx and NA in HxN9. Two novel H7N9 avian influenza A viruses (A/Zhejiang/1/2013 
and A/Zhejiang/2/2013) were isolated from the positive infection cases. 
Substitutions were found in both Zhejiang isolates and were identified as 
human-type viruses. All phylogenetic results indicated that the novel 
reassortant in H7N9 originated in viruses that infected birds. The sequencing 
and phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome revealed the mean rate of 
evolution of the HA gene in H7NX to be 5.74E-3 (95% Highest posterior density: 
3.8218E-3 to 7.7873E-3) while the NA gene showed 2.243E-3 (4.378E-4 to 3.79E-3) 
substitutions per nucleotide site per year. The novel reassortant H7N9 virus was 
confirmed by molecular methods to have originated in poultry, with the mutations 
occurring during the spread of the H7N9 virus infection. Live poultry markets 
played an important role in whole H7N9 circulation.

OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: Developing an effective HIV-1 vaccine that elicits 
broadly neutralizing HIV-1 human antibodies (bnAbs) remains a challenging goal. 
Extensive studies on HIV-1 have revealed various strategies employed by the 
virus to escape host immune surveillance. Here, we investigated the human 
antibody gene repertoires of uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals at 
genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels by deep sequencing followed by 
high-throughput sequence analysis to determine the frequencies of putative 
germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 monoclonal bnAbs (bnmAbs).
METHODS: Combinatorial gDNA and cDNA antibody libraries were constructed using 
the gDNAs and mRNAs isolated from uninfected and HIV-1-infected human peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All libraries were deep sequenced and sequences 
analysed using IMGT/HighV-QUEST software 
(http://imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/index.action). The frequencies of putative germline 
antibodies of known bnmAbs in the gDNA and cDNA libraries were determined.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The human gDNA antibody libraries were more diverse in 
heavy and light chain V-gene lineage usage than the cDNA libraries, indicating 
that the human gDNA antibody gene repertoires may have more potential than the 
cDNA repertoires to develop HIV-1 bnAbs. The frequencies of the heavy and kappa 
and lambda light chain variable regions with identical V(D)J recombinations to 
known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low in human antibody gene repertoires. 
However, we found relatively high frequencies of the heavy and kappa and lambda 
light chain variable regions that used the same V-genes and had the same CDR3 
lengths as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of (D)J-gene usage. B-cells bearing 
B-cell receptors of such heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions 
may be stimulated to induce HIV-1 bnAbs.

Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most important diseases of poultry, and 
causes severe economic losses in the global poultry industry. Although all 
Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates belong to a single serotype, significant 
genetic diversity has been described between different NDV isolates. Here, we 
report the molecular characterization of 23 virulent genotype VIId NDV isolates 
of class II circulating in China. Phylogenetic construction and analysis 
revealed the existence of distinctly genomic and amino acid differences that 
clearly distinguished these isolates from other typical NDV genotypes and 
vaccine strains. We also report a new 582-amino-acid hemagglutinin-neuraminidase 
in genotype VII NDV strains. This is believed to be the first study to 
investigate systematically the most predominant NDV strains, and provides more 
information on the genetic nature of genotype VIId NDV of class II circulating 
in China.

BACKGROUND: Tembusu virus (TMUV), classified in the genus Flavivirus, causes 
reduced egg production and neurological problems in poultry. Flavivirus 
replication depends on the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress 
that leads to activation of the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), an 
important signalling pathway that regulates many biological functions involved 
in viral pathogenesis and innate immunity. However, the mechanism of 
TMUV-induced UPR activation remains unclear.
RESULTS: In this study, we systematically investigated the three UPR pathways in 
TMUV-infected BHK-21 cells. Our results showed that expression of 
glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP94 was upregulated during the course 
of TMUV infection. We then demonstrated that TMUV activated the PERK pathway in 
the early stage of infection, resulting in upregulation of ATF4, GADD34 and 
CHOP, with CHOP induction leading to caspase-3 activation. We also found the 
IRE1 pathway to be activated, leading to splicing of X box binding protein 1 
(XBP1) mRNA and enhanced expression of p58IPK. Finally, we observed increased 
expression of ATF6 and activity of ER stress-response elements, suggesting 
stimulation of the ATF6 pathway. In addition, ATF6 pathway activation correlated 
with the induction of downstream chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57 and 
PDI. UPR activity was also observed by the marked elevation in GRP78 and sXBP1 
levels in TMUV-infected DF-1 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that TMUV infection-induced ER stress 
activates three branches of the UPR, and these results lay the foundation for 
elucidating the pathogenesis of TMUV and understanding the inherent mechanism of 
TMUV infection as well as the host response.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a significant zoonotic infectious disease. It 
has an important economic impact throughout the world. As well, it is a 
considerable threat to food security. At present, the molecular mechanism of 
FMDV infection is not clear to a large extent. Innate immune response is the 
first line of defense against infectious diseases. The systematic analysis of 
the host immune response to infection has an important role in understanding the 
pathogenesis of infection. However, there are few reports about effect of immune 
regulation on virus replication in the interaction of virus and host cellular. 
High-throughput RNA-seq technology as a powerful and efficient means for 
transcript analysis provides a new insight into FMDV study. In this study, RNA 
extracted from pig PBMCs infected with O subtype FMDV at 4 dpi. A total of 
29942658 and 31452917 Illumina read pairs were obtained from the non-infected 
(NI) group and infected (I) group, respectively. The clean bases for all samples 
are 3.61G (NI group) and 3.79G (I group), respectively. The clean reads of the 
NI and I group that mapped to pig genome data were 47195073 (81.82%) and 
46556714 (76.85%), respectively. Most of the clean reads were distributed in the 
exon region, followed by intron region and intergenic region. Differently 
expressed (DE) genes were analyzed using edgeR software. 451 genes were 
differentially expressed between the infected and the non-infected groups. 
According to the comparison analysis, more genes were down-regulated in the 
non-infected samples than in those infected with FMDV.66 out of 451 genes were 
down-regulated, 385 out of 451 genes were up-regulated following FMDV infection. 
For function classification and pathway analysis, among 17741 assembled 
unigenes, there are 349 genes which are different genes of GO notes. Moreover, 
49 genes were down-regulated, 300 genes were up-regulated associate with GO 
term. 1621 were successfully annotated by GO assignments, belonging to one or 
more of the three categories: biological process, cellular component, and 
molecular function. According to KEGG analysis,the main pathway was represented 
including protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, phagosome, cell cycle and 
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Some key DE genes related to immune 
process and signaling pathways were analyzed and quantified by RT-PCR. This is 
the first systematical transcriptome analysis of pig PBMCs infected by FMDV. 
These findings will help us better understand the host Cell-FMDV interaction and 
its relationship to pathogenesis, as well as contribute to the prevention and 
control of FMDV.

There is multiple evidence that swine may act as a vessel for the generation of 
novel influenza A viruses. In this study, we have analyzed the evolution and 
pathogenicity of one strain of H6N6 influenza virus isolated from swine with 
clinical signs of infection in China. Although phylogenetic analysis revealed 
that this virus might originate from domestic ducks, pathogenicity experiments 
indicated that the virus replicated in mice without prior adaptation. These 
findings suggest that the virus has transmitted from ducks to swine in China, 
and replicated in mammalian hosts without prior adaptation, which may pose a 
threat to both veterinary and public health.

To investigate whether the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus was still being 
transmitted in swine, a total of 1029 nasal swab samples from healthy swine were 
collected from January to May 2010 in Jiangsu province of China. Eight H1N1 
influenza viruses were isolated and identified, and their full length genomes 
were sequenced. We found that all eight of the H1N1 viruses shared higher than 
98.0% sequence identity with the 2009 pandemic virus A/Jiangsu/1/2009 (JS1). In 
addition, some of these viruses had D225G (3/8) mutations in the receptor 
binding sites of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, indicating enhancement of their 
binding affinity to the sialic α2, 3Gal receptor. In conclusion, the 2009 
pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus has retro-infected swine from humans in mainland 
China, and significant viral evolution is still ongoing in this species.

BACKGROUND: Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), a major etiopathologic cause of 
pediatric hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide, has been reported to 
have caused several fatalities. Revealing the evolutionary and epidemiologic 
dynamics of CV-A16 across time and space is central to understanding its 
outbreak potential.
METHODS: In this study, we isolated six CV-A16 strains in China's Jilin province 
and construct a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree for CV-A16 VP1 gene by the 
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method using 708 strains from GenBank with 
epidemiological information. The evolution characteristics of CV-A16 VP1 gene 
was also analysed dynamicly through Bayesian skyline plot.
RESULTS: All CV-A16 strains identified could be classified into five major 
genogroups, denoted by GI-GV. GIV and GV have co-circulated in China since 2007, 
and the CV-A16 epidemic strain isolated in the Jilin province, China, can be 
classified as GIV-3. The CV-A16 genogroups circulating recently in China have 
the same ancestor since 2007. The genetic diversity of the CV-A16 VP1 gene shows 
a continuous increase since the mid-1990s, with sharp increases in genetic 
diversity in 1997 and 2007 and reached peak in 2007. Very low genetic diversity 
existed after 2010. The CV-A16 VP1 gene evolutionary rate was 6.656E-3 
substitutions per site per year.
CONCLUSIONS: We predicted the dynamic phylogenetic trends, which indicate 
outbreak trends of CV-A16, and provide theoretical foundations for clinical 
prevention and treatment of HFMD which caused by a CV-A16.

Ducks play an important role in transmitting and maintaining mammalian viruses 
in nature, and are a reservoir host of many animal viruses. We analyzed the 
fecal virome of four strains (A, B, C, and D) of ducks living in isolation by 
using metagenomic analysis. The feces of the ducks tested contained 18 animal 
virus families. The percentage values of RNA virus reads, compared to the total 
animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% (A), 97.30% (B), 
98.01 (C), and 67.49% (D), and were mainly from Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, 
Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Reoviridae. Meanwhile, the minority of DNA 
virus reads were related to Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Iridoviridae, and 
other, low abundance viral families. The percentage values of Orthomyxoviridae, 
Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Herpesviridae reads were not 
significantly different among strains A, B, and C; however, there were marked 
differences in the abundance of these reads in strain D. In summary, this study 
provides an unbiased examination of the viral diversity in the feces of four 
strains of ducks in specific-pathogen-free periods, and highlights the variation 
in the percentage of viral families present. These results can be used as a 
reference for detecting duck viral pathogens and predicting zoonotic potential.

Avian nephritis virus (ANV), which belongs to the Astroviridae family, has been 
associated with acute nephritis in chickens. Cases of ANV infection have been 
recorded in Japan and in several European countries. However, related studies 
have never been performed in China. Thus, this study isolated ANV in Chinese 
chicken flocks. ANV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR in stool 
samples collected from healthy layer chickens in the Sichuan Province of China 
in 2009. Of the 192 stool specimens collected, 32.3% (62/192) were positive for 
ANV infection. The whole genome of ANV-Sichuan54, the first representative 
Chinese strain, was 6941 nucleotides in length, including the 5' untranslated 
region, three open reading frames (ORFs), a 3' UTR, and a poly-(A) tail. 
Comparative and phylogenetic analyses based on partial RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase (ORF1b) demonstrated that the majority of ANV investigations were 
more closely related to the U.S. ANV strain (DQ324827-324836) than to the G-4260 
(AB033998).

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in 
Asia and domestic pigs serve as the amplifying hosts. In the present study, the 
full genomic sequences of two JEV strains (HEN0701 and SH0601) isolated from 
pigs in China were determined and compared with other 12 JEV strains deposited 
in GenBank. These two strains had an 88.8% nucleotide sequence similarity and 
97.9% deduced amino acid sequence homology. HEN0701 had high nucleotide sequence 
and high amino acid sequence identity with genotype I (GI) strains, while SH0601 
had high nucleotide sequence and high amino acid sequence identity with GIII 
strains at both the gene and full genome levels. Further phylogenetic analysis 
showed that HEN0701 belonged to the JEV GI group and SH0601 was classified as a 
GIII strain. Analysis of codon usage showed there were a few differences between 
the GI and GIII strains in nucleotide composition and codon usage for the open 
reading frames.

Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) was detected in Shandong, China. One hundred 
and thirty-two of 222 (59.46%) samples were PCV3 positive, while 52 of 132 
(39.39%) samples were co-infected with PCV2. There were no clinical signs of 
infection in either multiparous sows or live-born infants. Two strains of PCV3 
were indentified from natural stillborn foetuses. Phylogenetic analysis showed 
the two strains of PCV3 are 96% identical to the known PCV3/Pig/USA (KX778720.1, 
KX966193.1 and KX898030.1) and closely related to Barbel Circovirus. Further 
studies of the epidemiology of PCV3 and the co-infection with PCV2 are needed.

Whole blood samples (472) were collected during the period of 2006-2008 from 15 
cattle farms in seven districts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which 
is a major pastoral area and represents 1/6 of Chinese territory. Bovine viral 
diarrhea virus (BVDV) was detected by nested reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction assay (RT-nPCR) and sequenced within the 5'-untranslated region 
of the genome. Approximately 43% (202 samples) were BVDV-positive. Of the 
positive samples, 24 were chosen for further sequencing, sequence comparisons, 
and phylogenetic reconstructions. The phylogenetic reconstructions demonstrated 
that these isolates clustered into either BVDV1b (18 samples) or BVDV1c (six 
samples) subgenotypes. None of the isolates sequenced showed any cytopathic 
effect in culture. Unlike previously published studies in Chinese cattle, no 
BVDV2 genotypes were detected. These results indicate that the predominant 
subgenotypes in Xinjiang are BVDV1b and BVDV1c. This finding can be useful for 
further BVDV epidemiological study in China.

Single-Reaction Genomic Amplification Accelerates Sequencing and Vaccine Production for Classical and Swine Origin Human Influenza A Viruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Pandemic influenza A viruses that emerge from animal reservoirs are inevitable. Therefore, rapid genomic analysis and creation of vaccines are vital. We developed a multisegment reverse transcription-PCR (M-RTPCR) approach that simultaneously amplifies eight genomic RNA segments, irrespective of virus subtype. M-RTPCR amplicons can be used for high-throughput sequencing and/or cloned into modified reverse-genetics plasmids via regions of sequence identity. We used these procedures to rescue a contemporary H3N2 virus and a swine origin H1N1 virus directly from human swab specimens. Together, M-RTPCR and the modified reverse-genetics plasmids that we designed streamline the creation of vaccine seed stocks (9 to 12 days).</jats:p>",0

Unlike traditional virus isolation and sequencing approaches, 
sequence-independent amplification based viral metagenomics technique allows one 
to discover unexpected or novel viruses efficiently while bypassing culturing 
step. Here we report the discovery of the first Sicinivirus isolate (designated 
as strain JSY) of picornaviruses from commercial layer chickens in mainland 
China by using a viral metagenomics technique. This Sicinivirus isolate, which 
contains a whole genome of 9,797 nucleotides (nt) excluding the poly(A) tail, 
possesses one of the largest picornavirus genome so far reported, but only 
shares 88.83% and 82.78% of amino acid sequence identity to that of ChPV1 100C 
(KF979332) and Sicinivirus 1 strain UCC001 (NC_023861), respectively. The 
complete 939 nt 5'UTR of the isolate strain contains at least twelve stem-loop 
domains (A-L), representing the highest set of loops reported within Sicinivirus 
genus. The conserved 'barbell-like' structure was also present in the 272 nt 
3'UTR of the isolate as that in the 3' UTR of Sicinivirus 1 strain UCC001. The 
8,586 nt large open reading frame encodes a 2,862 amino acids polyprotein 
precursor. Moreover, Sicinivirus infection might be widely present in commercial 
chicken farms in Yancheng region of the Jiangsu Province as evidenced by all the 
tested stool samples from three different farms being positive (17/17) for 
Sicinivirus detection. This is the first report on identification of Sicinivirus 
in commercial layer chickens with a severe clinical disease in mainland China, 
however, further studies are needed to evaluate the pathogenic potential of this 
picornavirus in chickens.

The mechanism of utilization of alternative two AUGs in foot-and-mouth disease 
virus (FMDV) is still unknown to date. In this study, the characteristics of 
codon usage bias (CUB) of the region between the two AUGs (the region-La) and of 
the same-sized region behind the second AUG (the region-Lb) in 94 different FMDV 
RNA sequences were analyzed using relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values. 
The results indicated that many codons with negative CUB were preferentially 
used in the region-La. There were two conserved residues (Thr and Cys) on the 
4th and 6th residue positions of the region-La. The conserved residues had a 
general tendency to choose synonymous codons with negative CUB. Although most 
positions in the region-La did not contain conserved residues, many positions 
tended to use codons with negative CUB in this region. Among these codons, the 
majority belonged to the amino acids containing synonymous codons with clearly 
positive and negative CUB, including Asp, Val, Ile, Leu, Thr, Ala, Ser, Asn and 
Arg. The presence of many codons with negative CUB in the region-La might impair 
the efficiency of the first AUG selection. The phylogenetic incongruence of the 
region-La and the region-Lb implied that intertypic recombination played an 
important role in the evolution of FMDV. Furthermore, due to the existence of 
more positions with positive CUB and more widespread phylogenetic incongruence 
in the region-Lb than the region-La, a probable relationship between the degree 
of CUB and the evolution of the two target regions was revealed.

Global pairwise RNA interaction landscapes reveal core features of protein recognition,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>RNA–protein interactions permeate biology. Transcription, translation, and splicing all hinge on the recognition of structured RNA elements by RNA-binding proteins. Models of RNA–protein interactions are generally limited to short linear motifs and structures because of the vast sequence sampling required to access longer elements. Here, we develop an integrated approach that calculates global pairwise interaction scores from in vitro selection and high-throughput sequencing. We examine four RNA-binding proteins of phage, viral, and human origin. Our approach reveals regulatory motifs, discriminates between regulated and non-regulated RNAs within their native genomic context, and correctly predicts the consequence of mutational events on binding activity. We design binding elements that improve binding activity in cells and infer mutational pathways that reveal permissive versus disruptive evolutionary trajectories between regulated motifs. These coupling landscapes are broadly applicable for the discovery and characterization of protein–RNA recognition at single nucleotide resolution.</jats:p>",0

Enteric viral infections in pigs may cause diarrhea resulting in ill-thrift and 
substantial economic losses. This study reports the enteric infections with 
porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV4), porcine group A rotavirus (GARV), porcine 
group C rotavirus (GCRV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine kobuvirus 
(PKoV) in 419 pigs, comprising both healthy and diarrheic animals, from 49 farms 
in five European countries (Austria, Germany, Hungary, Spain and Sweden). 
Real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to test fecal samples and to compare the 
prevalence and viral load in relation to health status, farms of origin and age 
groups. The results showed that PAstV4 (70.4%) was the dominant virus species, 
followed by PKoV (56.7%), PCV2 (42.2%), GCRV (3%) and GARV (0.9%). Diarrheic 
pigs had a higher viral load of PAstV4 in the nursery and growing-finishing 
groups. Rotaviruses were mainly detected in diarrheic pigs, whereas PCV2 was 
more often detected in clinically healthy than in diarrheic pigs, suggesting 
that most PCV2 infections were subclinical. PAstV4, PCV2 and PKoV were 
considered ubiquitous in the European pig livestock and co-infections among them 
were frequent, independently of the disease status, in contrast to a low 
prevalence of classical rotavirus infections.

Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRS), caused by PRRS virus 
(PRRSV), is one of the most serious infectious diseases in the swine industry 
worldwide. Indigenous Chinese Tongcheng (TC) pigs reportedly show strong 
resistance to PRRSV infection. The miRNA expression profiles of porcine alveolar 
macrophages (PAMs) of control TC pigs and those infected with PRRSV in vivo were 
analyzed by high-throughput sequencing to explore changes induced by infection. 
A total of 182 known miRNAs including 101 miRNA-5p and 81 miRNA-3p were 
identified with 23 up-regulated differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 
25 down-regulated DEmiRNAs. Gene Ontology analysis showed that predicted target 
genes for the DEmiRNAs were enriched in immune response, transcription 
regulation, and cell death. The integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA 
expression revealed that down-regulated methylation-related genes (DNMT1 and 
DNMT3b) were targeted by five up-regulated DEmiRNAs. Furthermore, 35 pairs of 
miRNAs (70 miRNAs) were co-expressed after PRRSV infection and six pairs were 
co-expressed differently. Our results describe miRNA expression profiles of TC 
pigs in response to PRRSV infection and lay a strong foundation for developing 
novel therapies to control PRRS in pigs.

The family Circoviridae comprises a large group of small circular 
single-stranded DNA viruses with several members causing severe pig and poultry 
diseases. In recent years the number of new viruses within the family has had an 
explosive increase showing a high level of genetic diversity and a broad host 
range. In this report we describe two more circoviruses identified from bats in 
Yunnan and Heilongjiang provinces in China. Full genome sequencing has revealed 
that these bat associated circoviruses (bat ACV) should be classified as new 
species within the genus Circovirus based on the demarcation criteria of the 
International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The most striking 
result is the novel finding of a 21-28 nt polythymidine (poly-T) tract in the 3' 
terminal intergenic region of bat ACV isolates from Heilongjiang province. To 
understand its role in viral replication, a wild type bat ACV and a mutated 
version with the entire poly-T deleted were rescued through construction of 
infectious clones. Replication comparison in vitro showed that the poly-T is not 
essential for viral replication. Identification of additional bat ACV isolates 
and study of their biological characteristics will be the main task in future to 
understand the potential roles of bats in transmission of circoviruses to 
terrestrial mammals and humans.

BACKGROUND: Riemerella anatipestifer infection is a contagious disease that has 
resulted in major economic losses in the duck industry worldwide. This study 
attempted to characterize CRISPR-Cas systems in the disease-causing agent, 
Riemerella anatipestifer (R. anatipestifer). The CRISPR-Cas system provides 
adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements in prokaryotes and CRISPR-cas 
loci extensively exist in the genomes of archaea and bacteria. However, the 
structure characteristics of R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems remains to be 
elucidated due to the limited availability of genomic data.
RESULTS: To identify the structure and components associated with CRISPR-Cas 
systems in R. anatipestifer, we performed comparative genomic analysis of 
CRISPR-Cas systems in 25 R. anatipestifer strains using high-throughput 
sequencing. The results showed that most of the R. anatipestifer strains (20/25) 
that were analyzed have two CRISPR loci (CRISPR1 and CRISPR2). CRISPR1 was shown 
to be flanked on one side by cas genes, while CRISPR2 was designated as an 
orphan. The other analyzed strains harbored only one locus, either CRISPR1 or 
CRISPR2. The length and content of consensus direct repeat sequences, as well as 
the length of spacer sequences associated with the two loci, differed from each 
other. Only three cas genes (cas1, cas2 and cas9) were located upstream of 
CRISPR1. CRISPR1 was also shown to be flanked by a 107 bp-long putative leader 
sequence and a 16 nt-long anti-repeat sequence. Combined with analysis of spacer 
organization similarity and phylogenetic tree of the R. anatipestifer strains, 
CRISPR arrays can be divided into different subgroups. The diversity of spacer 
organization was observed in the same subgroup. In general, spacer organization 
in CRISPR1 was more divergent than that in CRISPR2. Additionally, only 8 % of 
spacers (13/153) were homologous with phage or plasmid sequences. The cas operon 
flanking CRISPR1 was observed to be relatively conserved based on multiple 
sequence alignments of Cas amino acid sequences. The phylogenetic analysis 
associated with Cas9 showed Cas9 sequence from R. anatipestifer was closely 
related to that of Bacteroides fragilis and formed part of the subtype II-C 
subcluster.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed for the first time the structural features of R. 
anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems. The illumination of structural features of 
CRISPR-Cas system may assist in studying the specific mechanism associated with 
CRISPR-mediated adaptive immunity and other biological functions in R. 
anatipestifer.

Origins and Evolutionary Dynamics of H3N2 Canine Influenza Virus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are maintained mainly in wild birds, and despite frequent spillover infections of avian IAVs into mammals, only a small number of viruses have become established in mammalian hosts. A new H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations of China and South Korea, and possibly in Thailand. The emergence of CIV provides new opportunities for zoonotic infections and interspecies transmission. We examined 14,764 complete IAV genomes together with all CIV genomes publicly available since its first isolation until 2013. We show that CIV may have originated as early as 1999 as a result of segment reassortment among Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages. We also identified amino acid changes that might have played a role in CIV emergence, some of which have not been previously identified in other cross-species jumps. CIV evolves at a lower rate than H3N2 human influenza viruses do, and viral phylogenies exhibit geographical structure compatible with high levels of local transmission. We detected multiple intrasubtypic and heterosubtypic reassortment events, including the acquisition of the NS segment of an H5N1 avian influenza virus that had previously been overlooked. In sum, our results provide insight into the adaptive changes required by avian viruses to establish themselves in mammals and also highlight the potential role of dogs to act as intermediate hosts in which viruses with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential could originate, particularly with an estimated dog population of ∼700 million.</jats:p>

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Influenza A viruses circulate in humans and animals. This multihost ecology has important implications, as past pandemics were caused by IAVs carrying gene segments of both human and animal origin. Adaptive evolution is central to cross-species jumps, and this is why understanding the evolutionary processes that shape influenza A virus genomes is key to elucidating the mechanisms underpinning viral emergence. An avian-origin canine influenza virus (CIV) has recently emerged in dogs and is spreading in Asia. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of CIV and show that it originated from both Eurasian and North American avian lineages. We also identified the mutations that might have been responsible for the cross-species jump. Finally, we provide evidence of multiple reassortment events between CIV and other influenza viruses (including an H5N1 avian virus). This is a cause for concern, as there is a large global dog population to which humans are highly exposed.

House sparrow (Passer domesticus) is one of the most widely distributed wild 
birds in China. Five Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains were isolated from 
house sparrows living around the poultry farms in southern China. These isolates 
were characterized by pathogenic assays and phylogenetic analysis. The results 
showed that all NDV isolates except one were velogenic and virulent for 
chickens. These four virulent strains for chickens possess the amino acid 
sequence (112)R/K-R-Q-K/R-R-F(117) in the F(0) cleavage site which is typical of 
velogenic NDV. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these isolates belong to 
genotype VII and were closely related to the strains which were isolated from 
NDV outbreaks in chickens since 2000. One isolate of NDV from house sparrow 
belong to genotype II and was proved to be vaccine strain 
(Chicken/U.S./LaSota/46). The result of this study proved that house sparrow can 
carry the virulent NDV strains and the same genotype of viruses that are 
circulating in poultry are existing in house sparrows living around poultry farm 
in southern China.

More than 40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been approved for a number of 
disease indications with only one of these (Synagis) - for a viral disease, and 
not for therapy but for prevention. However, in the last decade novel potent 
mAbs have been discovered and characterized with potential as therapeutics 
against viruses of major importance for public health and biosecurity including 
Hendra virus (HeV), Nipah virus (NiV), severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), West Nile virus (WNV), influenza 
virus (IFV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Here, we review 
such mAbs with an emphasis on antibodies of human origin, and highlight recent 
results as well as technologies and mechanisms related to their potential as 
therapeutics.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in China and is predominantly due to 
foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O Mya-98 lineage. In recent years, 
FMDV O/ME-SA/Ind2001 lineage has spread from the Indian subcontinent to 
South-East Asia, Middle East and Africa, which may pose potential threats for 
future trans-regional livestock movements. In this study, we identified the 
appearance of FMDV O/ME-SA/Ind2001 in China; the first time that this virus 
lineage has been found there. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of VP1 
sequences revealed that this newly determined strain belongs to O/ME-SA/Ind2001 
sublineage d and is closely related to strains that have caused recent outbreaks 
of FMD in Nepal, Myanmar, Russia and South Korea. The results suggest extensive 
movements of the current O/ME-SA/Ind2001 sublineage d viruses and provide 
essential information for an effective national FMDV control programme in China.

MicroRNAs are implicated in many cellular processes such as cell differentiation 
and development, tumorigenesis, and immune regulation. In this study, miR192 was 
detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) when 
MDBK cells were exposed to Escherichia coli. Cells with malfunction of 
bta-miR-192 were established using transcription activator-like effector 
nuclease (TALEN) technology. Finally, bta-miR-192 mutant cells were screened for 
differentially expressed genes using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The results 
showed that miR192 significantly decreased in cells exposed to E. coli F18ac and 
E. coli K88ac. The RNA-seq results showed that 1673 differentially expressed 
transcripts were identified; 890 genes were upregulated and 775 genes were 
downregulated. With the gene ontology enrichment analysis, 431 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were classified into 937 gene ontology terms. The pathway 
enrichment analysis showed that 535 genes were involved in 254 pathway terms. 
Interestingly, most of these DEGs were associated with the pathways in cancers 
or infectious diseases. When the selected DEGs (n = 162) in these pathways were 
intersected with 120 differential transcripts, 11 DEGs were identified. 
Subsequently, several genes associated with regulation, cancers, or viral 
infections, such as LEF1, AXIN2, MX1, and FCGR2B, were identified among the DEGs 
using functional analysis. Furthermore, associations between bta-miR-192 and 
DEGs were detected by intersecting the bta-miR-192's target genes with the DEGs, 
indicating that three genes including CBL, DICER1 and TRERF1 were involved in 
this relationship. These findings provided useful guidance for investigating the 
role played by bta-miR-192 in cellular functionality in bovine cells.

Phylogenetic Analysis of the Rabies Virus N-coding Region in Lithuanian Rabies Isolates,"<jats:p>Rabies infection among wild and domestic animals constitutes a well-known problem in Lithuania, but only one dog rabies virus isolate sequence (1992) from Lithuania was used in the European rabies virus phylogenetic analysis. The objective of this work was to determine nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences and genetically characterize the rabies virus isolates in order to learn which virus group (biotype) is circulating in reservoir species in Lithuania. Classical rabies virus isolate nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences from different parts of Lithuania were found to be closely related to each other and demonstrated nucleotide identity from 97.7 to 100% and could be placed in one lineage with 100% bootstrap support. All 12 sequences of raccoon dogs, red foxes, dogs and marten rabies viruses exhibited 97.7 - 99.0% identity to previously published sequences from Eastern parts of Poland, Estonia, Finland, and the North-Eastern part of Russia. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Lithuanian strains belong to the North East Europe (NEE) group of rabies virus.</jats:p>",0

Between 2008 and 2010, 19 strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were 
isolated from the vaccinated chicken flocks in Sichuan province, China. The S1 
genes of the isolates were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis 
revealed that the 19 isolates and 37 reference IBV strains can be grouped into 
eight genotypes. Although IBVs of Taiwan-I type, massachusetts type, and 
proventriculitis type were isolated, but most isolates were LX4 genotype. 
Homology analysis of the sequences of S1 genes of the 19 isolates and 37 
reference IBV strains revealed that the identity of the nucleotides and amino 
acid sequences of the S1 genes between the 15 LX4-type isolates and other IBV 
strains were 71.9-99.3% and 72.1-99.1%, respectively, while those of the 
analyzed IBV of LX4 type were 96.0-99.9% and 94.3-99.8%, respectively. The 
results from this study and other published results in the GenBank database 
showed that isolates circulating in Sichuan province in recent years were mainly 
LX4 genotype, which is the predominant genotype circulated in China in recent 
years.

H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have become panzootic and caused sporadic 
human cases since 1998. Based on the poultry-related environmental surveillance 
data in mainland China from 2013 to 2016, a total of 68 representative 
environment isolates were selected and further investigated systematically. 
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Y280-like H9N2 viruses have been 
predominant during 2013-2016 and acquired multiple specific amino acid 
substitutions that might favor viral transmission from avian to mammalians. 
Additionally, the viruses have undergone dramatic evolution and reassortment, 
resulting in an increased genetic diversity or acting as the gene contributors 
to new avian viruses. Receptor-binding tests indicated that most of the H9N2 
isolates bound to human-type receptor, making them easily cross the species 
barrier and infect human efficiently. Our results suggested that the H9N2 AIVs 
prevalent in poultry may pose severe public health threat.

Phylogenetic relationships of rabies viruses recovered from black-backed jackals 
(Canis mesomelas) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) in northern South Africa 
were investigated to determine whether the black-backed jackal is an emerging 
maintenance host species for rabies in this region. A panel of 123 rabies 
viruses obtained from the two host species between 1980 and 2006 were 
characterised by nucleotide sequencing of the cytoplasmic domain of the 
glycoprotein gene and the non-coding G-L intergenic region. Through phylogenetic 
analysis a viral cluster specific to black-backed jackals and spanning a 5-year 
period was delineated in western Limpopo. Virus strains associated with domestic 
dogs prevail in densely populated communal areas in north-eastern Limpopo and in 
south and eastern Mpumalanga. The data presented in this study indicated the 
likelihood that black-backed jackals are capable of sustaining rabies cycles 
independent of domestic dogs. It is proposed that wildlife rabies control 
strategies, in synergy with domestic animal vaccination should be considered for 
effective control of rabies in South Africa.

Novel Picornavirus Associated with Avian Keratin Disorder in Alaskan Birds,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Avian keratin disorder (AKD), characterized by debilitating overgrowth of the avian beak, was first documented in black-capped chickadees (
            <jats:italic>Poecile atricapillus</jats:italic>
            ) in Alaska. Subsequently, similar deformities have appeared in numerous species across continents. Despite the widespread distribution of this emerging pathology, the cause of AKD remains elusive. As a result, it is unknown whether suspected cases of AKD in the afflicted species are causally linked, and the impacts of this pathology at the population and community levels are difficult to evaluate. We applied unbiased, metagenomic next-generation sequencing to search for candidate pathogens in birds affected with AKD. We identified and sequenced the complete coding region of a novel picornavirus, which we are calling poecivirus. Subsequent screening of 19 AKD-affected black-capped chickadees and 9 control individuals for the presence of poecivirus revealed that 19/19 (100%) AKD-affected individuals were positive, while only 2/9 (22%) control individuals were infected with poecivirus. Two northwestern crows (
            <jats:italic>Corvus caurinus</jats:italic>
            ) and two red-breasted nuthatches (
            <jats:italic>Sitta canadensis</jats:italic>
            ) with AKD-consistent pathology also tested positive for poecivirus. We suggest that poecivirus is a candidate etiological agent of AKD.

            Avian keratin disorder (AKD) is an increasingly common disease of wild birds. This disease, characterized by beak overgrowth, was first described in the late 1990s and has been spreading rapidly both geographically and in terms of host species affected. AKD decreases host fitness and can be fatal. However, the cause of the disease has remained elusive, and its impact on host populations is poorly understood. We found a novel and divergent picornavirus in 19/19 AKD-affected black-capped chickadees that we examined but in only 2/9 control cases. We also found this virus in 4 individuals of 2 other passerine species that exhibited symptoms consistent with AKD. Our data suggest that this novel picornavirus warrants further investigation as the causative agent of AKD.
