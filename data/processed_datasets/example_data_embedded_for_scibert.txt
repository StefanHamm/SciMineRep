Irbesartan Reduces QT Dispersion in <phrase_Q=1.000>Hypertensive</phrase> Individuals,"Abstract —<phrase_Q=1.000>Angiotensin</phrase> type 1 receptor antagonists have direct effects on the <phrase_Q=1.000>autonomic</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>nervous</phrase> system and <phrase_Q=1.000>myocardium</phrase>. Because of this, we hypothesized that irbesartan would reduce QT dispersion to a greater <phrase_Q=1.000>degree</phrase> than <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase>, a highly selective <phrase_Q=1.000>vasodilator</phrase>. To <phrase_Q=1.000>test</phrase> this, we gathered electrocardiographic (<phrase_Q=1.000>ECG</phrase>) <phrase_Q=1.000>data</phrase> from a <phrase_Q=1.000>multinational</phrase>, multicenter, <phrase_Q=1.000>randomized</phrase>, double-blind parallel group study that compared the <phrase_Q=1.000>antihypertensive</phrase> efficacy of irbesartan and <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> in elderly subjects with mild to moderate <phrase_Q=1.000>hypertension</phrase>. Subjects were treated for 6 months with either <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase>. <phrase_Q=1.000>Hydrochlorothiazide</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>atenolol</phrase> were added after 12 weeks if <phrase_Q=1.000>blood pressure</phrase> (<phrase_Q=1.000>BP</phrase>) remained uncontrolled. ECGs were obtained before <phrase_Q=1.000>randomization</phrase> and at 6 months. A total of 188 subjects (118 with baseline ECGs) were <phrase_Q=1.000>randomized</phrase>. We analyzed 104 subjects who had complete ECGs at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Baseline characteristics between treatments were similar, apart from a slight imbalance in <phrase_Q=1.000>diastolic</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>BP</phrase> (irbesartan [n=53] versus <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> [n=51], 99.2 [SD 3.6] versus 100.8 [3.8] mm Hg; P =0.03). There were no significant differences in <phrase_Q=1.000>BP</phrase> normalization (<phrase_Q=1.000>diastolic</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>BP</phrase> &lt;90 mm Hg) between treatments at 6 months (irbesartan versus <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase>, 80% versus 88%; P =0.378). We found a significant reduction in QT indexes in the irbesartan group (QTc dispersion mean, –11.4 [34.5] milliseconds, P =0.02; QTc max, –12.8 [35.5] milliseconds, P =0.01), and QTc dispersion did not correlate with the change in <phrase_Q=1.000>BP</phrase>. The reduction in QT indexes with <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> (QTc dispersion, –9.7 [35.4] milliseconds, P =0.06; QTc max, –8.6 [33.2] milliseconds, P =0.07) did not quite reach <phrase_Q=1.000>statistical significance</phrase>, but there was a correlation between the change in QT indexes and changes in systolic <phrase_Q=1.000>BP</phrase>. In conclusion, irbesartan improved QT dispersion, and this effect may be important in preventing <phrase_Q=1.000>sudden cardiac death</phrase> in at-<phrase_Q=1.000>risk</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>hypertensive</phrase> subjects."
Prevalence of Gingival Overgrowth Induced by <phrase_Q=1.000>Calcium Channel Blockers</phrase>: A <phrase_Q=1.000>Community</phrase>‐Based Study,"Background: The prevalence of gingival overgrowth induced by chronic medication with <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase> is uncertain. Although there have been several studies examining this question, the <phrase_Q=1.000>results</phrase> are conflicting, with previous estimates ranging from 20% to 83%. There have been only 2 studies examining the prevalence of overgrowth induced by <phrase_Q=1.000>diltiazem</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase>, with estimates of 74% and 3.3%, respectively.Methods: The current study aimed to address the problems associated with these studies by examining a sample of patients taking one of 3 <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase>, who were drawn from a <phrase_Q=1.000>community</phrase>‐based <phrase_Q=1.000>population</phrase> in northeastern <phrase_Q=1.000>England</phrase>. Nine hundred eleven (911) subjects were recruited from <phrase_Q=1.000>general</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>medical</phrase> practices in the <phrase_Q=1.000>area</phrase>. Of these, 442 were taking <phrase_Q=1.000>nifedipine</phrase>, 181 <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase>, and 186 <phrase_Q=1.000>diltiazem</phrase>. In addition, 102 control subjects were examined. <phrase_Q=1.000>Drug</phrase> and demographic <phrase_Q=1.000>data</phrase> for each subject were recorded. The periodontal condition of all subjects was assessed including plaque index, papillary bleeding index, and a <phrase_Q=1.000>photograph</phrase> of the anterior gingivae for subsequent analysis of overgrowth severity.Results: More than six percent (6.3%) of subjects taking <phrase_Q=1.000>nifedipine</phrase> were seen to have significant overgrowth. This overgrowth was statistically greater than the amount of overgrowth seen in either of the other 2 <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase> groups or the control <phrase_Q=1.000>population</phrase>. The prevalence of gingival overgrowth induced by <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> or <phrase_Q=1.000>diltiazem</phrase> was not statistically significant when compared to the control group. The severity of overgrowth within the <phrase_Q=1.000>nifedipine</phrase> group was found to be related to the amount of gingival <phrase_Q=1.000>inflammation</phrase> and also to the <phrase_Q=1.000>gender</phrase> of the subject, with males being 3 times as likely to develop overgrowth than females.Conclusions: The prevalence of clinically significant overgrowth related to chronic medication with <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase> is low, i.e., 6.3% for <phrase_Q=1.000>nifedipine</phrase>. Males are 3 times as likely as females to develop clinically significant overgrowth. The presence of gingival <phrase_Q=1.000>inflammation</phrase> is an important <phrase_Q=1.000>cofactor</phrase> for the expression of this effect."
Effects of <phrase_Q=1.000>Long</phrase>‐Acting Versus <phrase_Q=1.000>Short</phrase>‐Acting <phrase_Q=1.000>Calcium Channel Blockers</phrase> Among Older Survivors of <phrase_Q=1.000>Acute Myocardial Infarction</phrase>,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have highlighted the potentially harmful effects of <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>‐acting <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase>, especially of the <phrase_Q=1.000>dihydropyridine</phrase> type, in patients with <phrase_Q=1.000>coronary heart disease</phrase>. Some have argued that <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>‐acting <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase> are safer, but few outcome <phrase_Q=1.000>data</phrase> exist. The objective of the study was to compare the occurrence of adverse outcomes among recipients of <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>‐acting versus <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>‐acting <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase>, with dihydropyridines and non‐dihydropyridines compared separately.SETTING: The New <phrase_Q=1.000>Jersey</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Medicare</phrase> population.DESIGN: A retrospective <phrase_Q=1.000>cohort study</phrase> using linked <phrase_Q=1.000>Medicare</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase> claims data.PARTICIPANTS: Older survivors of <phrase_Q=1.000>acute myocardial infarction</phrase> (MI) occurring in 1989 and 1990. Eligible subjects had survived at least 30 days after the MI, participated in <phrase_Q=1.000>Medicare</phrase> and a <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase> benefits program, and were prescribed a <phrase_Q=1.000>single</phrase> type of either a <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>‐acting or a <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>‐acting <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blocker</phrase> within 90 days after the MI.MEASUREMENTS: The two outcome measures were rates of all‐cause mortality and <phrase_Q=1.000>cardiac</phrase> rehospitalization. Using separate Cox <phrase_Q=1.000>regression</phrase> models for dihydropyridines (<phrase_Q=1.000>nifedipine</phrase>, nicardipine) and non‐dihydropyridines (<phrase_Q=1.000>diltiazem</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>verapamil</phrase>), we examined these outcomes for recipients of <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>‐acting compared with <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>‐acting <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel</phrase> blockers.RESULTS: Of the 833 patients eligible for the study, 160 were prescribed <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>‐acting and 673 <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>‐acting <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase>. Clinical characteristics of <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>‐acting and <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>‐acting users were comparable. During 2 years of follow‐up, 221 deaths and 300 rehospitalizations occurred. Controlling for age, sex, <phrase_Q=1.000>race</phrase>, and indicators of <phrase_Q=1.000>disease</phrase> severity and <phrase_Q=1.000>comorbidity</phrase>, the <phrase_Q=1.000>relative risk</phrase> of dying for recipients of <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>‐acting, compared with <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>‐acting, dihydropyridines was .42 (95% <phrase_Q=1.000>confidence interval</phrase> (CI), 0.21‐0.86). For <phrase_Q=1.000>cardiac</phrase> rehospitalization, the <phrase_Q=1.000>relative risk</phrase> was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.34‐0.94). For the <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>‐acting versus <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>‐acting non‐dihydropyridines, the adjusted <phrase_Q=1.000>relative risk</phrase> of dying was 1.43 (95% CI, 0.88‐2.32), and for <phrase_Q=1.000>cardiac</phrase> rehospitalization, .65 (95% CI, 0.40‐1.05).CONCLUSION: Use of <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>‐acting <phrase_Q=1.000>dihydropyridine</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase> after acute MI was associated with substantially <phrase_Q=1.000>lower</phrase> rates of <phrase_Q=1.000>cardiac</phrase> rehospitalization and <phrase_Q=1.000>death</phrase> compared with use of their <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>‐acting counterparts. More <phrase_Q=1.000>data</phrase> are needed to address the possibility that <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>‐acting, compared with <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>‐acting, non‐dihydropyridines could decrease rehospitalization rates but increase mortality."
Retrospective analysis of the <phrase_Q=1.000>frequency</phrase> and recognition of adverse <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase> reactions by means of automatically recorded <phrase_Q=1.000>laboratory</phrase> signals,Aims To estimate the <phrase_Q=1.000>frequency</phrase> of adverse <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase> reactions (ADRs) identified through the use of automatic signals generated from <phrase_Q=1.000>laboratory</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>data</phrase> (ALS) in hospitalised patients. To determine the <phrase_Q=1.000>frequency</phrase> of spontaneous recognition of these ADRs by the attending <phrase_Q=1.000>physicians</phrase> and to assess the potential value of ALS for detection of ADRs. Methods <phrase_Q=1.000>Laboratory</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>results</phrase> of patients hospitalised in a nine bed <phrase_Q=1.000>medical</phrase> ward were automatically recorded over a <phrase_Q=1.000>period</phrase> of 17 months. Values exceeding defined boundaries were used as ALS. Charts of every third patient were analysed retrospectively with regard to adverse <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase> related reactions and <phrase_Q=1.000>causality</phrase> was evaluated as well as whether the ADR had been recognised during the <phrase_Q=1.000>period</phrase> of hospitalisation. <phrase_Q=1.000>Results</phrase> The charts and ALS of 98 patients were analysed. In 18 cases a <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase>‐related adverse <phrase_Q=1.000>reaction</phrase> was probable. Awareness to the <phrase_Q=1.000>reaction</phrase> by the treating <phrase_Q=1.000>physicians</phrase> was evident in 6 out of these 18 ADRs. Approximately 80% of the ADRs were considered predictable. Three ADRs were regarded as serious. Conclusions Adverse <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase> reactions are common and often preventable. Only one third of ADRs which could have been detected through ALS were recognised by the attending <phrase_Q=1.000>physicians</phrase>. An increased doctor’s awareness of the <phrase_Q=1.000>frequency</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase> related abnormal <phrase_Q=1.000>laboratory</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>results</phrase> by means of ALS is likely to increase the recognition rate of ADRs and might help to prevent them.
"<phrase_Q=1.000>Cohort study</phrase> on <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase>, other cardiovascular agents, and the prevalence of <phrase_Q=1.000>depression</phrase>","Aims Some reports have suggested that <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase> may be associated with an increased incidence of <phrase_Q=1.000>depression</phrase> or <phrase_Q=1.000>suicide</phrase>. There is a paucity of evidence from large scale studies. The aim of this study was to assess rates of <phrase_Q=1.000>depression</phrase> with <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel</phrase> antagonists using <phrase_Q=1.000>data</phrase> from prescription event monitoring studies. Methods Observational studies on large cohorts of patients using <phrase_Q=1.000>lisinopril</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>enalapril</phrase> (<phrase_Q=1.000>ACE inhibitors</phrase>), nicardipine (type 2 <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blocker</phrase>) and <phrase_Q=1.000>diltiazem</phrase> (type 3 <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blocker</phrase>) were conducted, using prescription‐event monitoring. Rates of <phrase_Q=1.000>depression</phrase> in the different <phrase_Q=1.000>drugs</phrase> and rate ratios (95% CI) were computed. <phrase_Q=1.000>Results</phrase> The crude overall rates of <phrase_Q=1.000>depression</phrase> during treatment were 1.89, 1.92 and 1.62 per 1000 patient months for the <phrase_Q=1.000>ACE inhibitors</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>diltiazem</phrase> and nicardipine, respectively. Using the <phrase_Q=1.000>ACE inhibitors</phrase> as the reference group, the rate ratios for <phrase_Q=1.000>depression</phrase> were 1.07 (0.82–1.40) and 0.86 (0.69–1.08) for <phrase_Q=1.000>diltiazem</phrase> and nicardipine, respectively. Conclusions This study does not support the <phrase_Q=1.000>hypothesis</phrase> that <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase> are associated with <phrase_Q=1.000>depression</phrase>, when considering patients treated in <phrase_Q=1.000>general</phrase> practice in the <phrase_Q=1.000>UK</phrase>."
Effect of <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> on exercise‐induced <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> activation in patients affected by chronic stable <phrase_Q=1.000>angina</phrase>,"AbstractBackground: <phrase_Q=1.000>Literature</phrase> concerning exercise‐induced <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> activation in chronic stable <phrase_Q=1.000>angina</phrase> is somewhat confusing. The reason lies in the type of exercise as well as in methodological problems. A powerful, recently introduced procedure to detect <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> activation is <phrase_Q=1.000>flow cytometry</phrase>. <phrase_Q=1.000>Platelet</phrase> response to activating factors is mediated by <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium</phrase> uptake; however, <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>antagonist</phrase> effect on <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> activity is still unclear.Hypothesis: The study was undertaken to investigate exercise‐induced <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> activation before and after treatment with <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> in chronic stable angina.Methods: Twenty patients with chronic stable <phrase_Q=1.000>angina</phrase> were entered into the study. Each subject underwent a <phrase_Q=1.000>symptom</phrase>‐limited cycloergometer stress <phrase_Q=1.000>test</phrase> following a <phrase_Q=1.000>washout</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>period</phrase> of 2 weeks. <phrase_Q=1.000>Blood</phrase> samples were collected before and immediately after exercise. All subjects were then <phrase_Q=1.000>randomized</phrase> into two groups of 10 patients each, with Group 1 and Group 2 taking <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> 10 mg/day, and <phrase_Q=1.000>placebo</phrase> for 4 weeks, respectively. They subsequently underwent a second exercise stress <phrase_Q=1.000>test</phrase>, and <phrase_Q=1.000>blood</phrase> samples were obtained before and immediately after exercise. Flow‐cytometric evaluation of <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> activity was performed in <phrase_Q=1.000>order</phrase> to recognize GMP‐140 expression on <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> membrane.Results: Strenuous exercise induced a significant increase in <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> activation in all subjects prior to therapy. No significant differences were observed in <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> activity at rest between Groups 1 and 2, whereas a significant decrease in exercise‐induced <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> activation was demonstrated in Group 1 compared with Group 2.Conclusion: Our <phrase_Q=1.000>data</phrase> provide evidence of the favorable effect of <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> on exercise‐induced <phrase_Q=1.000>platelet</phrase> activation in patients affected by chronic stable <phrase_Q=1.000>angina</phrase>."
Initiation of <phrase_Q=1.000>Atrial Fibrillation</phrase> by <phrase_Q=1.000>Ectopic</phrase> Beats Originating From the Pulmonary Veins,"Background —<phrase_Q=1.000>Atrial fibrillation</phrase> (AF) can be initiated by <phrase_Q=1.000>ectopic</phrase> beats originating from the <phrase_Q=1.000>atrial</phrase> or great venous tissues. This study investigated the anatomic characteristics and <phrase_Q=1.000>electrophysiological</phrase> properties of pulmonary veins (PVs), as well as the possible mechanisms and response to <phrase_Q=1.000>drugs</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>ectopic</phrase> foci, and assessed the effects of <phrase_Q=1.000>radiofrequency</phrase> (RF) <phrase_Q=1.000>ablation</phrase> on AF initiated by <phrase_Q=1.000>ectopic</phrase> beats originating from PVs. Methods and <phrase_Q=1.000>Results</phrase> —Seventy-nine patients with frequent episodes of paroxysmal AF and 10 control patients were included. Distal PVs showed the shortest effective <phrase_Q=1.000>refractory</phrase> periods (ERPs), and right <phrase_Q=1.000>superior</phrase> PVs showed a higher incidence of intra-PV conduction block than left <phrase_Q=1.000>superior</phrase> PVs. <phrase_Q=1.000>Superior</phrase> and left PVs had longer myocardial sleeves than inferior and right PVs, respectively. These <phrase_Q=1.000>electrophysiological</phrase> characteristics were similar between AF and control patients. <phrase_Q=1.000>Propranolol</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>verapamil</phrase>, and <phrase_Q=1.000>procainamide</phrase> suppressed <phrase_Q=1.000>ectopic</phrase> beats that originated from the PVs. Of 116 <phrase_Q=1.000>ectopic</phrase> foci that initiated AF, 103 (88.8%) originated from PVs. A mean of 7±3 RF applications completely eliminated 110 <phrase_Q=1.000>ectopic</phrase> foci (94.8%). During the 6±2-month follow-up <phrase_Q=1.000>period</phrase>, 68 patients (86.1%) were <phrase_Q=1.000>free</phrase> of AF without any <phrase_Q=1.000>antiarrhythmic</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>drugs</phrase>. Follow-up transesophageal <phrase_Q=1.000>echocardiogram</phrase> showed 42.4% of ablated PVs had focal <phrase_Q=1.000>stenosis</phrase>. One patient had mild exertional <phrase_Q=1.000>dyspnea</phrase> after <phrase_Q=1.000>ablation</phrase>, but it resolved 3 months later; 1 patient had onset of mild exertional <phrase_Q=1.000>dyspnea</phrase> 5 months after <phrase_Q=1.000>ablation</phrase>. Conclusions —<phrase_Q=1.000>Electrophysiological</phrase> characteristics of PVs are different from those in the atria. <phrase_Q=1.000>Ectopic</phrase> beats from PVs can initiate AF, and β-<phrase_Q=1.000>adrenergic receptor</phrase> blocker, <phrase_Q=1.000>calcium channel blockers</phrase>, and <phrase_Q=1.000>sodium channel</phrase> blockers can suppress these <phrase_Q=1.000>ectopic</phrase> beats. Careful mapping and elimination of these <phrase_Q=1.000>ectopic</phrase> foci can <phrase_Q=1.000>cure</phrase> paroxysmal AF."
<phrase_Q=1.000>Esophageal</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Motility</phrase> Disorders: Current Concepts of <phrase_Q=1.000>Pathogenesis</phrase> and Treatment,"Current concepts of <phrase_Q=1.000>esophageal</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>motility</phrase> disorders are summarized. Primary <phrase_Q=1.000>data</phrase> sources were located via <phrase_Q=1.000>MEDLINE</phrase> or cross-citation. No attempt was made to be <phrase_Q=1.000>comprehensive</phrase> or inclusive of the <phrase_Q=1.000>literature</phrase> because fewer than 10% of citations are discussed. Instead, emphasis was placed on new developments in diagnosis, therapeutics, and practice patterns. Controlled therapeutic trials and pathophysiological observations are emphasized. <phrase_Q=1.000>Achalasia</phrase> is a <phrase_Q=1.000>rare disease</phrase> of failed <phrase_Q=1.000>lower</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>sphincter</phrase> relaxation and aperistalsis. Diffuse <phrase_Q=1.000>esophageal</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>spasm</phrase> (DES), an equally <phrase_Q=1.000>rare disease</phrase>, is defined by non-propagated <phrase_Q=1.000>esophageal</phrase> contractions. Nonspecific <phrase_Q=1.000>motility</phrase> disorders, including <phrase_Q=1.000>nutcracker</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>esophagus</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>hypertensive</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>lower</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>esophageal</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>sphincter</phrase>, are identified only by manometry and are ten times as prevalent. <phrase_Q=1.000>Neuromuscular</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>pathology</phrase> is evident only with <phrase_Q=1.000>achalasia</phrase> (myenteric plexus <phrase_Q=1.000>neurons</phrase> destruction). Pharmacological therapies have limited efficacy with <phrase_Q=1.000>achalasia</phrase>; more limited with DES; and none with the nonspecific <phrase_Q=1.000>motility</phrase> disorders. More efficacious therapies for the nonspecific disorders are <phrase_Q=1.000>directed</phrase> at associated <phrase_Q=1.000>reflux</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>disease</phrase> or <phrase_Q=1.000>psychiatric</phrase> disorders. Pneumatic dilation is effective therapy for <phrase_Q=1.000>achalasia</phrase> 72% of instances, but frequently requires repeat dilation and is complicated by a 3% perforation rate. Surgical myotomy is effective in 88% of achalasics; morbidity from <phrase_Q=1.000>thoracotomy</phrase> has been the <phrase_Q=1.000>major</phrase> limitation but this has been sharply reduced with a <phrase_Q=1.000>laparoscopic</phrase> approach. In conclusion, although it has been suggested that <phrase_Q=1.000>esophageal</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>motility</phrase> disorders are distinct clinical entities, critical review of the <phrase_Q=1.000>literature</phrase> supports this only in the case of <phrase_Q=1.000>achalasia</phrase>, a <phrase_Q=1.000>disease</phrase> of well defined <phrase_Q=1.000>pathophysiology</phrase>, functional disturbance, and therapies. This clarity diminishes progressively for DES and non-specific <phrase_Q=1.000>esophageal</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>motility</phrase> disorders."

Twenty four patients with <phrase_Q=1.000>diastolic</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>blood pressure</phrase> (DBP) between 95 and 104 mm Hg received <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> 2.5 mg and 5 mg, <phrase_Q=1.000>lisinopril</phrase> 5 mg and 10 mg, and their combination as per a prior randomisation schedule. <phrase_Q=1.000>Supine</phrase> and standing <phrase_Q=1.000>blood pressure</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>heart rate</phrase> were recorded at weekly intervals. Higher doses of both the <phrase_Q=1.000>drugs</phrase> individually or in combination were used if the <phrase_Q=1.000>target</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>supine</phrase> DBP below 90 mm Hg was not achieved. There was a significant additional <phrase_Q=1.000>blood pressure</phrase> lowering effect with the combination when compared either with <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> or <phrase_Q=1.000>lisinopril</phrase> alone. Five mg <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> and 10 mg <phrase_Q=1.000>lisinopril</phrase> monotherapy achieved the <phrase_Q=1.000>target</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>blood pressure</phrase> in 71% and 72% patients respectively. The combination of 2.5 mg <phrase_Q=1.000>amlodipine</phrase> with 5 mg <phrase_Q=1.000>lisinopril</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>produced</phrase> a much more significant lowering of <phrase_Q=1.000>blood pressure</phrase> in a higher percentage of patients than that with an individual low dose."
