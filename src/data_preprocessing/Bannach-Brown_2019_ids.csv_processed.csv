Inhibition of cellular transport processes by 5-thio-<scp>d</scp>-glucopyranose,"<jats:p>5-Thio-d-glucopyranose, the nearest analogue of normal d-glucose, which is proving a useful tool in examinations of d-glucose biochemistry, affects active and facilitated-diffusion transport processes. 5-Thio-d-glucose is readily transported in rabbit kidney-cortex slices and reaches a tissue/medium ratio of 6.5 within 40min. The sulphur analogue shows typical saturation kinetics with a Km value of 2.4mm and Vmax. value of 70μmol/h per g of cell water. Uptake of 5-thio-d-glucose is phlorrhizin-sensitive, Na+-dependent and energy-dependent. d-Galactose and methyl α-d-glucopyranoside transport is competitively inhibited by 5-thio-d-glucose with Ki values of 4.8 and 9.7mm respectively. 5-Thio-d-glucose thus shows all of the characteristics of active transport in kidney cortex. Transport of neutral amino acids in rat kidney cortex is inhibited by 5-thio-d-glucose. Thus 5.6mm-5-thio-d-glucose causes a 25–30% inhibition of the transport of glycine and the non-metabolized amino acids cycloleucine and α-aminoisobutyric acid. 5-Thio-d-glucose is freely taken up by the facilitated-diffusion transport system in rat diaphragm muscle. The sulphur analogue inhibits the transport of d-xylose in this tissue but has no effect on the uptake of d-arabinose. It is concluded that the ring heteroatom is not an effector of binding in the transport processes examined and causes no important alteration in the conformation of the sugar. The diabetogenic action produced by 5-thio-d-glucose is due, in part, to the ability of the analogue to interfere with cellular transport processes that use d-glucose.</jats:p>",0

Long‐lasting marked inhibition of periaqueductal gray‐evoked defensive behaviors in inescapably‐shocked rats,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Clinical evidence suggests that depression and trauma predispose the subject to panic. Accordingly, here we examined the late effects of uncontrollable stress, a presumptive model of depression and/or traumatic disorder, on panic‐like behaviors evoked by electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DPAG</jats:styled-content>). Changes in anxiety and depression were also assessed in the elevated plus‐maze (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">EPM</jats:styled-content>) and forced‐swimming test (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">FST</jats:styled-content>), respectively. Rats with electrodes in the <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DPAG</jats:styled-content> were subjected to a 7‐day shuttle‐box one‐way escape yoked training with foot‐shocks either escapable (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ES</jats:styled-content>) or inescapable (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IS</jats:styled-content>). The day after the end of one‐way escape training, rats were trained in a two‐way escape novel task (test‐session) to ascertain the effectiveness of uncontrollable stress. <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DPAG</jats:styled-content> stimulations were carried out in an open field, both before the escape training and 2 and 7 days after it, and <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">EPM</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">FST</jats:styled-content> were performed on the 8th and 10th days afterwards, respectively. Controls were either trained with fictive shocks (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">FS</jats:styled-content>) or subjected to intracranial stimulations only. Although the <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ES</jats:styled-content> rats performed significantly better than the <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IS</jats:styled-content> group in the two‐way escape task, groups did not differ with respect to either the anxiety or depression scores. Unexpectedly, however, <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IS</jats:styled-content> rats showed a marked attenuation of <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DPAG</jats:styled-content>‐evoked freezing and flight behaviors relative to both the <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ES</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">FS</jats:styled-content> groups, 2 and 7 days after one‐way escape training. The conjoint inhibition of passive (freezing) and active (flight) defensive behaviors suggests that <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IS</jats:styled-content> inhibits a <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DPAG</jats:styled-content> in‐built motivational system that may be implicated in depressed patients' difficulties in coping with daily‐life stress.</jats:p>",1

Chinese medicine Banxia‐houpu decoction regulates c‐fos expression in the brain regions in chronic mild stress model in rats,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Banxia‐houpu decoction is a safe and effective traditional Chinese medicinal formula used in the treatment of mild and manic‐depressive disorders for centuries. There has been increasing interest in its therapeutic application in depression. However, the mechanisms behind behavioural changes are still poorly understood. Chronic mild stress (CMS)‐induced preference behaviour change has been used as a model to predict the clinical efﬁcacy of many types of antidepressant treatment. Both EtOH and water extracts (AE and WE) of Banxia‐houpu decoction exhibited a signiﬁcantly increased sucrose intake in the CMS model in rats, but there was no effect in unstressed animals. In the present study, it was found that the c‐fos expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum corpora were very high in the CMS model in rats. WE and AE at a dose of 130 mg/kg exhibited a signiﬁcantly decreased c‐fos expression in the cerebral regions in CMS model in rats, respectively. The former was more potent than the latter. However, no signiﬁcant changes in the c‐fos expression were observed in unstressed rats treated with the decoction. Fluoxetine not only signiﬁcantly reduced c‐fos expression in all regions in the CMS model in rats, but only showed a marked decrease in c‐fos expression in the hippocampus in unstressed animals. A different molecular mechanism of Banxia‐houpu decoction and ﬂuoxetine may be implied. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum conpora might be important structural substrates in the central nervous system mediating the section of the Banxia‐houpu decoction on preference behaviour in CMS‐induced rats, and fos protein might be the common substrate of the signal transduction process of the decoction.

"Effect of Chronic Lead on the Haematology, Blood Glutathione and Bone Marrow Non‐Haeme Iron of Dogs","<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract</jats:bold> Ten clinically normal male beagle dogs were used in the study. Two dogs served as control, 4 received 2 mg lead/kg daily and 4 received 5 mg lead/kg/daily. Lead was administered for 13 weeks, after which one‐half of each experimental group was treated with calcium ethylene diaminetetraacetate (CaEDTA) for 5 days. All animals were then monitored for another 4 weeks. Blood lead levels, haematology, blood glutathione concentration, and the number of bone marrow cells with stainable iron granules were measured weekly during the 18‐week experimental period. Clinical signs of poisoning were observed only in one dog in the high dose group after 6 weeks. The signs included emaciation, anorexia, muscular weakness, evidence of abdominal pain and depression. These signs were reversed with cessation of lead dosing and CaEDTA treatment. Blood lead levels and the number of marrow cells with non‐haeme iron increased in both lead‐dosed groups; nucleated red blood cells increased only in high lead dosed group. There was a trend for an increased packed cell volume in all groups; however, the high lead dosed group did not increase as fast. No significant changes were observed in blood glutathione concentration and in other haematologic parameters. There were no differences in the parameters studied between the dogs treated with CaEDTA and those not so treated. Blood lead levels and the number of nucleated red blood cells decreased after cessation of lead administration and the number of marrow cells with iron also tended to decrease after lead removal.</jats:p>",0

A miniature mechanical ventilator for newborn mice,"<jats:p>Kolandaivelu, Kumaran, and Chi-Sang Poon.A miniature mechanical ventilator for newborn mice. J. Appl. Physiol. 84(2): 733–739, 1998.—Transgenic/knockout mice with predefined mutations have become increasingly popular in biomedical research as models of human diseases. In some instances, the resulting mutation may cause cardiorespiratory distress in the neonatal or adult animals and may necessitate resuscitation. Here we describe the design and testing of a miniature and versatile ventilator that can deliver varying ventilatory support modes, including conventional mechanical ventilation and high-frequency ventilation, to animals as small as the newborn mouse. With a double-piston body chamber design, the device circumvents the problem of air leakage and obviates the need for invasive procedures such as endotracheal intubation, which are particularly important in ventilating small animals. Preliminary tests on newborn mice as early as postnatal day 0 demonstrated satisfactory restoration of pulmonary ventilation and the prevention of respiratory failure in mutant mice that are prone to respiratory depression. This device may prove useful in the postnatal management of transgenic/knockout mice with genetically inflicted respiratory disorders.</jats:p>",0

Effects of data structure and selection on estimated inbreeding depression in experimental <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> lines,"<jats:sec><jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Inbreeding depression was estimated for four experimental <jats:italic>Tribolium castaneum</jats:italic> lines. Each line, containing approximately 7000 animals, was selected for 16 generations either randomly (control), on pupae weight (PWT), on family size (FST) or on an index containing both PWT and FST. The inbreeding trend was 0.9, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.4 % inbreeding per generation in PWT‐selected, FST‐selected, index‐selected, and control line, respectively. The model used to estimate the inbreeding depression included a linear regression on individual inbreeding coefficients, and random additive genetic effects. Using all the performance and pedigree data, estimated inbreeding depressions in the control line were —0.13 (SE = 0.16; #) and —8.50 (SE = 2.66; μg) per 1 % inbreeding for FST and PWT, respectively. Using only performance data of the latest generation in the control line, the estimated inbreeding depressions changed considerably: —0.17 (SE = 0.82) and —37.4 (SE= 11.9) for FST and PWT, respectively. Estimated inbreeding depression for FST in the FST‐selected line was — 0.40 (SE = 0.31). Inbreeding depression for PWT in the PWT‐selected line was 21.6 (SE = 25.8). This study indicates that estimating inbreeding depression might best be based on the performance data of animals with an equal and sufficiently‐large number of ancestral generations known.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Zusammenfassung</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Wirkung von Datenstruktur und Selektion auf geschätzte Inzuchtdepression in experimentellen Triboleum castaneum Linien</jats:italic></jats:p><jats:p>Jede der vier experimentellen Linien, aus je etwa 7000 Individuen, wurde durch 16 Generationen selektiert, zufällig die Kontrolle, auf Puppengewicht (PWT), Familiengröße (FST), oder auf einen beide Merkmale kombinierenden Index.

"Dietary interactions of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) trypsin inhibitor, haemagglutinin and cyanide Part 2.

The results indicate that when fed at the same level of activity as found in the raw lima bean (RLB) these factors had no significant <jats:italic>(p</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05) influence on pancreatic α‐amylase activity whether acting individually or in combination. However, when acting alone, CN appeared to depress pancreatic amylase level more than when interacting with TI or Hgg or both. Amylase activity was significantly (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) depressed by the dietary treatments in both the small and large intestine while caecal levels were not. The most severe depression in amylase activity was elicited by the RLB diet. The haemagglutinin‐containing diets appeared generally associated with lower levels of intestinal amylase activity.</jats:p><jats:p>From the present finding it is suggested that these factors alone cannot fully account for the magnitude of the depression of intestinal amylase activity which is contingent upon the ingestion of RLB by experimental rats.</jats:p>",0
Developmental profile of GABA<sub>A</sub>‐mediated synaptic transmission in pyramidal cells of the somatosensory cortex,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA)<jats:sub>A</jats:sub> receptors is involved in regulation of experience‐dependent cortical plasticity. However, little information is available on their presynaptic and postsynaptic developmental profiles. The present study aims to investigate the developmental changes of miniature and unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs and uIPSCs) in mouse barrel cortex. mIPSCs recorded from supragranular pyramidal neurons showed a gradual increase in frequency during postnatal days 6–15 (PD6–15) followed by a marked increase at PD16–20, and mIPSCs frequency reached a plateau at about PD21–30. The amplitude of mIPSCs showed a transient decrease at PD10–12 followed by an increase during PD13–30, and reached a plateau at about PD30. Their decay time constant progressively decreased during the first 30 days postnatally, and reached a steady level at about PD30. Paired recordings from interneurons and synaptically coupled target pyramidal cells revealed that uIPSC amplitude increased with age up to PD30. In contrast, failure rate and coefficient of variation decreased during PD7–15 and showed little change at a later stage. Short‐term depression induced by presynaptic stimulation at 33 Hz progressively decreased during PD6–20, and was stabilized at about PD21–30. Quantal analysis revealed that the number of release sites increased with age up to PD30, while the release probability increased during PD6–12 and then reached a plateau level. These results suggest that the number of release sites and release probability of GABA and GABA<jats:sub>A</jats:sub>‐mediated IPSC kinetics show distinct developmental profiles, which could play roles in regulating the onset and offset of critical periods for experience‐dependent cortical plasticity.</jats:p>",0

"Heavy metals zinc, cadmium, and copper stimulate pulmonary sensory neurons via direct activation of TRPA1","<jats:p> Airway exposure to zinc dust and zinc-containing ambient particulates can cause symptoms of airway irritation and inflammation, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are largely unknown. Transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) is selectively expressed in a subpopulation of pulmonary C-fiber afferents and has been considered as a major irritant sensor in the lung and airways. Using whole cell patch-clamp recording and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> imaging, we have demonstrated that application of ZnCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration dependently evoked inward current and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> transient in isolated vagal pulmonary sensory neurons; both responses were almost completely inhibited after pretreatment with AP18, a specific TRPA1 antagonist. In anesthetized spontaneously breathing animals, intratracheal instillation of ZnCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (2 mM, 25 μl) induced pronounced respiratory depression in wild-type mice, and the effect was essentially absent in TRPA1-deficient mice. In addition, our study showed that two other heavy metals, cadmium and copper, also stimulated pulmonary sensory neurons via a direct activation of TRPA1. In summary, our results suggest that activation of TRPA1 in pulmonary C-fiber sensory nerves may contribute to the respiratory toxicity induced by airway exposure to these three heavy metals. </jats:p>",0

"Astragalar morphology of <i>Afradapis</i>, a large adapiform primate from the earliest late Eocene of Egypt","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The ∼37 million‐year‐old Birket Qarun Locality 2 (BQ‐2), in the Birket Qarun Formation of Egypt's Fayum Depression, yields evidence for a diverse primate fauna, including the earliest known lorisiforms, parapithecoid anthropoids, and <jats:italic>Afradapis longicristatus</jats:italic>, a large folivorous adapiform. Phylogenetic analysis has placed <jats:italic>Afradapis</jats:italic> as a stem strepsirrhine within a clade of caenopithecine adapiforms, contradicting the recently popularized alternative hypothesis aligning adapiforms with haplorhines or anthropoids. We describe an astragalus from BQ‐2 (DPC 21445C), attributable to <jats:italic>Afradapis</jats:italic> on the basis of size and relative abundance. The astragalus is remarkably similar to those of extant lorises, having a low body, no posterior shelf, a broad head and neck. It is like extant strepsirrhines more generally, in having a fibular facet that slopes gently away from the lateral tibial facet, and in having a groove for the tendon of flexor fibularis that is lateral to the tibial facet. Comparisons to a sample of euarchontan astragali show the new fossil to be most similar to those of adapines and lorisids. The astragali of other adapiforms are most similar to those of lemurs, but distinctly different from those of all anthropoids. Our measurements show that in extant strepsirrhines and adapiforms the fibular facet slopes away from the lateral tibial facet at a gradual angle (112–126°), in contrast to the anthropoid fibular facet, which forms a sharper angle (87–101°). Phylogenetic analyses incorporating new information from the astragalus continue to support strepsirrhine affinities for adapiforms under varying models of character evolution.

Losartan increases renal blood flow during isoflurane anesthesia in sheep,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Inhaled anesthetics cause a transient reversible depression of renal function by direct renal effects or indirectly by changes in neurohumoral systems or cardiovascular performance. When the sympathetic nervous activity is decreased during anesthesia, other vasoactive systems like vasopressin (AVP) and particularly the renin angiotensin system (RAS) are of importance for blood pressure maintenance. Little is known about how the renal circulation is affected by angiotensin receptor blockade during isoflurane anesthesia.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> The study was performed on isoflurane anesthetized sheep equipped with flow probes (placed around a femoral and a renal artery) and a pulmonary artery catheter. During stable conditions the sheep were given one or more of the following substances: isotonic saline (NaCl); losartan (LOS) 10 mg ·  kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; prazosin (PRAZ) 0.2 mg · kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>  and a vasopressin V<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>‐receptor antagonist (AVP‐a) 10 μg · kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> LOS and AVP‐a did not affect mean arterial pressure (MAP), whereas PRAZ lowered MAP significantly (from 98±12 to 65±7 mmHg). Renal blood flow (RBF) increased after LOS treatment (148±34 to 222±33 ml · min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). The other substances were without effect on RBF. Femoral blood flow remained unchanged after all treatments.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We conclude that the sympathoadrenal system is still the major determinant for blood pressure maintenance during isoflurane anesthesia in sheep. The apparently increased activity of the renin angiotensin system in this situation causes a reduction in renal blood flow, which is counteracted by angiotensin II AT<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>‐receptor blockade.</jats:p>",0

The onset of response habituation during the growth of the lateral giant neuron of crayfish,"<jats:p> 1. The postembryonic development of the crayfish LG tailflip command neuron's response to mechanosensory input was studied with standard electrophysiological techniques in animals between 1 and 12 cm long. 2. LG neurons are present in each abdominal hemisegment where they receive direct and indirect excitatory input from mechanosensory afferents. In both small and large crayfish, electrical stimulation of an abdominal ganglionic nerve containing those afferents evoked a compound excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) with an early, reliable alpha component and a later, depression-prone beta wave. It is known that the alpha and beta components are produced by inputs from primary mechanosensory afferents and interneurons, respectively. 3. In crayfish &lt; 2 cm long, LG was excited by the alpha component. When superthreshold, the alpha component triggered a single spike; additional excitation provided by the later beta wave presumably was preempted by refractoriness following the alpha spike and by recurrent inhibition of LG excited by the spike. LG was excited reliably by the alpha component in response to repeated superthreshold stimulation. 4. In crayfish between 2 and 3 cm, LG was excited more readily by the beta wave than by the alpha component. LG's beta spike response habituated to repeated stimulation at 1 Hz, and the beta EPSP depressed whereas the alpha component was largely unchanged. The appearance of the cellular substrates of habituation correlates with the reported onset of behavioral habituation of the tailflip response. Higher stimulus levels brought the alpha EPSP to threshold. Repetitive stimulation at these levels reliably evoked LG spikes from the alpha EPSP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </jats:p>",0

Effects of isoproterenol on myocardial  structure and function in septic rats,"<jats:p> In this study we sought to determine the effect of sepsis on two sequelae of prolonged (24-h) β-agonist administration, myocardial hypertrophy and catecholamine-induced cardiotoxicity. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) or sham study groups and then further randomized to receive isoproterenol (2.4 mg ⋅ kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> ⋅ day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> iv) or placebo treatment. At 24 h, myocardial function was assessed by using the Langendorff isolated-heart technique or the heart processed for plain light microscopy. We found that 1) sepsis reduced contractile function, indicated by a rightward shift in the Starling curve (ANOVA with repeated measures, sepsis effect, P &lt; 0.002); 2) sepsis-induced myocardial depression was reversed by isoproterenol treatment (isoproterenol effect, P &lt; 0.0001); 3) sepsis reduced, but did not block, isoproterenol-induced myocardial hypertrophy (isoproterenol effect, P &lt; 0.0001); 4) sepsis did not protect the heart from catecholamine-induced tissue injury; 5) the septic heart was protected against the effects of ischemiareperfusion (decreased postreperfusion resting tension, ANOVA with repeated measures, P &lt; 0.01), an effect attenuated by isoproterenol treatment ( P &lt; 0.005); and 6) sepsis reduced the incidence of sustained asystole or ventricular fibrillation after ischemia-reperfusion ( P &lt; 0.05), an effect also attenuated by isoproterenol treatment ( P &lt; 0.01). We conclude that, in sepsis, β-agonists induce changes in myocardial weight and function consistent with acute myocardial hypertrophy. These changes occur at the expense of significant tissue injury and increased sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion-induced tissue injury. </jats:p>",0

Pentobarbital Depressant Effects Are Independent of GABA Receptors in Auditory Thalamic Neurons,"<jats:p> Pentobarbital, a general anesthetic, has received extensive study for its ability to potentiate inhibition at GABA<jats:sub>A</jats:sub> subtype of receptors for GABA. Using whole cell current-clamp techniques and bath applications, we determined the effects of pentobarbital and GABA receptor antagonists on the membrane properties and tonic or burst firing of medial geniculate neurons in thalamic slices. Pentobarbital (0.01–200 μM) induced depressant effects in 50 of 66 neurons (76%). Pentobarbital hyperpolarized neurons by a mean of 3 mV and decreased the number of action potentials in tonic firing, evoked by current pulse injection from near the resting potential. Pentobarbital also decreased burst firing or low threshold Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>-spikes, evoked by current pulse injection into neurons at potentials hyperpolarized from rest. The blockade of tonic and burst firing, as well as low threshold Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>-spikes, was surmountable by increasing the amplitude of input current. The GABA<jats:sub>A</jats:sub> receptor antagonists, bicuculline (100 μM) and picrotoxinin (50–100 μM), did not block the depressant effects of pentobarbital (10 μM). The GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> receptor antagonist, saclofen (200 μM), and GABA<jats:sub>C</jats:sub> receptor antagonist, (1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)methylphosphinate (10–50 μM), did not significantly alter the depressant effects. Pentobarbital produced excitatory effects (0.1–50 μM) on 11 neurons (17%) but had no effects on 5 neurons (7%). The excitation consisted of approximately 3 mV depolarization, increased tonic and burst firing and the rate of rise and amplitude of low threshold Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> spikes. These effects were associated with a increase in input resistance. In contrast, the depressant effects of pentobarbital correlated to a decreased input resistance measured with hyperpolarizing current pulse injection (IC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> = 7.8 μM). Pentobarbital reduced Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-dependent rectification on depolarization and lowered the slope resistance over a wide voltage range. Tetrodotoxin eliminated both Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-dependent rectification and the pentobarbital-induced decrease in membrane resistance at depolarized voltages in two-thirds of the neurons. The pentobarbital-induced decrease in membrane resistance at voltages hyperpolarized from rest was not evident during co-application with Cs<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, known to block the hyperpolarization-activated rectifiers. In summary, the pentobarbital acted at low concentrations to depress thalamocortical neurons. The depression resulted from decreased rectification on depolarization, which no longer boosted potentials over threshold, and an increased conductance that shunted spike generation. The depressant effects of pentobarbital did not involve known types of GABA receptor interactions. </jats:p>",0

"Seasonality of dihydropyridine receptor binding in the heart of an anoxia-tolerant vertebrate, the crucian carp (<i>Carassius carassius</i>L.)","<jats:p>Prolonged anoxia tolerance of facultative anaerobes is based on metabolic depression and thus on controlled reduction of energy-utilizing processes. One proposed survival mechanism is the closing of ion channels to decrease energetic cost of ion pumping (Hochachka PW. Science 231: 234–241, 1986). To test this hypothesis, the involvement of L-type Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>channels in seasonal anoxia tolerance of the vertebrate heart was examined by determining the number of [ methyl-<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]PN200–110 (a ligand of L-type Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>channel α-subunit) binding sites of the cardiac tissue and the density of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>current in ventricular myocytes of an anoxia-resistant fish species, the crucian carp. In their natural environment, the fish were exposed for &gt;3 mo of hypoxia (O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>&lt;2.5 mg/l) followed by almost 8 wk of anoxia that resulted in abrupt depletion of cardiac glycogen stores in late spring. Unexpectedly, however, the number of [ methyl-<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]PN200–110 binding sites did not decline in hypoxia/anoxia as predicted by the channel arrest hypothesis but remained constant for most of the year. However, in early summer, the number of [ methyl-<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]PN200–110 binding sites doubled for a period of ∼2 mo, which functionally appeared as a 74% larger Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>current density. Thus the anoxia tolerance of the carp heart cannot be based on downregulation of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>channel units in myocytes but is likely to depend on suppressed heart rate, i.e., regulation of the heart at the systemic level, and direct depressive effects of low temperature on Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>current to achieve savings in cardiac work load and ion pumping. The summer peak in the number of functional Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>channels indicates a short period of high cardiac activity possibly associated with reproduction and active perfusion of tissues after the winter stresses.</jats:p>",0

Depression of Nociceptive Sensory Activity in the Rat Spinal Cord Due to the Intrathecal Administration of Drugs: Effect of Diazepam,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title />
                  <jats:p>The intrathecal (i.t.) administration of morphine inhibits nociceptive motor responses and activity in ascending axons evoked by stimulation of nociceptive afferent nerve fibers (nociceptive sensory response) in the rat. The i.t. administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide and ceruletide inhibits nociceptive motor responses, but does not affect ascending nociceptive activity. This shows that drug-induced depression of nociceptive motor responses is not always associated with depression of the nociceptive sensory response of the spinal cord. The microiontophoretic application of substance P excites single dorsal horn neurons that respond to noxious stimulation, whereas the i.t. administration of substance P inhibits both nociceptive motor and sensory responses. Thus, the results obtained from the i.t. administration of a drug may differ from those obtained from its application to single spinal neurons. Diazepam inhibits spinal reflexes and may reduce pain sensation in humans. To assess whether a spinal action is involved in the pain-relieving effect of diazepam, experiments were carried out on spinalized rats in which activity evoked by the stimulation of nociceptive and nonnociceptive afferent nerve fibers of the sural nerve was recorded from single ascending axons below the site of spinal cord transection. Diazepam, 20 ųg i.t., reduced activity evoked by afferent A delta and C fiber stimulation and by stimulation of afferent A beta fibers. The depressant effect caused by diazepam, 2 mg/kg i.v., on C fiber-evoked ascending activity was reduced by the i.t. injection of the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (40 ųg), an imidazodiazepine. It is concluded that the depression by diazepam of C fiber-evoked ascending activity contributes to pain relief caused by the drug.</jats:p>

The Response of the Kidney of the Freshwater Rainbow Trout to True Metabolic Acidosis,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Infusion of lactic acid into the bloodstream of trout produced a short-lived depression of blood pH and a long-lasting elevation of blood lactate. The lactate injected was distributed in a volume of 198 ml/kg. Renal excretion of lactate anion and total acid increased by approximately equal amounts during the period of high blood lactate levels, but total renal loss over 72 h accounted for only 2% of the lactate load and 6% of the proton load. Comparable differences in the time courses of blood lactate and pH changes occurred when lactacidosis was induced endogenously by normocapnic hypoxia. The immediate response of the kidney was similar to that with lactic acid infusion, but there was a long-lasting (12–72+ h) elevation of urinary acid efflux that was not associated with lactate excretion. Following hypoxia, renal excretion over 72 h accounted for 1 % of the estimated lactate load and 12-25% °f proton load. A renal lactate threshold of 4–10 μequiv/ml prevents significant urinary lactate excretion. The response of the trout kidney to true metabolic acidosis is similar to that of the mammalian kidney.</jats:p>",0

Insight into post‐mating interactions between the sexes: relatedness suppresses productivity of singly mated female <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract</jats:bold> Post‐mating, prefertilization inbreeding avoidance (PPIA) is well established in plants but not in animals. Support for animal PPIA comes from sperm competition studies showing success of a male's gametes declining with his relatedness to the multiply mated female; however, such studies confound female–male and male–male interaction. To avoid this problem, we investigated offspring productivity of singly mated <jats:italic>Drosophila melanogaster</jats:italic> females using flies from four different genetic backgrounds. Our experiments established that intrapopulation crosses using highly related parents (within‐strain) were significantly less productive than intrapopulation crosses using unrelated individuals from the same population (between‐strain). Furthermore, we showed that these effects were not due to inbreeding depression. The average decrease in offspring productivity of within‐strain crosses relative to between‐strain crosses was 18.3% [nonlaboratory populations: Zimbabwe 20.3%, Riverside 11.4%, neither of which showed inbreeding depression; and temperature‐adapted laboratory populations, uncorrected (corrected) for nonsignificant inbreeding depression: 18 °C, 26.5% (24.2%) and 29 °C, 20.1% (9.5%)]. The significant reduction of within‐cross productivity demonstrates PPIA in the absence of multiple mating.</jats:p>",0

Ultrastructural evidence for a role of γ‐aminobutyric acid in mediating the effects of corticotropin‐releasing factor on the rat dorsal raphe serotonin system,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin (5‐HT) system has been implicated in acute responses to stress and in stress‐related psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. Substantial findings suggest that the neuropeptide corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) is instrumental in modulating the activity of this system during stress. Because the DRN is neurochemically heterogeneous, dual immunoelectron microscopy was used to examine cellular substrates for interactions between CRF and either 5‐HT or γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the dorsolateral and ventromedial DRN. CRF immunoreactivity was identified primarily within axon terminals, where immunolabeling was particularly enriched in dense‐core vesicles. Although CRF terminals targeted 5‐HT‐containing dendrites in the dorsolateral DRN (16%; n = 251 terminals), synaptic contacts with dendrites that lacked detectable 5‐HT immunolabeling were more numerous (48%). In contrast, dual labeling for CRF and GABA (n = 240 terminals) in the dorsolateral DRN revealed that substantially more CRF terminals contacted GABA dendrites (42%) as opposed to unlabeled dendrites (29%). In the ventromedial DRN, contacts between CRF axon terminals and either 5‐HT‐labeled dendrites or GABA‐containing dendrites were fewer than in the dorsolateral DRN. As in the dorsolateral DRN, CRF terminals more frequently contacted GABA dendrites than 5‐HT dendrites (30% vs. 8%, respectively). The findings support physiological studies suggesting that CRF has both direct and indirect effects on DRN‐5‐HT neurons and further implicate GABA as a primary mediator by which CRF and stressors alter the activity of the DRN‐5‐HT system.

The Role of the Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Signaling Pathway in Mood Modulation,"<jats:p>The neurobiological underpinnings of mood modulation, molecular pathophysiology of manic-depressive illness, and therapeutic mechanism of mood stabilizers are largely unknown. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is activated by neurotrophins and other neuroactive chemicals to produce their effects on neuronal differentiation, survival, regeneration, and structural and functional plasticity. We found that lithium and valproate, commonly used mood stabilizers for the treatment of manic-depressive illness, stimulated the ERK pathway in the rat hippocampus and frontal cortex. Both drugs increased the levels of activated phospho-ERK44/42, activated phospho-ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (RSK1) (a substrate of ERK), phospho-CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and phospho-B cell lymphoma protein-2 antagonist of cell death (substrates of RSK), and BDNF. Inhibiting the ERK pathway with the blood-brain barrier-penetrating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)/ERK kinase (MEK) kinase inhibitor SL327, but not with the nonblood-brain barrier-penetrating MEK inhibitor U0126, decreased immobility time and increased swimming time of rats in the forced-swim test. SL327, but not U0126, also increased locomotion time and distance traveled in a large open field. The behavioral changes in the open field were prevented with chronic lithium pretreatment. SL327-induced behavioral changes are qualitatively similar to the changes induced by amphetamine, a compound that induces relapse in remitted manic patients and mood elevation in normal subjects. These data suggest that the ERK pathway may mediate the antimanic effects of mood stabilizers.</jats:p>",1

"Mechanism of force inhibition by 2,3‐butanedione monoxime in rat cardiac muscle: roles of [Ca2+]i and cross‐bridge kinetics.","<jats:p>1. We investigated the mechanism of force inhibition by 2,3‐butanedione monoxime (BDM) on rat cardiac trabeculae. [Ca2+]i was measured by iontophoretic injection of fura‐2 salt. Isometric force was recorded at an end‐systolic sarcomere length of 2.1‐2.2 microns. 2. With an external [Ca2+] of 1 mM, peak twitch force was monotonically reduced with increasing [BMD]; at 5 and 20 mM [BDM], force was 35 and 1% of the control force. In contrast, the mean peak [Ca2+]i during transients was only reduced at [BDM] &gt; or = 10 mM. 3. The duration of the twitch was dramatically reduced by BDM in a dose‐dependent fashion with no significant change in the time course of the underlying Ca2+ transients. The abbreviation of twitch force duration was much greater than expected for the observed reduction in peak force by this agent. 4. The mechanism of the inhibition of force by BDM was explored by examining the relationship between twitch force and Ca2+ transients at various values of external [Ca2+]. In the presence of BDM, the steepness of the relationship between peak force and peak [Ca2+]i was reduced compared to control conditions. As a result, significant elevation in the [Ca2+]i transient was unable to reverse the reduction in force observed in the presence of BDM. 5. The direct inhibitory effects of BDM on the contractile system were examined using ryanodine tetani in intact trabeculae to measure the steady‐state force‐[Ca2+]i relationship. In contrast to the effects on twitch force at 5 mM BDM, maximal force was only reduced to 71% of control. Furthermore, the [Ca2+]i required for half‐maximal activation (Ca50) was increased while the Hill coefficient was reduced slightly by BDM. 6. BDM dramatically slowed the rate of rise of tetanic force. At maximal activation, the time required to reach 90% maximal force was prolonged by a factor of 3‐8 in the presence of 5 mM BDM. This suggests that the observed reduction in twitch force and steady‐state force may result from slowed kinetics of cross‐bridge attachment, consistent with recent biochemical studies. 7. The contribution of altered cross‐bridge kinetics to the effects of BDM was investigated using a co‐operative cross‐bridge model of the contractile system. Changing the rate constants for cross‐bridge attachment in the model to mimic the reported biochemical effects of BDM reproduced the observed effects of BDM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</jats:p>",0
Nonsynaptic epileptogenesis in the mammalian hippocampus in vitro. II. Role of extracellular potassium,"<jats:p> The role of extracellular K+ (K+o) in nonsynaptic epileptogenesis induced in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices by lowering [Ca2]o was studied with K+-selective microelectrodes (KSMs). Extracellular field potentials and [K+]o were recorded simultaneously with 1-2 KSMs in the CA1 stratum pyramidale. In slices perfused with an oxygenated standard physiological solution (containing 2 mM Ca2+), base-line [K+]o was stable for several hours. The washout of Ca2+o was accompanied by a gradual tonic rise of [K+]o. Spontaneous and stimulus-evoked maximal seizurelike events (SLEs) appeared when [K+]o was approximately 0.5 mM above the initial 5 mM base line. These changes were reversible in normal medium. When K+o was pressure ejected in the CA1 stratum pyramidale of spontaneously active slices, a local rise in [K+]o of approximately 0.5 mM was necessary to trigger a SLE. A similar apparent [K+]o ""threshold"" was associated with SLEs evoked by electrical stimulation. Increasing [K+] in the perfusing solution by small increments (1 mM) markedly enhanced SLEs frequency and velocity of spread and decreased the period of absolute refractoriness that succeeded each paroxysm. Similar changes occurred during periods of transient hypoxia. Small [K+] decreases in the perfusate had the converse effects. Spontaneous SLEs were associated with phasic increases in [K+]o. In simultaneous [K+]o recordings from two layers, these transients were largest (up to 3.5 mM above base line) and rose more steeply at the stratum pyramidale. Toward the outer dendritic layers they became smaller, slower in time course, and delayed in onset. We conclude that the main source for these [K+]o transients are the hippocampal pyramidal cell bodies, which discharge intensely during a SLE, and that excess K+o is spatially dispersed around the discharge zone of the paroxysm. [K+]o continued to rise, though at a slower rate, throughout the course of a SLE. Following SLE termination, [K+]o decayed slowly to base line. The invasion of a CA1 region by a propagating SLE was preceded quite often by a slow rise in [K+]o. A sudden transition to a steeply rising [K+]o marked the explosive recruitment of this region into the discharge zone of the spreading paroxysm. The total (tonic and phasic) increase in [K+]o during SLEs did not surpass a maximal level of approximately 9 mM, which was the ceiling level of [K+]o in low [Ca2+]o. However, when spreading depression occurred, [K+]o rose up to 30-40 mM for several minutes. Spreading depression rarely appeared spontaneously despite the recurrence of SLEs, but could be provoked by repetitive electrical stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </jats:p>",0

Structure of the mitochondrial creatine kinase octamer: high-resolution shadowing and image averaging of single molecules and formation of linear filaments under specific staining conditions.,"<jats:p>The combination of high-resolution tantalum/tungsten (Ta/W) shadowing at very low specimen temperature (-250 degrees C) under ultrahigh vacuum (less than 2 x 10(-9) mbar) with circular harmonic image averaging revealed details on the surface structure of mitochondrial creatine kinase (Mi-CK) molecules with a resolution less than 2.5 nm. Mi-CK octamers exhibit a cross-like surface depression dividing the square shaped projection of 10 x 10 nm into four equally sized subdomains, which correspond to the four dimers forming the octameric Mi-CK molecule. By a combination of positive staining (with uranyl acetate) and heavy metal shadowing, internal structures as well as the surface relief of Mi-CK were visualized at the same time at high resolution. Computational image analysis revealed only a single projection class of molecules, but the ability of Mi-CK to form linear filaments, as well as geometrical considerations concerning the formation of octamers by four equal, asymmetric dimers, suggest the existence of at least two distinct faces on the molecule. By image processing of Mi-CK filaments a side view of the octamer differing from the top-bottom projections of single molecules became evident showing a funnel-like access each form the top and bottom of the octamer connected by a central channel. The general structure of the Mi-CK octamer described here is relevant to the localization of the molecule at the inner-outer mitochondrial contact sites and to the function of Mi-CK as an ""energy channeling"" molecule.</jats:p>",0

Electroconvulsive Seizures Inhibit Amygdala Kindling: Implications for Mechanisms of Action in Affective Illness,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p><jats:bold>Summary: </jats:bold> Amygdala kindling, the progressive development of seizures following repeated electrical stimulation, has been used as a model of epilepto‐genesis, neural memory, and the development of behavioral alterations. In an attempt to interfere with the kindling process, electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) were administered 6 h prior to or immediately after once‐daily amygdala stimulation. ECS compared with sham ECS 6 h prior to kindling profoundly inhibited the development of amygdala‐kindled seizures, while ECS immediately after the afterdischarge (AD) were not effective. In a second study, seven daily ECS, but not a single ECS followed by a 6‐day delay, markedly suppressed established amygdala‐kindled seizures compared with sham ECS controls. The generalized seizures of ECS thus appear to be paradoxically anticonvulsant to limbic seizures. Carbamazepine, a potent anticonvulsant for temporal lobe and limbic seizures in animals and man, inhibits amygdala‐kindled seizures and is effective in the treatment of manic‐depressive illness. The current findings suggest the possibility that the efficacy of ECS in affective illness may be, in part, related to its limbic antikindling and anticonvulsant effects.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESUMEN</jats:title><jats:p>El condicionamiento de la amígdala (kindling), es decir, el pro‐gresivo desarrollo de ataques tras la estimulación eléctrica re‐petida, ha sido usado como un modelo de epileptogénesis, me‐moria neuronal y del desarrollo de alleraciones del comporta‐miento.

Histidinemia Produced in the Rat by Treatment with Nitromethane,"<jats:p>Metabolic effects of &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;administration of nitromethane, a histidase inhibitor, were studied in the rat. Histidinemia produced by feeding a 5-percent histidine diet to the rat was included for comparison. Rats injected subcutaneously with nitromethane every other day appeared to be histidinemic, with a plasma histidine level of 43 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;mol/100 ml (control 9.2 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;mol/100 ml) after 12 days of treatment. Histidine concentrations in the brain, liver, kidney, and urine of the nitromethane-treated rats were also increased. Liver histidase activity was decreased about 75 % after nitromethane administration, and the rate of &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production from histidine was also depressed. No abnormal change in liver and kidney sizes was observed in these animals. Rats fed the 5-percent histidine diet showed markedly higher plasma histidine concentrations (99 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;mol/100 ml) than the nitromethane-treated rats. The magnitude of increase in plasma histidine in the histidine-fed rats was considerably greater than that observed in humans with histidinemia. Furthermore, the liver histidase activity was decreased only by about 20 %, and a significant increase in liver and kidney sizes was noted in the histidine-fed animals. These findings indicate that histidinemia produced by nitromethane administration is a better model for studies of the genetic disorder than histidinemia induced by high levels of histidine in the diet.</jats:p>",0

Autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with severe anti-TNF refractory Crohn disease: long-term follow-up,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>We evaluated the safety and clinical outcome of autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with severe Crohn disease (CD) defined as a Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) greater than 250, and/or Crohn Severity Index greater than 16 despite anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy. Stem cells were mobilized from the peripheral blood using cyclophosphamide (2.0 g/m2) and G-CSF (10 μg/kg/day), enriched ex vivo by CD34+ selection, and reinfused after immune suppressive conditioning with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and either equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG, 90 mg/kg) or rabbit ATG (6 mg/kg). Eighteen of 24 patients are 5 or more years after transplantation. All patients went into remission with a CDAI less than 150. The percentage of clinical relapse-free survival defined as the percent free of restarting CD medical therapy after transplantation is 91% at 1 year, 63% at 2 years, 57% at 3 years, 39% at 4 years, and 19% at 5 years. The percentage of patients in remission (CDAI &lt; 150), steroid-free, or medication-free at any posttransplantation evaluation interval more than 5 years after transplantation has remained at or greater than 70%, 80%, and 60%, respectively. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT0027853.</jats:p>",0

The effect of different doses of <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">AP</jats:styled-content> (1.2 and 2.5 IU/mL) on several sperm parameters after <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IVC</jats:styled-content> (viability, acrosome integrity with <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">FITC</jats:styled-content>‐<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PSA</jats:styled-content>, capacitation status with <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">CTC</jats:styled-content> staining, tyrosine phosphorylation) and on fertilizing ability during <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IVF</jats:styled-content> were also evaluated. High <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">AP</jats:styled-content> activity was detected in seminal plasma, in particular in sperm‐rich fraction; a lower activity was detected in uncapacitated spermatozoa while a significant decrease was evidenced after <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IVC</jats:styled-content>. Viability was not changed by <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">AP</jats:styled-content> supplementation of the capacitating medium, whereas acrosome integrity and capacitation status were significantly affected by 1.2 and 2.5 doses, with a dose‐dependent decrease in acrosome‐reacted cells as well as in <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">CTC</jats:styled-content> B pattern displaying cells. As for sperm head protein phosphorylation, a decrease in relative fluorescence was detected in <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">AP</jats:styled-content> 2.5 group, if compared with capacitated one. After <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IVF</jats:styled-content>, a dose‐dependent decrease in penetrated oocytes was recorded, with an increase in monospermic zygote rate. In conclusion, we demonstrated that <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">AP</jats:styled-content> activity decreases under capacitating condition and that addition of <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">AP</jats:styled-content> to spermatozoa during capacitation results in a depression of the capacitating process and <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IVF</jats:styled-content>.

Sphingomyelinase depresses force and calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus in mouse diaphragm muscle fibers,"<jats:p>Diseases that result in muscle weakness, e.g., heart failure, are characterized by elevated sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity. In intact muscle, SMase increases oxidants that contribute to diminished muscle force. However, the source of oxidants, specific processes of muscle contraction that are dysfunctional, and biochemical changes underlying the weakness elicited by SMase remain unknown. We tested three hypotheses: 1) SMase-induced depression of muscle force is mediated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2) SMase depresses force and calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, and 3) SMase promotes oxidation and phosphorylation of myofibrillar proteins. Our experiments included intact muscle bundles, permeabilized single fibers, and isolated myofibrillar proteins. The mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant d-Arg-2′,6′-dimethyl-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, decreased cytosolic oxidants and protected intact muscle bundles from weakness stimulated by SMase. SMase depressed maximal calcium-activated force by 20% in permeabilized single fibers (in kN/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>: control 117 ± 6; SMase 93 ± 8; P &lt; 0.05). Calcium sensitivity of permeabilized single fibers decreased from 5.98 ± 0.03 (control) to 5.91 ± 0.02 (SMase; P &lt; 0.05). Myofibrillar protein nitrotyrosines, carbonyls, and phosphorylation were unaltered by SMase. Our study shows that the fall in specific force of intact muscle elicited by SMase is mediated by mitochondrial ROS and can be attributed largely to dysfunction of the contractile apparatus.</jats:p>",0

Bioenergetic Recovery following Ischemia in Brain Slices Studied by <sup>31</sup>P-NMR Spectroscopy: Differential Age Effect of Depolarization Mediated by Endogenous Nitric Oxide,"<jats:p> Proximate neurotoxic mechanisms during postischemic recovery may be influenced by stage of development and complicating factors such as cortical spreading depression or secondary brain insult. Using <jats:sup>31</jats:sup>P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have monitored pH and cellular energy metabolites phosphocreatine (PCr) and ATP in the ex vivo rat cerebral cortex before, during, and after substrate and oxygen deprivation, which represents “in vitro ischemia.” There were important developmental differences in resistance and response to an ischemic insult. Twenty-one-day-old (P21) rat cortical slices had no detectable β-ATP or PCr at the end of a 20-min insult, while γ-day-old (P7) slices had 50 ± 13.7% (mean ± SD, n = 12) and 17 ± 14.8% relative to preischemia levels, respectively. Postischemic depolarization resulted in age-dependent effects on PCr (p &lt; 0.05): In the older tissue, depolarization significantly worsened the recovery of PCr, whereas in young tissue it ameliorated recovery. This amelioration could be prevented by inhibiting nitric oxide production with methylene blue (depolarization-methylene blue interaction, p &lt; 0.05) and enhanced by administration of the nitric oxide donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN; p &lt; 0.01). However, in P21 tissue, GTN further exacerbated injury (age-GTN interaction, p &lt; 0.01). Therefore, in this vascular-independent preparation, a neuronal or glial nitric oxide-dependent mechanism appears to confer improved postischemic bioenergetic recovery in the developing brain compared with the mature brain. </jats:p>",0

The Effect of Mitomycin C on Antigenic and Mitogenic Stimulation of Mouse Lymphocytes In Vitro,"<jats:p>The effect of mitomycin C on DNA synthesis and plaque formation in mouse spleen cells was studied in vitro, with special reference to the synergistic effect observed between some antigens and mitogens on lymphocyte stimulation. Mitomycin C inhibited DNA synthesis in doses that did not cause an extensive cell death It blocked almost completely a primary plaque‐forming cell response to sheep erythrocytes (SRC) and, to a great extent, PPD‐induced antibody synthesis detected against SRC. The synergistic effect earlier observed in vitro between SRC and PPD was not abolished in cultures where replication of DNA was depressed. Simultaneous stimulation with SRC and PPD in cultures treated with mitomycin C allows an estimation of the number of antigen‐sensitive cells to SRC that are stimulated to antibody synthesis without prior cell division.</jats:p>",0

CSD events were identified by decreased EEG amplitude and DC potential shift. Additional unanesthetized sumatriptan or saline-pretreated rats were exposed to bright light environmental stress and periorbital and hindpaw withdrawal thresholds were measured.

Moreover, CSD and environmental stress increased Fos expression in the TNC of sumatriptan-treated rats, and these effects were blocked by topiramate. Environmental stress did not elicit cutaneous allodynia or elevate TNC Fos expression in saline-treated rats. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p> A previous period of sumatriptan exposure produced long-lasting increased susceptibility to evoked CSD and environmental stress-induced activation of the TNC that was prevented by topiramate.

"The Mechanisms of Inhibition of Frog Endplate Currents With Homologous Derivatives of the 1,1-dimethyl-3-oxybutyl Phosphonic Acid","<jats:p>The mode of inhibition of endplate currents by four esters of 1,1-dimethyl-3-oxybutyl phosphonic acid with different lipophilicities and molecule lengths were estimated by mathematical modeling based on previous electrophysiological data supplemented by several experiments with rhythmic stimulation. The aim was to discriminate between their receptor and non-receptor effects. It was shown that all esters have a two-component mechanism of depression: inhibition of the receptor open channel and allosteric modulation of the receptor-channel complex. The ratio of both functional components depends on the length and lipophilicity of the esters. Short and less lipophilic esters mostly act as open channel inhibitors and the rate of inhibition substantially depends on the rate of stimulation, i. e. probability of the receptor-channel opening. As the length of the ester radicals and their lipophilicity increased, these compounds were more active as allosteric receptor inhibitors, probably hindering the function of nAChRs from the lipid annulus.</jats:p>",0

Heterogeneity of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors in the Striatum: Electrophysiological Evidence,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In order to investigate the functional role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the striatum we performed extracellular and intracellular recordings from a corticostriatal brain slice preparation. The effects of <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>‐2‐amino‐3‐phosphopropionic acid (<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>‐AP3), an antagonist of mGluRs, were studied both on long‐term synaptic depression (LTD) and on presynaptic inhibition of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) induced by different agonists of mGluRs. <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>‐AP3 produced a dose‐dependent (3 – 30 μM) reduction of the LTD evoked in the striatum by the tetanic stimulation of the corticostriatal pathway.

Higher concentrations of <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>‐AP3 (0.3 – 1 mM) reduced by themselves the EPSP amplitude. The inhibitory effect of <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>‐ACPD on the cortically evoked EPSPs was mimicked either by the active stereoisomer 1S,3R‐ACPD or by amino‐4‐phosphonobutyric acid (<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>‐AP4), a glutamate autoreceptor agonist. In some neurons, these inhibitory actions were coupled with membrane depolarizations. The depression of synaptic transmission caused by <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>‐ACPD, 1S,3R‐ACPD and <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>‐AP4 was not altered following the induction of LTD. Chronic lithium treatment of the animals (60–120 mg/kg i.p. for 10 days) blocked striatal LTD but not presynaptic inhibition mediated by mGluR agonists. The present findings show that the mechanisms underlying LTD and the presynaptic inhibition induced by different agonists of mGluRs exhibit functional and pharmacological differences. These data suggest heterogeneity of mGluRs in the striatum.</jats:p>",0

Order-Dependent Coincidence Detection in Cerebellar Purkinje Neurons at the Inositol Trisphosphate Receptor,"<jats:p>Associative long-term depression (LTD) at cerebellar parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses is sensitive to the temporal order in which the parallel fiber is coactivated with the climbing fiber input, but how order sensitivity is achieved is unknown. Here we show that the cerebellar inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) receptor, whose activation is required for LTD induction, is sensitive<jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>to the order of presentation of its coagonists, IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>and cytoplasmic calcium. By focally photolyzing a novel caged IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>compound in dendritic spines, we find that pairing IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>with climbing fiber-mediated calcium entry leads to a large calcium release transient if the climbing fiber is activated up to 100 ms before or up to 500 ms after IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>uncaging. This asymmetric timing window for coactivation follows the kinetics of calcium removal and IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>unbinding from the receptor and is not limited by IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>metabolism. IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>receptor binding thus acts as an eligibility trace that can drive temporal order-dependent calcium release and LTD induction in Purkinje cells and event order-dependent sensory plasticity in the whole animal.</jats:p>",0

According to the <jats:italic>complementary genes hypothesis</jats:italic>, females mate with <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> dissimilar males to enhance the immunocompetence of their offspring or to avoid inbreeding depression. Here, we investigate whether selection favours a preference for maximally dissimilar or optimally dissimilar <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> class I types, based on <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> genotypes, average amino acid distances and the functional properties of the antigen‐binding sites (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> supertypes); and whether <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> type dissimilarity predicts relatedness between mates in a wild great tit population. In particular, we explore the role that <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> class I plays in female mate choice decisions while controlling for relatedness and spatial population structure, and examine the reproductive fitness consequences of <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> compatibility between mates. We find no evidence for the hypotheses that females select mates on the basis of either maximal or optimal <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> class I dissimilarity. A weak correlation between <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> supertype sharing and relatedness suggests that <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> dissimilarity at functional variants may not provide an effective index of relatedness. Moreover, the reproductive success of pairs did not vary with <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MHC</jats:styled-content> dissimilarity.

Calcium Waves Precede Electrophysiological Changes of Spreading Depression in Hippocampal Organ Cultures,"<jats:p>Although intercellular Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>waves resemble spreading depression (SD) and occur in hippocampal organ cultures (HOTCs), SD has not been reported in these cultures. Accordingly, electrophysiological and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>imaging techniques were used to examine potential interrelations between Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>waves and electrophysiological changes of SD. Our results show, for the first time, that HOTCs can support SD. Furthermore, two distinct Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>waves were found to precede SD. The first traveled &gt;100 μm/sec along the pyramidal cell dendritic layer. The second subsequently traveled mostly perpendicular to the pyramidal cell layer from CA3 (or CA1) but also in all directions from its area of initiation. This second, slower wave spread with the interstitial DC change of SD at millimeters per minute but always ahead of it by 6–16 sec. Heptanol, which uncouples gap junctions, blocked both of these Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>waves and SD. Thus, two types of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>waves occur with the initiation and propagation of SD. The first might reflect interneuronal changes linked by gap junctions, whereas the second might stem from interastrocyte changes linked via similar connections. Because individual cells can be followed in space and time for protracted periods in HOTCs, this preparation may be ideal for studies designed to explore not only the mechanisms of SD but also the long-term consequences of SD, such as ischemic tolerance.</jats:p>",0

Adenosine pre- and postsynaptic modulation of glutamate-dependent calcium activity in hypothalamic neurons,"<jats:p> 1. Within the hypothalamus, adenosine has been reported to influence temperature regulation, sleep homeostasis, and endocrine secretions. The effects of adenosine on hypothalamic neurons have not been studied at the cellular level. Adenosine (5 nM-30 microM) showed no influence on intracellular Ca2+ or electrical activity in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; consequently, we examined the role of adenosine in modulating the activity of glutamate in cultured hypothalamic neurons (n &gt; 1,700) with fura-2 Ca2+ digital imaging and whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in the absence of glutamate receptor block. 2. When glutamate receptors were not blocked, adenosine (1-30 microM) and the selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyl adenosine (CPA; 5 nM-1 microM) caused a large reduction in intracellular Ca2+ and electrical activity, suggesting that glutamate neurotransmission was critical for an effect of adenosine to be detected. Neuronal Ca2+ levels were reversibly depressed by CPA (50 nM), with a maximum depression of 90%, and these effects were blocked by coadministration of the A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). 3. Ca2+ levels in immature neurons before the time of synaptogenesis were not affected by adenosine. Adenosine A1 receptor activation suppressed glutamate-mediated Ca2+ activity in neurons in vitro 8 to 73 days. 4. Adenosine (1 or 10 microM) caused a hyperpolarization of membrane potential and a reduction of large postsynaptic potentials arising from endogenously released glutamate. The administration of low concentrations of CPA (5 nM) decreased the frequency of glutamate-mediated, neuronally synchronized Ca2+ transients and the frequency of postsynaptic potentials. 5. To compare the relative effects of adenosine on hypothalamic neurons with cells from other brain regions, we assayed the effects of CPA on glutamate-mediated Ca2+ in hippocampal and cortical cultures. CPA (50 nM) reversibly depressed glutamate-mediated Ca2+ rises in hypothalamic neurons by 35%, compared with 54% in hippocampal neurons and 46% in cortical neurons. 6. If it does play a functional role, adenosine should be released by hypothalamic cells. In some neurons the adenosine A1 receptor antagonists cyclopentyltheophylline or DPCPX caused an increase in intracellular Ca2+, suggesting that adenosine was secreted by hypothalamic cells, tonically depressing glutamate-enhanced neuronal Ca2+. 7. To determine whether adenosine could exert a postsynaptic effect, we coapplied it with glutamate agonists in the presence of tetrodotoxin. Within subpopulations of hypothalamic neurons, adenosine and CPA either inhibited (18% of total neurons) or potentiated (6% of total neurons) responses to glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and kainate by &gt; or = 20%. 8. In contrast to the modest effects found in neurons, responses of hypothalamic astrocytes to the application of glutamate or the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist (+/-)-trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid were strongly potentiated by adenosine (mean +225%) and CPA. 9. Together, these findings suggest that adenosine exerts a major presynaptic effect and a minor postsynaptic effect in the modulation of glutamate neurotransmission in the hypothalamus, where it can play a significant role in blocking a large part of the glutamate-induced Ca2+ rise. In the absence of glutamate transmission, adenosine has relatively little effect on either neuronal intracellular Ca2+ or electrical activity. </jats:p>",0

"Attachment, Social Support, and Responses following the Death of a Companion Animal","<jats:p> This research tested hypotheses concerning attachment, social support, and grief responses to the loss of animal companionship. Participants whose companion cat or dog had recently died ( N = 429) completed the Attachment Style Questionnaire, the Inventory of Complicated Grief, and the Multidimensional Health Profile-Psychosocial Functioning questionnaires. Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were found to be positively associated with respondents' grief, depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Social support was found to be negatively associated with these outcomes as well as with attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. In multiple regression analyses, attachment anxiety incrementally predicted grief, anxiety and somatic symptoms, attachment avoidance incrementally predicted grief and depression, and social support incrementally predicted all outcomes. Interaction effects of attachment and social support in relation to outcomes were not found. The present study's implications and limitations are discussed, as are directions for future research. </jats:p>",0

Blood-brain barrier breach following cortical contusion in the rat,"<jats:p content-type=""fine-print"">✓ Adult Fisher 344 rats were subjected to a unilateral impact to the dorsal cortex above the hippocampus at 3.5 m/second, resulting in a 2-mm cortical depression. This caused severe cortical damage and neuronal loss in hippocampus subfields CA1, CA3, and hilus. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was assessed by injecting the protein horseradish peroxidase (HRP) 5 minutes prior to or at various times after injury (5 minutes, 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours, 1, 2, 5, and 10 days). Animals were killed 1 hour after HRP injection and brain sections were reacted with diaminobenzidine to visualize extravascular accumulation of the protein. Maximum staining occurred in animals injected with HRP 5 minutes prior to or 5 minutes after cortical contusion. Staining at these time points was observed in the ipsilateral cortex of the impact area and areas adjacent to it, as well as in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Some modest staining occurred in the dorsal contralateral cortex near the superior sagittal sinus. Cortical HRP staining gradually decreased at increasing time intervals postinjury. By 10 days, no HRP staining was observed in any area of the brain. In the ipsilateral hippocampus, HRP staining was absent by 3 hours postinjury and remained so at the 6- and 12-hour time points. Surprisingly, HRP staining was again observed in the ipsilateral hippocampus 1 and 2 days after cortical contusion, indicating a biphasic opening of the BBB following head trauma and a possible second wave of secondary brain damage days after the contusion injury. These data indicate that regions not initially destroyed by cortical impact, but evidencing BBB breach, may be accessible to neurotrophic factors administered intravenously both immediately and days after brain trauma.</jats:p>",0

Effects of High Doses of Peptichemio upon the Humoral Response to Sheep Erythrocytes and Delayed Hypersensitivity Reactions to Oxazolone in Cba Mice,"<jats:p> A study has been carried out on the immunosuppressive activity of high doses of peptichemio (PTC) in CBA mice. Humoral response to sheep erythrocytes, delayed hypersensitivity to oxazolone, and cellular proliferation in lymph nodes and spleen of animals sensitized with oxazolone have been investigated. The results demonstrated that PTC had a definite immunosuppressive action, as shown by the inhibition of primary response to inoculation of sheep erythrocytes, by depression of delayed hypersensitivity to oxazolone, and by marked inhibition of <jats:sup>125</jats:sup>IUdr incorporation in lymph nodes of sensitized animals. It is suggested that the inhibitory action is mediated by an effect on actively proliferating B or T lymphoid cells, although involvement of macrophages cannot be ruled out. </jats:p>",0

beta-Adrenergic activity and cardiovascular response to severe respiratory acidosis,"<jats:p> The mechanism responsible for the depressive myocardial effects of severe respiratory acidosis is unclear; however, sympathetic stimulation and catecholamines are known to be involved. The influence of beta-adrenergic receptor activity on the myocardial response to severe respiratory acidosis was studied in 18 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs. Arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) was raised by increasing the inspired CO2 fraction in O2. In control animals, as PaCO2 increased, heart rate (HR) decreased (PaCO2 approximately 110 mmHg), then returned to control (PaCO2 approximately 220 mmHg), whereas arterial blood pressure (Pa) and cardiac output (Q) remained unchanged from prehypercapnia levels. At PaCO2 greater than 350 mmHg, Pa, HR, and Q decreased and left ventricular function (LVF) curves were depressed. Death occurred at a PaCO2 of 404 +/- 25 mmHg (pH 6.48 +/- 0.02). In a second group of animals, administration of isoproterenol during the increase in PaCO2 did not result in depression of myocardial function, and death did not occur even at a significantly higher PaCO2 (PaCO2 496 +/- 12 mmHg; pH 6.39 +/- 0.02) than in the control group. Administration of propranolol to a third group of animals as PaCO2 increased did not change Pa, HR, and Q; however, LVF curves indicated a more rapid and severe depression of myocardial performance than in control, and death occurred at a significantly lower PaCO2 (PaCO2 220 +/- 25 mmHg; pH 6.65 +/- 0.02). We conclude that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation can prevent hypercapnic heart failure and that beta-adrenergic receptor activity is involved in the mechanism responsible for this failure. </jats:p>",0
Metaplastic control of the endocannabinoid system at inhibitory synapses in hippocampus,"<jats:p>
            The modifiability of neuronal response plasticity is called “metaplasticity.” In suppressing synaptic inhibition and facilitating induction of long-term excitatory synaptic plasticity, endocannabinoids (eCBs) act as agents of metaplasticity. We now report the discovery of a calcium-dependent mechanism that regulates eCB mobilization by metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation. The switch-like mechanism primes cells to release eCBs and requires a transient rise in intracellular Ca

Metabotropic glutamate receptors modulate feedback inhibition in a developmentally regulated manner in rat dentate gyrus,"<jats:p>We investigated group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) modulation of glutamatergic input onto hilar‐border interneurones and its regulation of feedback inhibition in the dentate gyrus. Selective activation of group II mGluRs with (2<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>,2′<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>,3′<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>)‐2‐(2′,3′‐dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG‐IV) depressed mossy fibre (MF)‐evoked excitatory drive to these interneurones with significantly greater depression in juvenile than adult rats. During 20 Hz MF stimulus trains, EPSCs became depressed. Depression during the early, but not later part of the train was significantly greater in juvenile than adult rats and was blocked by the mGluR antagonist (2<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>)‐2‐amino‐2‐[(1<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>,2<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>)‐2‐carboxycycloprop‐1‐yl]‐3‐(xanth‐9‐yl) propanoic acid (LY341495). In dentate granule cells from juvenile rats polysynaptic feedback IPSCs, but not monosynaptic IPSCs, were strongly suppressed by DCG‐IV. DCG‐IV also suppressed feedback inhibition of perforant path‐evoked population spikes. In contrast, in adult animals DCG‐IV did not significantly depress feedback inhibition. During 20 Hz stimulus trains in juvenile animals the summation of polysynaptic, but not monosynaptic IPSCs was suppressed by synaptically activated group II mGluRs. Blockade of these mGluRs with LY341495 significantly increased the area and duration of the summated IPSC, causing greater feedback inhibition of granule cell firing. In contrast, in adult animals LY341495 did not alter feedback inhibition following the stimulus train. These findings indicate that group II mGluRs modulate excitatory drive to interneurones in a developmentally regulated manner and thereby modulate feedback inhibition in the dentate gyrus.</jats:p>",0

The immune response to allogeneic rat platelets; Ag‐B antigens in matrix form lacking la,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Allogeneic rat platelets fail to induce either primary antibody or cell‐mediated immune responses despite repeated injections. Platelets bear Ag‐B epitopes which are capable of being recognized by antigen‐reactive T and B cells since primed rats develop secondary responses after challenge with allogeneic platelets. The secondary responses induced decrease rather than increase on repeated injection of platelets. Repeated injection of allogeneic platelets into nonprimed rats leads to a state of specific, partial non‐reactivity; recipients given such treatment show marked depression of cytotoxic antibody responses, but normal cellular immunity after challenge with viable lymphoid cells taken from the platelet‐donor strain. Injection of normal rats with allogeneic platelets mixed with 3rd party, viable lymphoid cells, does not provoke an anti‐platelet Ag‐B antibody response.</jats:p>",0

"Jumping mechanisms in dictyopharid planthoppers (<i>Hemiptera, Dicytyopharidae</i>)","<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The jumping performance of four species of hemipteran bugs belonging to the family Dictyopharidae, from Europe, South Africa and Australia were analysed from high speed images. The body shape in all was characterised by an elongated and tapering head that gave a streamlined appearance. The body size ranged from 6-9 mm in length and 6-23 mg in mass. The hind legs were 80-90 % of body length and 30-50% longer than the front legs, except in one species in which the front legs were particularly large so that all the legs were of similar lengths. Jumping was propelled by rapid and simultaneous depression of the trochantera of both hind legs, powered by large muscles in the thorax and was accompanied by extension of the tibiae. In the best jumps, defined as those with the fastest take-off velocity, Engela accelerated in 1.2 ms to a take-off velocity of 5.8 m s-1 which is the fastest achieved by any insect so far described. During such a jump, Engela experienced an acceleration of 4830 m s-2 or 490 g while other species in the same family experienced 225 - 375 g. The best jumps in all species required an energy expenditure of 76 - 225 μJ, a power output of 12 - 80 mW and exerted a force of 12 - 29 mN. The required power output per mass of jumping muscle ranged from 28000 - 140200 W kg-1 muscle and thus greatly exceeded the maximum active contractile limit of normal muscle. To achieve such a jumping performance, these insects must be using a power amplification mechanism in a catapult-like action. It is suggested that their streamlined body shape improves jumping performance by reducing drag, which for a small insect, can substantially affect forward momentum.</jats:p>",0
Effect of chronic chromium picolinate in animal models of anxiety and memory,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Diabetes mellitus is associated with certain neurological problems such as depression, anxiety, memory impairment, etc. As chromium picolinate (CrP), a widely used trace element is shown to have beneficial effects in diabetes and depression, we investigated its effects on elevated plus maze and spontaneous alternation behavior paradigm as a measure of anxiety and memory, respectively. CrP (8 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>g/mL in drinking water) significantly increased percentage preference to open arm in elevated plus maze in diabetic and normal rats. However, no significant changes were observed in percentage alternation after CrP chronic treatment. The possible anxiolytic effect of CrP might be related to its effect on serotonergic transmission.</jats:p>",0

Abolition of a viscerosomatic reflex during oxygen deprivation,"<jats:p> Effect of hypoxia was studied on the J reflex, a term used for the reflex inhibition of muscular exercise by activation of type J pulmonary endings. Hypoxia was induced by ventilating the animal with gas mixtures varying from 18 to 9% oxygen in nitrogen. The blood gas tensions of the arterial blood (PaO2) were measured before, during, and after hypoxia. It was found that the J reflex is sensitive to a reduction in oxygen. A fall in PaO2 between 67 and 47 Torr abolished this reflex. Studies were also undertaken to exclude the possibility that the effect of hypoxia was predominantly exerted on monosynaptic reflex itself. A similar fall in PaO2 also depressed the monosynaptic reflex. Minimum time required for the significant depression was 32 s. On the contrary the J reflex was abolished within this period suggesting that the abolition of J reflex is independent of the changes in monosynaptic reflex during hypoxia. </jats:p>",0
Analysis of the murine 5‐HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor gene promoter <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The expression level of the 5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub> receptor gene (<jats:italic>htr1a</jats:italic>) in the central nervous system (CNS) is implicated in the aetiology and treatment of anxiety disorders and depression. Previous studies of the murine <jats:italic>htr1a</jats:italic> have revealed that its proximal promoter is GC rich and TATA‐less. Several functional transcription factor binding sites, including MAZ and SP1 recognition sequences, have been identified. To further analyse the promoter of this receptor gene, additional upstream sequence information extending to −5.5 kb of the murine <jats:italic>htr1a</jats:italic> was generated and promoter fragments extending to −20 kb were analysed for activity in cell culture and transgenic animals. Promoter fragments greater than 4.5 kb in length were active in 5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub> receptor mRNA positive cells and inactive in 5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub> receptor mRNA negative cells. Smaller fragments were not able to confer this specificity. In agreement, using additive transgenesis to drive <jats:italic>LacZ</jats:italic> expression <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>, CNS specific reporter gene expression was found with these longer constructs. Transgene expression in the 4.5‐ and 20‐kb mouse lines resembled the endogenous <jats:italic>htr1a</jats:italic> expression pattern, whereas the 5.5‐kb mouse lines surprisingly revealed strongly reduced expression. None of the three constructs was prone to confer ectopic expression, however, variation of expression between the transgenic lines was observed. Using colocalization studies we analysed the degree of concurrence of transgenic and endogenous <jats:italic>htr1a</jats:italic> expression brought about by these three different constructs. The highest degrees of colocalization were observed in mice harbouring the 20‐kb construct, suggesting a large promoter fragment is required to faithfully direct transgene expression in a 5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub> receptor like pattern.</jats:p>",0
Activation of CB1 specifically located on GABAergic interneurons inhibits LTD in the lateral amygdala,"<jats:p>Previously, we found that in the lateral amygdala (LA) of the mouse, WIN55,212-2 decreases both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission via activation of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), yet produces an overall reduction of neuronal excitability. This suggests that the effects on excitatory transmission override those on inhibitory transmission. Here we show that CB1 activation by WIN55,212-2 and Δ<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>-THC inhibits long-term depression (LTD) of basal synaptic transmission in the LA, induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS; 900 pulses/1 Hz). The CB1 agonist WIN55,212-2 blocked LTD via G<jats:sub>i/o</jats:sub> proteins, activation of inwardly rectifying K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> channels (K<jats:sub>ir</jats:sub>s), inhibition of the adenylate cyclase-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, and PKA-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated N-type Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> channels (N-type VGCCs). Interestingly, WIN55,212-2 effects on LTD were abolished in CB1 knock-out mice (CB1-KO), and in conditional mutants lacking CB1 expression only in GABAergic interneurons, but were still present in mutants lacking CB1 in principal forebrain neurons. LTD induction per se was unaffected by the CB1 antagonist SR141716A and was normally expressed in CB1-KO as well as in both conditional CB1 mutants. Our data demonstrate that activation of CB1 specifically located on GABAergic interneurons inhibits LTD in the LA. These findings suggest that CB1 expressed on either glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons play a differential role in the control of synaptic transmission and plasticity.</jats:p>",0

Effects of Estrogen on Platelet Reactivity After Transient Forebrain Ischemia in Rats,"<jats:p> Estrogen’s prothrombotic effects are of increasing concern, particularly in stroke risk and recovery. Using an ischemic rodent model, the authors sought to determine (a) if estrogen replacement increases postischemic platelet reactivity, (b) if changes in estrogen status alter intraplatelet endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) synthesis, and (c) if estrogen-mediated effects on platelets alter cerebral blood flow during reperfusion. Intact (I), ovariectomized (OVX), and OVX + 17 β -estradiol (E50) rats were subjected to 30 min of forebrain ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. Using the platelet activation marker P-selectin, postischemic platelet reactivity was quantified by flow cytometry. In a separate cohort (I, OVX, E50), the authors quantified platelet eNOS by Western blot. Another cohort (OVX, E50) was subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, and cerebral blood flow was determined using the iodoantipyrine technique. Collagen-stimulated platelet P-selectin expression was increased in the OVX rats at 60 min of reperfusion, and this effect was reversed by estrogen treatment. No differences in platelet eNOS expression were detected among groups. Cerebral blood flow at 60 min reperfusion was comparable between the OVX and the E50 rats. The authors conclude that during reper-fusion, estrogen deficiency increases postischemic platelet sensitivity to stimuli in estrogen-deficient rats. Estrogen treatment mitigates effects of estrogen loss on platelets, but this early effect is apparently not caused by intraplatelet eNOS depression. Neither estrogen deficiency nor estrogen treatment changes early postischemic regional brain blood flow. In this rodent global cerebral ischemic model, physiologic doses of estrogen are not deleterious to platelet reactivity and may initially reduce postischemic platelet reactivity. </jats:p>",0

Effects of an LHRH Agonist Analog upon Sexual Function in Male Dogs,"<jats:p>Male beagle dogs were injected once daily with 10 μg/ kg of [6‐D‐(2‐naphthyl)alanine]‐LHRH (D‐Nal(2)<jats:sup>6</jats:sup>‐LHRH), a potent LHRH agonist, for periods up to 42 days, with recovery periods up to 172 days. Blood samples collected at regular intervals were assayed for LH, FSH, and testosterone; total ejaculates were collected and analyzed weekly, and animals were sacrificed at various intervals for sex organ weights and histology. The first injection of D‐Nal(2)<jats:sup>6</jats:sup>‐LHRH caused an acute elevation in plasma levels of LH, FSH, and testosterone, measured at 2 and 4 hours after the injection. This acute response to injection was attenuated with each successive injection and by two weeks no elevation was seen, suggesting a down‐regulation of pituitary response. Basal levels of LH and testosterone were maximally depressed by four days of treatment. Testis volume, duration of erection, ejaculate volume, sperm count, sperm motility and testis volume all declined during treatment, with sperm count significantly lowered by two weeks and ejaculation volume becoming zero by five weeks of treatment. Spermatogenesis, assessed histologically, was partially suppressed at ten days and completely suppressed by 38 days of treatment. All parameters returned to normal following cessation of treatment. Recovery time was longer for the dogs treated for 42 days than for those treated for ten days. When testosterone was supplemented during 42 days of agonist treatment, basal plasma testosterone levels were maintained at the low end of the normal range. Testosterone supplementation did not prevent pituitary down‐regulation, suppression of spermatogenesis, or the decrease in testis and epididymis weights, but prevented the decline in duration of erection. Ejaculate volume and sperm count declined more slowly with combination treatment than with agonist alone. During the decline in sperm count sperm motility was maintained with combination treatment. Injection of hCG into control and agonist treated dogs resulted in similar percentage increases in plasma levels of testosterone, although peak levels were greater in control than in treated animals. The data suggest a pituitary desensitization with this LHRH agonist in the dog but only a minor role for testicular desensitization.</jats:p>",0

            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>We used a genome-wide microarray system containing 30,000 clones to evaluate total RNA that had been isolated from the brains of treated rats to identify the genes involved in the therapeutic mechanisms of various antidepressants, a tricyclic antidepressant (imipramine). a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (phenelzine) and psychoactive herbal extracts of <jats:italic>Nelumbinis Semen</jats:italic> (NS). To confirm the differential expression of the identified genes, we analyzed the amount of mRNA that was isolated from the hippocampus of rats that had been treated with antidepressants by real-time RT-PCR using primers specific for selected genes of interest. These data demonstrate that antidepressants interfere with the expression of a large array of genes involved in signaling, survival and protein metabolism, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of these antidepressants is very complex. Surprisingly, unlike other antidepressants, we found that the standardized herbal medicine, <jats:italic>Nelumbinis Semen</jats:italic>, is free of factors that can induce neurodegenerative diseases such as caspase 8, α-synuclein, and amyloid precursor protein. In addition, the production of the inflammatory cytokine, IFNγ, was significantly decreased in rat hippocampus in response to treatment with antidepressants, while the inhibitory cytokine, TGFβ, was significantly enhanced.</jats:p>

Prevention of Thromboplastin‐Induced Intravascular Coagulation in Rabbits by Warfarin as Monitored by Thrombotest,"<jats:p>During sustained DIC in rabbits, the protection by warfarin depended on the anticoagulant effect obtained, as reflected by Thrombotest (TT). Moderate treatment (‘IT below 18 %) was sufficient to prevent decrease in thrombocytes and plasma content of various clotting factors, whereas more intense treatment (TT below 9 %) was required to prevent the Occurrence of soluble fibrin in plasma, as indicated by a positive ethanol gelation test. The present observations suggest that, unless the ethanol test becomes negative, anticoagulant treatment must be considered as insufficient.</jats:p>",0
Long-term depression of naive synapses in adult hippocampus induced by asynchronous synaptic activity,"<jats:p> 1. Two independent Schaffer collateral pathways converging to the same pyramidal cell were alternately stimulated by 2-Hz trains (900 pulses) offset by a 150-ms interval in adult rat hippocampal slices. The second input underwent an immediate and persistent long-term depression (LTD). Depression in the first input was smaller than the second input. A narrower interpulse interval (20 ms) failed to induce LTD in either input. 2. Neither the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid nor the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (+)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxylphenyl-glycine blocked this associative LTD. However, coapplication of these two antagonists blocked LTD. 3. Associative LTD was blocked by prior injection of the Ca2+ chelator bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid into the postsynaptic cell and by bath-applied L-NG-nitroarginine, a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor. 4. We propose that temporally confined, asynchronous synaptic activity weakens the efficacy of naive synapses in slices from the adult hippocampus. </jats:p>",0

We investigated whether population characteristics (population size, sex ratio, immigration rate, variance in population size and population growth rate) explained variation within and among populations in the ratio of effective to census population size (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>e</jats:italic></jats:sub>/<jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>c</jats:italic></jats:sub>).

Genetic <jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>e</jats:italic></jats:sub> was much larger than demographic <jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>e</jats:italic></jats:sub>, probably due to a greater effect of immigration on genetic than demographic processes in local populations. Moreover, although estimates of genetic <jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>e</jats:italic></jats:sub> seemed to track <jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>c</jats:italic></jats:sub> quite well, the genetic <jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>e</jats:italic></jats:sub>‐estimates were often larger than <jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>c</jats:italic></jats:sub> within populations.

Analytical determination and pharmacokinetics of robenacoxib in the dog,"<jats:p>An analytical method was developed and validated for the measurement of the novel analgesic and anti‐inflammatory drug robenacoxib in blood and plasma of dogs and cats. To prevent nonreproducible carry‐over effects, an initial solid phase extraction procedure was followed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis for samples with concentrations in the range 500 to 20 000 ng/mL. To improve accuracy, samples of concentration 3 to 100 ng/mL were analyzed by liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry. Applying these methods, blood concentration‐time profiles and pharmacokinetic variables of robenacoxib in dogs were determined in a four‐phase cross‐over study, which compared different routes of administration of the drug, including intravenous (i.v.) injection, oral application with and without feed, and subcutaneous (s.c.) application. After i.v. administration the mean clearance from blood was 0.81 L/kg/h, the volume of distribution was 0.77 L/kg for the elimination phase and 0.24 L/kg for steady‐state, and the terminal half‐life in blood was 0.63 h. Maximum blood concentrations were obtained in less than 1 h following oral or s.c. application. Absolute bioavailability was 88% after s.c. injection, 84% after oral administration to fasted dogs, but was reduced to 62% when applied orally to fed dogs. In canine and feline plasma the degree of binding of robenacoxib to plasma protein <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> was greater than 98%. The blood:plasma concentration ratio was 0.44:1 in the dog and 0.65:1 in the cat. In conclusion analytical methods for the quantification of robenacoxib in blood and plasma in the dog and cat were developed and validated. In dogs, robenacoxib has good bioavailability after oral (84%) and subcutaneous (88%) administration.</jats:p>",0

</jats:list></jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The basal forebrain (BF) is an essential component of the ascending arousal systems and may be a key site through which the orexin (also known as hypocretin) neurons drive arousal and promote the maintenance of normal wakefulness. All orexin neurons also make dynorphin, and nearly all brain regions innervated by the orexin neurons express kappa opiate receptors, the main receptor for dynorphin. This is remarkable because orexin excites target neurons including BF neurons, but dynorphin has inhibitory effects. We identified the sources of dynorphin input to the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and substantia innominata (MCPO/SI) in mice and determined the effects of dynorphin‐A on MCPO/SI cholinergic neurons using patch‐clamp recordings in brain slices. We found that the orexin neurons are the main source of dynorphin input to the MCPO/SI region, and dynorphin‐A inhibits MCPO/SI cholinergic neurons through κ‐opioid receptors by (1) activation of a G protein‐coupled inwardly rectifying potassium current, (2) inhibition of a voltage‐gated Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> current and (3) presynaptic depression of the glutamatergic input to these neurons. The responses both to dynorphin‐A and to orexin‐A desensitize, but co‐application of dynorphin‐A and orexin‐A produces a sustained response. In addition, the polarity of the response to the co‐application depends on the membrane potential of BF neurons; at −40 mV the net effect of the co‐application is inhibition by dynorphin‐A, whereas at −70 mV the excitatory response to orexin‐A prevails. This suggests that depending on their state of activation, BF cholinergic neurons can be excited or inhibited by signals from the orexin neurons.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

"<i>Iso-S</i>-petasin, a hypotensive sesquiterpene from <i>Petasites formosanus</i>, depresses cardiac contraction and intracellular Ca2+ transients in adult rat ventricular myocytes","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Petasites formosanus is an indigenous species of the medicinal plant Petasites which has been used to treat hypertension. Both S-petasin and its isoform iso-S-petasin have been shown to be the effective ingredients in P. formosanus. However, their effect on heart function has not been revealed. This study was to examine the effect of iso-S-petasin on cardiac contractile function at the myocyte level. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from adult rat hearts and were stimulated to contract at 0.5 Hz under 1.0 mm extracellular Ca2+. Contractile properties were evaluated using an lonOptix MyoCam system including peak shortening (PS), time to PS (TPS), time to 90% re-lengthening (TR90) and maximal velocity of shortening/re-lengthening (±dL/dt). Intracellular Ca2+ properties were assessed by fura-2 and presented as Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) and intracellular Ca2+ decay. Acute application of iso-S-petasin (10−7 to 10−4 M) elicited a concentration-dependent inhibition in PS and CICR, with maximal inhibitions of 51.0% and 31.0%, respectively. iso-S-petasin also induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of ± dL/dt without affecting TPS, TR90, baseline intracellular Ca2+ level or intracellular Ca2+ decay. Elevation of extracellular Ca2+ from 1.0 mm to 2.7 mm significantly antagonized the iso-S-petasin-induced depression in PS and CICR. These results demonstrated a direct depressant action of iso-S-petasin on ventricular contraction, which may work in concert with its antihypertensive action to reduce the cardiac load. The iso-S-petasin-induced decrease in CICR may play a role in its cardiac depressant effect.</jats:p>",0

The pharmacokinetics of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine in dogs: parameter estimates following a single oral dose and 28 consecutive daily oral doses of clomipramine,"<jats:p>Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been recommended for the treatment of canine compulsive disorder. The pharmacokinetics of clomipramine in dogs have not been reported. This study describes the pharmacokinetics of clomipramine and its active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, in six male dogs. Serial blood samples were collected following both a single oral dose of clomipramine (3 mg/kg) and 28 consecutive daily oral doses (3 mg/kg q 24 h). In addition, ‘peak’ and ‘trough’ samples were taken throughout the 28‐day dosing period. Plasma was assayed for total (free and protein‐bound) clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine, using gas‐chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. Various pharmacokinetic parameters were then determined. Following a single dose of clomipramine, time of maximum plasma concentration (<jats:italic>t</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) of clomipramine was 0.75–3.1 h, maximum plasma concentration (<jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) was 16–310 ng/mL and elimination half‐life (<jats:italic>t</jats:italic><jats:sub>1/2el</jats:sub>) was 1.2–16 h;<jats:italic>t</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub>of desmethylclomipramine was 1.4–8.8 h,<jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub>was 21–134 ng/mL and<jats:italic>t</jats:italic><jats:sub>1/2el</jats:sub>was 1.2–2.3 h.

Spontaneous and Amphetamine‐Evoked Release of Cerebellar Noradrenaline After Sensorimotor Cortex Contusion: An In Vivo Microdialysis Study in the Awake Rat,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> Microdialysis sampling combined with HPLC was used to assess spontaneous and <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>‐amphetamine (AMPH)‐evoked release of noradrenaline (NA) in the cerebellum 1 day after probe implantation and 1 day after contusion of the right sensorimotor cortex (SMCX) in rats. In normal controls the mean β SEM basal NA release was 10.08 β 0.97 pg in the left cerebellar hemisphere and 8.21 β 1.17 pg in the right hemisphere 22–24 h after probe implantation. The average β SEM NA release in a 3‐h period after administration of AMPH (2 mg/kg, i.p.) increased to 453 β 47.35 pg in the left and to 402 β 49.95 pg in the right cerebellar hemisphere. NA release (range of 413–951% increase over baseline) was maximal 20–40 min postdrug, returned to basal levels within 5 h, and remained unchanged for the 22–24‐h postdrug measurement period. Animals with a focal SMCX contusion had a marked depression of both spontaneous and AMPH‐evoked NA release. Mean β SEM basal NA release was 4.84 β 1.09 pg in the left and 4.95 β 0.43 pg in the right cerebellar hemisphere from 22 to 24 h postinjury, with NA levels increasing to 259 β 75.44 and 219 β 23.45 pg in the respective hemispheres over a 3‐h period after AMPH. The maximal AMPH‐induced increase in NA release ranged from 522 to 1,088% of basal levels in contused rats, with NA release returning to predrug levels within 5 h and remaining depressed for at least 48 h postinjury. These data indicate that although neocortical injury results in a bilateral reduction of extracellular levels of NA in cerebellum, AMPH‐releasable NA stores are present in the cerebellum. These effects may be related to locomotor impairments and AMPH‐facilitated behavioral” recovery after cortical injury.</jats:p>",0
Too Much to Bear,"<jats:p>Abstract. Background: People who feel they have become a burden on others may become susceptible to suicidal ideation. When people no longer feel capable or productive, they may assume that friends and family members would be better off without them. Aim: The present study was designed to assess preliminary psychometric properties of a new measure, the Perceived Burdensomeness (PBS) Scale. Method: Depressed psychiatric patients (N = 173) were recruited from a veterans affairs medical center. Patients were assessed with a structured diagnostic interview and self-report measures assessing perceived burdensomeness, depression severity, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. Results: The present study supported preliminary evidence of reliability and concurrent validity of the PBS. Additionally, perceived burdensomeness was significantly associated with higher levels of hopelessness and suicidal ideation. Conclusion: It is hoped that with the aid of the PBS clinicians may be able to intervene more specifically in the treatment of suicidality.</jats:p>",0

Environmental Enrichment Increases Paired-Pulse Depression in Rat Auditory Cortex,"<jats:p> Temporal features are important for the identification of natural sounds. Earlier studies have shown that cortical processing of temporal information can be altered by long-term experience with modulated sounds. In a previous study, we observed that environmental enrichment dramatically increased the response of cortical neurons to single tone and noise burst stimuli in both awake and anesthetized rats. Here, we evaluate how enrichment influences temporal information processing in the auditory cortex. We recorded responses to repeated tones and noise bursts in awake rats using epidural evoked potentials and in anesthetized rats using microelectrodes. Enrichment increased the response of cortical neurons to stimuli presented at slow rates and decreased the response to stimuli presented at fast rates relative to controls. Our observation that enrichment substantially increased response strength and forward masking is consistent with earlier reports that long-term potentiation of cortical synapses is associated with increased paired-pulse depression. Enrichment also increased response synchronization at slow rates and decreased synchronization at fast rates. Paired-pulse depression increased within days of environmental enrichment and was restored to normal levels after return to standard housing conditions. These results are relevant to several clinical disorders characterized by abnormal gating of sensory information, including autism, schizophrenia, and dyslexia. </jats:p>",0

Dust from hog confinement facilities impairs Ca<sup>2+</sup>mobilization from sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum by inhibiting ryanodine receptors,"<jats:p>Individuals working in commercial hog confinement facilities have elevated incidences of headaches, depression, nausea, skeletal muscle weakness, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, and the molecular mechanisms for these nonrespiratory ailments remain incompletely undefined. A common element underlying these diverse pathophysiologies is perturbation of intracellular Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>homeostasis. This study assessed whether the dust generated inside hog confinement facilities contains compounds that alter Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>mobilization via ryanodine receptors (RyRs), key intracellular channels responsible for mobilizing Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>from internal stores to elicit an array of physiologic functions. Hog barn dust (HBD) was extracted with phosphate-buffered saline, sterile-filtered (0.22 μm), and size-separated using Sephadex G-100 resin. Fractions (F) 1 through 9 (M<jats:sub>w</jats:sub>&gt;10,000 Da) had no measurable effects on RyR isoforms. However, F10 through F17, which contained compounds of M<jats:sub>w</jats:sub>≤2,000 Da, modulated the [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]ryanodine binding to RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3 in a biphasic (Gaussian) manner. The K<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>values for F13, the most potent fraction, were 3.8 ± 0.2 μg/ml for RyR1, 0.2 ± 0.01 μg/ml and 19.1 ± 2.8 μg/ml for RyR2 (two binding sites), and 44.9 ± 2.8 μg/ml and 501.6 ± 9.2 μg/ml for RyR3 (two binding sites). In lipid bilayer assays, F13 dose-dependently decreased the open probabilities of RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3. Pretreating differentiated mouse skeletal myotubes (C2C12 cells) with F13 blunted the amplitudes of ryanodine- and K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-induced Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>transients. Because RyRs are present in many cell types, impairment in Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>mobilization from internal stores via these channels is a possible mechanism by which HBD may trigger these seemingly unrelated pathophysiologies.</jats:p>",0

Impaired Long-Term Potentiation in the Prefrontal Cortex of Huntington’s Disease Mouse Models: Rescue by D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; Dopamine Receptor Activation,"<jats:p>&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt; The introduction of gene testing for Huntington’s disease (HD) has enabled the neuropsychiatric and cognitive profiling of human gene carriers prior to the onset of overt motor and cognitive symptoms. Such studies reveal an early decline in working memory and executive function, altered EEG and a loss of striatal dopamine receptors. Working memory is processed in the prefrontal cortex and modulated by extrinsic dopaminergic inputs. &lt;i&gt;Objective:&lt;/i&gt; We sought to study excitatory synaptic function and plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex of mouse models of HD. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; We have used 2 mouse models of HD, carrying 89 and 116 CAG repeats (corresponding to a preclinical and symptomatic state, respectively) and performed electrophysiological field recording in coronal slices of the medial prefrontal cortex. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; We report that short-term synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP) are impaired and that the severity of impairment is correlated with the size of the CAG repeat. Remarkably, the deficits in LTP and short-term plasticity are reversed in the presence of a D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dopamine receptor agonist (SKF38393). &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; In a previous study, we demonstrated that a deficit in long-term depression (LTD) in the perirhinal cortex could also be reversed by a dopamine agonist. These and our current data indicate that inadequate dopaminergic modulation of cortical synaptic function is an early event in HD and may provide a route for the alleviation of cognitive dysfunction.</jats:p>",0

Afterimage-like effects in the motion-sensitive neuron H1,"<jats:p>
            A powerful effect resembling an afterimage is demonstrated on the pathway to the motion-sensitive neuron H1. This effect is independent of the locally generated gain control described in an earlier paper (Maddess &amp; Laughlin 1985,
            <jats:italic>Proc. R. Soc. Lond</jats:italic>
            . B 225, 251). The afterimage, produced across the eye by a stationary pattern, causes the sensitivity to movement to be different according to the local stimulus history, and the effects of low-contrast (0.1) patterns, presented for as little as a few hundred milliseconds, remain for up to 2 s. Moving patterns interact with the afterimage to modulate the spike rate of H1. The afterimage increases with contrast but saturates at contrasts above 0.5. Low spatial frequencies generate afterimages less effectively than moderate ones; this result indicates that the afterimage process could lie at, or after, lateral inhibition between tonic units. This is supported by the fact that the altered sensitivity profiles generated by single bright and dark vertical bars initially resemble Mach bands. However, this character alters as the afterimage decays, and the depression of H1’s response to moving bright stimuli, produced by the afterimage of a dark bar, continues to grow for up to 1 s after the adapting bar is removed. A short-lived (0.5 s) reduction of H1’s directional selectivity accompanies strong afterimage formation. All these factors, especially the saturation at low contrasts and the spatial frequency tuning, rule out light adaptation by photoreceptors as the afterimage source. Luminances used were also low enough to exclude influence by the pupil mechanism. Lastly, responses to patterns that are occasionally jumped by large or small distances are broadened by stimuli that produce an afterimage. Responses to small displacements have previously been described as ‘velocity impulse responses’ (Srinivasan 1983,
            <jats:italic>Vision Res</jats:italic>
            . 23, 659; Zaagman
            <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>
            . 1983,
            <jats:italic>IEEE Trans. SMC</jats:italic>
            13, 900) and so the response broadening (stimulus blurring) can be taken as a reduction of the fly’s temporal resolution of moving objects. Previously reported work shows that afterimages seen in humans and the effect reported here act over the same range of temporal frequencies rather than retinal drift speeds. This may suggest an important role for afterimage-like effects in the processing of the low temporal frequency components of moving images. Certainly, the fly’s afterimage system reduces the visibility of moving objects within patches of an image that, have on average, contained slowly varying motion signals. Given that H1 is a motion-sensitive neuron, detailed knowledge of this afterimage-like phenomenon appears to be essential for understanding the spatio-temporal function of H1, and perhaps of similar motion-sensitive neurons.

Females had higher levels of plasma cotinine and brain nicotine than males but had lower brain cotinine levels than males.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions: </jats:bold> Sensitivity to a specific action of nicotine cosegregates during selective breeding for differential sensitivity to a specific action of ethanol. The differential sensitivity of the HAS/LAS rats is due to differences in central nervous system sensitivity and not to pharmacokinetic differences. The differential central nervous system sensitivity cannot be explained by differences in the numbers of nicotinic receptors labeled in ligand‐binding experiments. The apparent genetic correlation between ethanol and nicotine sensitivities suggests that common genes modulate, in part, the actions of both ethanol and nicotine and may explain the frequent coabuse of these agents.</jats:p>",0

"Evaluation of standardized <i>Bacopa monniera</i> extract in sodium fluoride-induced behavioural, biochemical, and histopathological alterations in mice","<jats:p> Effect of standardized Bacopa monniera (BM; family: Scrophulariaceae) extract (100 and 300 mg/kg) against sodium fluoride (NaF; 100 and 200 ppm)-induced behavioural, biochemical, and neuropathological alterations in mice was evaluated. Akinesia, rotarod (motor coordination), forced swim test (depression), open field test (anxiety), transfer latency (memory), cholinesterase (ChE), and oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and lipid peroxidation) were determined in mice treated with NaF for 30 days alone and in combination with BM. NaF induced motor incoordination, depression, and memory impairment, and these were prevented by coadministration of BM in mice. However, NaF did not alter the weight gain, feed/water consumption, and anxiety profile. Suppression of ChE levels and increased oxidative stress were observed in mice treated with NaF. Coadministration of BM significantly improved the memory, ChE levels, and antioxidant enzymes but failed to alter the fluoride levels in NaF-treated mice. Histopathological studies revealed that BM protected the neuropathological alterations induced by NaF. </jats:p>",1

Sleep Disturbances among Persons who are Visually Impaired: Survey of Dog Guide Users,"<jats:p> It is claimed that blindness may predispose individuals to disturbed sleep because light is an important mechanism for entraining circadian rhythms. One in five respondents in a survey described the quality of their sleep as either poor or very poor. Exercise was associated with better sleep, and depression with poorer sleep. That visual acuity did not predict the quality of sleep casts doubt on the notion that restricted visual (photic) input is a widespread cause of sleep disturbance among persons who are visually impaired. As with sighted persons, depression appears to be a highly significant risk factor for disturbed sleep in persons who are visually impaired. </jats:p>",0

Mammalian neuromuscular development accelerated with early but slowed with late gestational administration of ACTH Peptide,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The neuropeptide ACTH 4–10, a nonsteroidogenic fragment of adrenocorticotropic hormone, has two distinct and opposite effects on developing nerve and muscle. Muscle is positively influenced by ACTH during the first part of gestation (G days 3–12) before innervation occurs. Subsequent effects on innervation are largely depressive and exerted only during G13–21. Treatment during G3–12 increases twitch amplitude, rise time and speed of contraction of directly and indirectly stimulated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of two wk old rats. Treatment during G13–21 slows contractions of indirectly stimulated EDL, whereas treatment throughout gestation (G3–G21) shows little effect. Thus, ACTH first accelerates muscle development then modulates this development through neuronal depression.</jats:p>",0

Fluctuation of Hepatic Enzymes Important in Glucose Metabolism in Relation to Thyroid Function,"<jats:p>Enzyme activities of pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase and of mitochondrial glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase were studied in the livers of rats under the following states of thyroid function: <jats:sup>131</jats:sup>I‐thyroidectomized rats, <jats:sup>131</jats:sup>I‐thyroidectomized rats treated with triiodothyronine, normal rats treated with excess of triiodothyronine, and normal untreated rats.

Role of prostaglandins in the reversal of one-kidney hypertension in the rabbit.,"<jats:p>Hypertensive rabbits with a clip on the renal artery of their solitary remaining kidney show an abrupt decrease in blood pressure after the arterial constriction is released. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains controversial, some experimental evidence suggests that it could be humorally mediated. The involvement of prostaglandins was investigated by examining the effect of the release of the arterial constriction on blood pressure, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary output in five conscious single-kidney hypertensive rabbits in which prostaglandin synthesis was blocked with indomethacin (priming intravenous injection of 9 mg/kg followed by a constant infusion of 1 mg/kg hour-1). The results were compared with those obtained in another group of five single-kidney hypertensive rabbits submitted to the same protocol but not treated with indomethacin. The blockade of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin prevented the increments in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate seen in the control rabbits after unclipping a significantly retarded the appearance of diuresis and the fall in blood pressure. Despite these observations, the results do not indicate a major participation of prostaglandins in the reversal of single-kidney hypertension, because the decrease in blood pressure 9 hours after the removal of the arterial constriction was similar in both groups.</jats:p>",0

Influence of Mirtazapine on the Hypotensive Activity of Enalapril and Propranolol in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> Mirtazapine is a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant. The influence of the drug on the cardiovascular system has not been definitely determined. Therefore, we made an attempt to evaluate the influence of chronic administration of mirtazapine on the hypotensive action of a single administered dose of propranolol and enalapril in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The animals were divided into eight experimental groups. Mirtazapine (5 and 10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally for 14 days. Twenty‐four hours after the last administration of the drug, the rats received a single intraperitoneal dose of hypotensive drugs (propranolol 5 mg/kg or enalapril 10 mg/kg) or 1% solution of methylcellulose. Mirtazapine administered chronically did not affect the hypotensive effect of a single dose of propranolol or enalapril in spontaneously hypertensive rats. It seems that mirtazapine could be a useful drug in patients with depression accompanied by hypertension.</jats:p>",0

NMDA Receptor and Nitric Oxide Synthase Activation Regulate Polysialylated Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule Expression in Adult Brainstem Synapses,"<jats:p>Here we report that synapses in the adult dorsal vagal complex, a gateway for many primary afferent fibers, express a high level of the polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM). We show that electrical stimulation of the vagal afferents causes a rapid decrease of PSA-NCAM expression both<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>and in acute slices. Inhibition of NMDA receptor activity completely prevented the decrease. Blockade of calmodulin activation, neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase, or soluble guanylyl cyclase and chelation of extracellular NO mimicked this inhibition. Our data provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how activity-linked stimulation of the NMDA–NO–cGMP pathway induces rapid changes in PSA-NCAM expression, which may be associated with long-term depression.</jats:p>",0

The synthesis of ribonucleic acid in immature rat uterus responding to oestradiol-17β,"<jats:p>Stimulation of incorporation of labelled precursors into the RNA of immature rat uterus is an early result of oestradiol-17β action. However, the extent of the increased incorporation varies with the mode of administration of the labelled precursors and with the weight of the rat. At the age and weight range normally used response is maximal at ten times control incorporation, 4h after the administration of 0.3μg or more of oestradiol-17β. Under these conditions the stimulation of incorporation into the acid-soluble fraction is only 2–2.5-fold. When the purified RNA is separated on polyacrylamide gels the major increase in incorporation of radioactive precursor is found in rRNA and 4S RNA; the formation of the former has been followed from the 45S precursor. Preceding these events by at least 30min, however, is an increase in the incorporation of precursor into RNA species of very high molecular weight, which remained in the first few slices of the gel. The possible significance of these findings is discussed. The increased synthesis of rRNA in response to oestradiol-17β is more strongly inhibited by actinomycin D than the synthesis of other RNA species. Cycloheximide, depending on time of administration and dosage, inhibits either RNA synthesis or the maturation of rRNA.</jats:p>",0

Transient Neutralization of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Can Produce a Chronic Fungal Infection in an Immunocompetent Host: Potential Role of Immature Dendritic Cells,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The mechanisms underlying induction of immune dysregulation and chronic fungal infection by a transient tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) deficiency remain to be defined. The objective of our studies was to determine the potential contribution of neutropenia and immature dendritic cells to the immune deviation. Administration of an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody at day 0 neutralized TNF-α only during the first week of a pulmonary<jats:italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</jats:italic>infection. Transient neutralization of TNF-α resulted in transient depression of interleukin-12 (IL-12), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production but permanently impaired long-term clearance of the infection from the lungs even after the levels of these cytokines increased and a vigorous inflammatory response developed. Early neutrophil recruitment was defective in the absence of TNF-α. However, as demonstrated by neutrophil depletion studies, this did not account for the decrease in IL-12 and IFN-γ levels and did not play a role in establishing chronic pulmonary cryptococcal infection. Transient TNF-α neutralization also produced a deficiency in CD11c<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>MHC II<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>cells and IL-12 in the lymph nodes, potentially implicating a defect in mature dendritic cell trafficking. Transfer of cryptococcal antigen-pulsed immature dendritic cells into naïve mice prior to intratracheal challenge resulted in the development of a nonprotective immune response to<jats:italic>C. neoformans</jats:italic>that was similar to that observed in anti-TNF-α-treated mice (increased IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 levels, pulmonary eosinophilia, and decreased clearance). Thus, stimulation of an antifungal response by immature dendritic cells can result in an immune deviation similar to that produced by transient TNF-α deficiency, identifying a new mechanism by which a chronic fungal infection can occur in an immunocompetent host.</jats:p>",0

Effect of Neuraminidase on Lymphoid Cells,"<jats:p>After neuraminidase treatment the electrophoretic mobility of mouse lymphocytes (B and T cells) and thymocytes was reduced to a similar value, .a diminution of about 40%, 60%, and 40%, respectively. Thus B and T cells and thymocytes may have a common surface charge after removal of sialic acid. The percentage of cells binding anti‐thymocyte serum was not changed; thus sialic acid does not seem to be an important part of the specific antigen of lymphoid cells. Similar amounts of sialic acid were released from B and T Ceils, whereas less than half of this was released from the thymocytes. Thus, whereas thymocytes are characterized by their low electrophoretic mobility and low sialic acid release and T cells by high electrophoretic mobility and high sialic acid release, B‐cells in contrast show a low electrophoretic mobility and high sialic acid release.</jats:p>",0

Inbreeding Depression and Male Survivorship in Drosophila: Implications for Senescence Theory,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>The extent to which inbreeding depression affects longevity and patterns of survivorship is an important issue from several research perspectives, including evolutionary biology, conservation biology, and the genetic analysis of quantitative traits. However, few previous inbreeding depression studies have considered longevity as a focal life-history trait. We maintained laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster at census population sizes of 2 and 10 male-female pairs for up to 66 generations and performed repeated assays of male survivorship throughout this time period. On average, significant levels of inbreeding depression were observed for median life span and age-specific mortality. For age-specific mortality, the severity of inbreeding depression increased over the life span. We found that a baseline inbreeding load of 0.307 lethal equivalents per gamete affected age-specific mortality, and that this value increased at a rate of 0.046 per day of the life span. With respect to some survivorship parameters, the differentiation of lineages was nonlinear with respect to the inbreeding coefficient, which suggested that nonadditive genetic variation contributed to variation among lineages. These findings provide insights into the genetic basis of longevity as a quantitative trait and have implications regarding the mutation-accumulation evolutionary explanation of senescence.</jats:p>",0

Can molecular imprinting explain heterozygote deficiency and hybrid vigor?,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Molecular imprinting, the phenomenon of differential expressions of a gene based on whether it is paternally or maternally derived, has been noted in mice, humans, and other nonmammalian organisms. Effects of differential imprinting are important not only in the study of the manifestation of deleterious genes; they have important evolutionary implications as well. It is shown here that molecular imprinting may mimic observations that are often construed to be due to hybrid vigor and/or inbreeding depression. Furthermore, if a locus undergoes differential imprinting, it also yields observed genotypic proportions which mimic heterozygote deficiency in the population without the aid of natural selection.</jats:p>",0

Role of the renin-angiotensin system in drinking of seawater-adapted eels<i>Anguilla japonica</i>: a reevaluation,"<jats:p>The role of ANG II, a potent dipsogenic hormone, in copious drinking of seawater eels was examined. SQ-14225 (SQ), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, infused intra-arterially at 0.01–1 μg · kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>· min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, depressed drinking and arterial blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition was accompanied by a small decrease in plasma ANG II concentration, which became significant at 1 μg · kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>· min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. After the infusate was changed back to the vehicle, the depression of drinking and arterial pressure continued for &gt;2 h, although plasma ANG II concentration rebounded above the level before SQ infusion. By contrast, infusion of anti-ANG II serum (0.01–1 μg · kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>· min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) did not suppress drinking and arterial pressure, although plasma ANG II concentration decreased to undetectable levels. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and plasma osmolality, which influence drinking rate in eels, did not change during SQ or antiserum infusions. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays only a minor role in the vigorous drinking observed in seawater eels. The results also suggest that the antidipsogenic and vasodepressor effects of SQ in seawater eels are not due solely to the inhibition of ANG II formation in plasma.</jats:p>",0

Adaptive changes in serotonin neurons of the raphe nuclei in 5‐HT<sub>4</sub> receptor knock‐out mouse,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Decreased serotonin (5‐HT) transmission is thought to underlie several mental diseases, including depression and feeding disorders. However, whether deficits in genes encoding G protein‐coupled receptors may down‐regulate the activity of 5‐HT neurons is unknown currently. Based on recent evidence that stress‐induced anorexia may involve 5‐HT<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>receptors (5‐HT<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>R), we measured various aspects of 5‐HT function in 5‐HT<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>R knock‐out (KO) mice. When compared to dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5‐HT neurons from wild‐type mice, those from 5‐HT<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>R KO mice exhibited reduced spontaneous electrical activity. This reduced activity was associated with diminished tissue levels of 5‐HT and its main metabolite, 5‐hydroxyindole acetic acid (5‐HIAA). Cumulative, systemic doses of the 5‐HT uptake blocker citalopram, that reduced 5‐HT cell firing by 30% in wild‐type animals, completely inhibited 5‐HT neuron firing in the KO mice. This effect was reversed by administration of the 5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub> receptor (5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>R) antagonist, WAY100635, in mice of both genotypes. Other changes in DRN of the KO mice included increases in the levels of 5‐HT plasma membrane transporter sites and mRNA, as well as a decrease in the density of 5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>R sites without any change in 5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub> mRNA content. With the exception of increased 5‐HT turnover index in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens and a decreased density of 5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>R sites in the dorsal hippocampus (CA1) and septum, no major changes were detected in 5‐HT territories of projection, suggesting region‐specific adaptive changes. The mechanisms whereby 5‐HT<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>R mediate a tonic positive influence on the firing activity of DRN 5‐HT neurons and 5‐HT content remain to be determined.</jats:p>",1
Repeated Cocaine Administration Impairs Group II Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Mediated Long-Term Depression in Rat Medial Prefrontal Cortex,"<jats:p>Drug-induced neuroadaptations within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are thought to underlie the development of cocaine sensitization. Here, we report that repeated cocaine administration<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>impaired the long-term depression (LTD) induced by bath application of group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonists DCG-IV [2<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>, 2′<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>, 3′<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>)-2-(2′, 3′-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine] or LY379268 [(1<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>,4<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>,5<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>,6<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>)-4-amino-2-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-4,6-dicarboxylic acid] at excitatory synapses onto layer V pyramidal neurons of rat mPFC. In contrast, this impairment was not found in slices from rats treated with saline or a single dose of cocaine. Such effect of cocaine was selectively prevented when cocaine was coadministered with the selective D<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>-like receptor antagonist SCH23390 [(<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>)-(+)-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1<jats:italic>H</jats:italic>-3-benzazepine]. In slices from control rats, a brief application of either protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol-12,13-dibutyrute or adenosine A<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>receptor agonist 2-chloro-<jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sup>6</jats:sup>-(3-iodobenzyl)-adenosine-5-<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-methyluronamide mimicked the effect of repeated cocaine treatment to impair the induction of LTD. Bilateral intra-mPFC infusion of PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I or adenosine A<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>receptor antagonist MRS1220 (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-[9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)[1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-benzeneacetamide) before cocaine injection prevented cocaine-induced impairment of LTD induction. Furthermore, endogenous adenosine tone is greater in slices from cocaine-treated rats than from the saline-treated controls. When the metabolism of cAMP to adenosine was blocked, the extent of LTD in slices from saline and cocaine-treated rats was similar. These results suggest that cocaine-induced impairment of group II mGluR-mediated LTD is caused, at least in part, by an increase in adenosine subsequent to the rise in cAMP after D<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>-like receptor activation, which leads to an adenosine A<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>receptor-mediated upregulation of PKC activity and thereby triggers an inhibition of group II metabotropic glutamate receptor function.</jats:p>",0

Chronic psychosocial stress regulates the expression of both GR and MR mRNA in the hippocampal formation of tree shrews,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A persistent hyperactivity of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis and thus elevated glucocorticoid levels are main neuroendocrine features of depressive symptomatology in humans. The broad range of effects that are set off by glucocorticoids is mediated by glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), which themselves are subject to autoregulation. In order to investigate the impact of long‐lasting psychological stress on corticosteroid receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampal formation, we employed the psychosocial stress paradigm in male tree shrews (<jats:italic>Tupaia belangeri</jats:italic>). By in situ hybridization studies and semiquantitative evaluation of stress‐induced changes of GR and MR mRNA expression at the single‐cell level, brain tissue from subordinate animals which were exposed to 27 days (1 h/day) of social confrontation was compared to that of nonstressed animals. Four weeks of stress exposure resulted in a downregulation of GR mRNA in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3 of subordinate male tree shrews compared to controls. The MR mRNA content in these subfields of the anterior hippocampus was also clearly reduced. On the contrary, in a more posterior location on the longitudinal axis of the tree shrew hippocampus, the MR message was increased in subfields CA1 and CA3 and in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest a relevance of the stress‐induced regulation of both corticosteroid receptor subtype mRNAs in a naturalistic challenging situation. Moreover, the differential regulation of MR mRNA along the rostrocaudal axis of the hippocampus adds another feature to the heterogenous composition of this structure.

The role of 5-HT1A receptors in mediating acute negative effects of antidepressants: implications in pediatric depression,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Acute antidepressant exposure elevates the frequency of impulsive behavior and suicidal thoughts in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). Long-term antidepressant treatment, however, is beneficial for pediatric MDD, so it is necessary to explore novel treatments that prevent the potentially dangerous consequences of acute antidepressant initiation. In the present study, a treatment strategy designed to reverse the acute negative behavioral effects of antidepressants was tested in rodents. Co-administration of the 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) antagonist WAY-100635 reversed the negative effects of acute fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but not reboxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, supporting the involvement of 5-HT1AR in mediating the negative consequences of acute selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment. No 5-HT1AR antagonists are currently approved for use in pediatric populations, so alternative strategies should be explored. One such strategy was suggested based on the hypothesis that the rate of 5-HT1AR activation and the subsequent inhibition of serotonergic neuron activity caused by acute SSRI administration is proportional to the loading rate of an antidepressant. Existing pharmacological data were examined, and significant correlations were observed between the half-life of antidepressants and the rate of suicide-related events (SREs). Specifically, antidepressants with longer half-lives have lower rates of SREs. On the basis of these data, novel dosing strategies were developed for five antidepressants to mimic the pharmacological profile of the antidepressant with the longest half-life, fluoxetine. These dosing strategies could be used to decrease the rate of SREs associated with acute antidepressant treatment in pediatric MDD until an improved pharmacological treatment is developed.</jats:p>",0

Postembryonic growth of the optic tectum in goldfish. II. Modulation of cell proliferation by retinal fiber input,"<jats:p>The proliferation of cells in the germinal zone of the optic tectum of adult goldfish was studied following unilateral optic nerve crush or removal of one eye. Dividing germinal cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine, which was injected at various times (0 to 30 days) following surgery; fish were sacrificed after short (48 hr) survival times. The numbers of labeled nuclei in the tectal germinal zones were compared on the two sides (intact and denervated). We show that permanent removal of optic input (by enucleation) resulted in a sustained depression of [3H]thymidine incorporation in the tectal germinal zone on the denervated compared to the intact side. Temporary denervation (by optic nerve crush) initially had a similar effect; however, upon reinnervation of the tectum by regenerating optic fibers, proliferation was enhanced on the experimental side compared to the intact side. Because cells in the germinal zone are known to produce new tectal cells, neurons as well as glia, in the normal growing adult brain (Raymond, P. A. and S. S. Easter, Jr. (1983) J. Neurosci. 3: 1077–1091), some of the proliferating cells may have been generating neurons. This inference is supported by the observation that in two fish whose right eye had been removed more than 2 years earlier, there were fewer neurons in the denervated tectum than in the intact tectum. Thus, it is likely that the observed decrease in incorporation of [3H]thymidine by cells in the germinal zone of the denervated optic tectum resulted in a slower rate of addition of new tectal cells on the affected side. We conclude that cytogenesis in the germinal zone of the growing optic tectum of adult goldfish is regulated by optic fiber input. This mechanism may be important in matching the rates of growth of retina and tectum in the normal brain of the growing adult fish.</jats:p>",0

Differential Modulation of Nociceptive versus Non-Nociceptive Synapses by Endocannabinoids,"<jats:sec><jats:title>Background</jats:title><jats:p> Although a number of clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated analgesic effects of cannabinoid treatments, there are also instances when cannabinoids have had no effect or even exacerbated pain. The observed pro-nociceptive effects appear to be due to cannabinoid-induced disinhibition of afferent synaptic input to nociceptive circuits. To better understand how cannabinoid-mediated plasticity can have both pro- and anti-nociceptive effects, we examined the possibility that cannabinoids differentially modulate nociceptive vs. non-nociceptive synapses onto a shared postsynaptic target. These experiments were carried out in the central nervous system (CNS) of the medicinal leech, in which it is possible to intracellularly record from presynaptic nociceptive (N-cell) or pressure-sensitive (P-cell) neurons and their shared postsynaptic targets. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p> The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2AG) elicited significant long-lasting depression in nociceptive (N-cell) synapses. However, non-nociceptive (P-cell) synapses were potentiated following 2AG treatment. 2AG-induced potentiation of non-nociceptive synapses was blocked by the TRPV antagonist SB366791, suggesting involvement of the same TRPV-like receptor that has already been shown to mediate endocannabinoid-dependent depression in nociceptive inputs. Treatment with the GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline also blocked 2AG-induced potentiation, consistent with the idea that increased synaptic signaling was the result of endocannabinoid-mediated disinhibition. Interestingly, while bicuculline by itself increased non-nociceptive synaptic transmission, nociceptive synapses were depressed by this GABA receptor antagonist indicating that nociceptive synapses were actually excited by GABAergic input. Consistent with these observations, GABA application depolarized the nociceptive afferent and hyperpolarized the non-nociceptive afferent. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p> These findings show that endocannabinoids can differentially modulate nociceptive vs. non-nociceptive synapses and that GABAergic regulation of these synapses plays an important role in determining whether endocannabinoids have a potentiating or depressing effect. </jats:p></jats:sec>",0

            channel blocker. KO ventricular cells exhibited no response to KCOs, but gene transfer of Kir6.2 into neonatal ventricular cells rescued the electrophysiological response to P-1075. In terms of contractile function, pinacidil decreased force generation in WT but not KO hearts. Pinacidil and diazoxide produced concentration-dependent relaxation in both WT and KO aortas precontracted with norepinephrine. In addition, pinacidil induced a glibenclamide-sensitive current of similar magnitude in WT and KO aortic smooth muscle cells and comparable levels of hypotension in anesthetized WT and KO mice. In both WT and KO aortas, only Kir6.1 mRNA was expressed. These findings indicate that the Kir6.2 subunit mediates the depression of cardiac excitability and contractility induced by KCOs; in contrast, Kir6.2 plays no discernible role in the arterial tree.

Preservation of diastolic function in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in rats,"<jats:p>During ischemic heart diseases and when heart failure progresses depletion of myocardial energy stores occurs. d-Ribose (R) has been shown to improve cardiac function and energy status after ischemia. Folic acid (FA) is an essential cofactor in the formation of adenine nucleotides. Therefore, we assessed whether chronic R-FA administration during the development of hypertrophy resulted in an improved cardiac function and energy status. In Wistar rats ( n = 40) compensatory right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy was induced by monocrotaline (30 mg/kg; MCT), whereas saline served as control. Both groups received a daily oral dose of either 150 mg·kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>·day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>dextrose (placebo) or R-FA (150 and 40 mg·kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>·day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively). In Langendorff-perfused hearts, RV and left ventricular (LV) pressure development and collagen content as well as total RV adenine nucleotides (TAN), creatine content, and RV and LV collagen content were determined. In the control group R-FA had no effect. In the MCT-placebo group, TAN and creatine content were reduced, RV and LV diastolic pressure-volume relations were steeper, RV systolic pressures were elevated, RV and LV collagen content was increased, and RV-LV diastolic interaction was altered compared with controls. In the MCT-R-FA group, TAN, RV and LV diastolic stiffness, RV and LV collagen content, and RV-LV diastolic interaction were normalized to the values in the control group while creatine content remained depressed and RV systolic function remained elevated. In conclusion, the depression of energy status in compensated hypertrophic myocardium observed was partly prevented by chronic R-FA administration and accompanied by a preservation of diastolic function and collagen deposition.</jats:p>",0

Time-dependent hypoxic ventilatory responses in rats: effects of ketanserin and 5-carboxamidotryptamine,"<jats:p>We hypothesized that the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) active drugs ketanserin and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) would modulate time-dependent hypoxic phrenic and hypoglossal responses, including 1) short-term hypoxic response, 2) posthypoxia frequency decline (PHFD), and 3) long-term facilitation (LTF) of respiratory motor output. Phrenic and hypoglossal nerve activities were recorded in urethan-anesthetized, paralyzed, vagotomized, and artificially ventilated rats pretreated either with ketanserin (5-HT<jats:sub>2A/C</jats:sub>antagonist; 2 mg/kg iv), 5-CT (5-HT<jats:sub>1A/B</jats:sub>agonist; 10 μg/kg iv), or saline (sham). Rats were exposed to three 5-min episodes of hypoxia [fractional inspired O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>([Formula: see text]) = 0.11], separated by 5 min of hyperoxia ([Formula: see text] = 0.5). During hypoxia, ketanserin augmented phrenic but not hypoglossal burst amplitude; 5-CT had no effect. Both drugs accentuated PHFD. Ketanserin blocked phrenic LTF; hypoglossal LTF was not apparent, even in sham-treated rats. 5-CT reversed LTF, resulting in a long-lasting depression of phrenic burst frequency and amplitude without effect on hypoglossal burst amplitude. The data suggest that 1) 5-HT<jats:sub>2A/C</jats:sub>receptor activation modulates the short-term hypoxic phrenic response and PHFD and is necessary for LTF; and 2) 5-CT may affect time-dependent hypoxic ventilatory responses by reducing serotonin release via 5-HT<jats:sub>1A/B</jats:sub>autoreceptor activation.</jats:p>",0
Role of RNA Synthesis in the Estrogen Induction of a Specific Uterine Protein,"<jats:p>The rate of amino acid incorporation into a specific uterine protein (induced protein band) isolated by gel electrophoresis has been shown to be markedly stimulated within an hour after estrogen administration. Injection of actinomycin D (8 mg/kg) prior to estrogen blocks the synthesis of induced protein. The accumulation of the product of the actinomycin D-sensitive step (induced protein band RNA) is significant 15 minutes after estrogen, and its synthesis would appear to be initiated as soon as the estrogen-receptor complex reaches the nucleus. Blocking protein synthesis with puromycin or cycloheximide did not affect the accumulation of induced protein band RNA, indicating that this is one of the earliest macromolecular synthetic events to occur after estrogen administration.</jats:p>",0
Impact of Persistent Cortical Activity (Up States) on Intracortical and Thalamocortical Synaptic Inputs,"<jats:p> The neocortex generates short epochs of persistent activity called up states, which are associated with changes in cellular and network excitability. Using somatosensory thalamocortical slices, we studied the impact of persistent cortical activity during spontaneous up states on intrinsic cellular excitability (input resistance) and on excitatory synaptic inputs of cortical cells. At the intrinsic excitability level, we found that the expected decrease in input resistance (high conductance) resulting from synaptic barrages during up states is counteracted by an increase in input resistance due to depolarization per se. The result is a variable but on average relatively small reduction in input resistance during up states. At the synaptic level, up states enhanced a late synaptic component of short-latency thalamocortical field potential responses but suppressed intracortical field potential responses. The thalamocortical enhancement did not reflect an increase in synaptic strength, as determined by measuring the evoked postsynaptic current, but instead an increase in evoked action potential (spike) probability due to depolarization during up states. In contrast, the intracortical suppression was associated with a reduction in synaptic strength, apparently driven by increased presynaptic intracortical activity during up states. In addition, intracortical suppression also reflected a reduction in evoked spike latency caused by depolarization and the abolishment of longer-latency spikes caused by stronger inhibitory drive during up states. In conclusion, depolarization during up states increases the success of excitatory synaptic inputs to reach firing. However, activity-dependent synaptic depression caused by increased presynaptic firing during up states and the enhancement of evoked inhibitory drive caused by depolarization suppress excitatory intracortical synaptic inputs. </jats:p>",0

Cardiovascular Studies during Controlled Baroreflex Activation in the Dog: I. Effects of Enflurane,"<jats:p>In chloralose‐anaesthetized dogs the carotid sinuses were bilaterally perfused with blood from a femoral artery, either at systemic arterial pressure through a direct by‐pass or with a pump in order to control the sinus pressure. Influences from cardiac receptors and aortic baroreceptors were eliminated by denervation. Administration of enflurane (1.6% end‐tidal concentration) with the presence of barostatic modulation, i. e. the carotid sinuses were perfused at prevailing systemic arterial pressure, reduced cardiac performance (cardiac output, cardiac contractility, heart rate and left ventricular stroke work) and mean arterial pressure. When barostatic compensation of enflurane‐induced circulatory changes was prevented by maintaining sinus perfusion pressure constant at the pre‐enflurane level, these haemodynamic alterations, with the exception of cardiac output, were significantly more pronounced. Furthermore, systemic vascular resistance decreased. We conclude that barostatic reflexes significantly modify cardiovascular depressive effects of enflurane.</jats:p>",0

Chronic Glucocorticoids Increase Hippocampal Vulnerability to Neurotoxicity under Conditions That Produce CA3 Dendritic Retraction But Fail to Impair Spatial Recognition Memory,"<jats:p>We previously found that chronic stress conditions producing CA3 dendritic retraction and spatial memory deficits make the hippocampus vulnerable to the neurotoxin ibotenic acid (IBO). The purpose of this study was to determine whether exposure to chronic corticosterone (CORT) under conditions that produce CA3 dendritic retraction would enhance CA3 susceptibility to IBO. Male Sprague Dawley rats were chronically treated for 21 d with CORT in drinking water (400 μg/ml), and half were given daily injections of phenytoin (40 mg/kg), an antiepileptic drug that prevents CA3 dendritic retraction. Three days after treatments stopped, IBO was infused into the CA3 region. Conditions producing CA3 dendritic retraction (CORT and vehicle) exacerbated IBO-induced CA3 damage compared with conditions in which CA3 dendritic retraction was not observed (vehicle and vehicle, vehicle and phenytoin, CORT and phenytoin). Additionally, spatial recognition memory was assessed using the Y-maze, revealing that conditions producing CA3 dendritic retraction failed to impair spatial recognition memory. Furthermore, CORT levels in response to a potentially mild stressor (injection and Y-maze exposure) stayed at basal levels and failed to differ among key groups (vehicle and vehicle, CORT and vehicle, CORT and phenytoin), supporting the interpretations that CORT levels were unlikely to have been elevated during IBO infusion and that the neuroprotective actions of phenytoin were not through CORT alterations. These data are the first to show that conditions with prolonged glucocorticoid elevations leading to structural changes in hippocampal dendritic arbors can make the hippocampus vulnerable to neurotoxic challenges. These findings have significance for many disorders with elevated glucocorticoids that include depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Cushing's disease.</jats:p>",0

Chelidonic acid evokes antidepressant-like effect through the up-regulation of BDNF in forced swimming test,"<jats:p> Depression is usually accompanied by neuro-inflammatory reactions. Chelidonic acid, in particular, has shown anti-inflammatory effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-depressant effects of chelidonic acid and to discuss the potential mechanisms of a forced swimming test. Chelidonic acid was administered orally once a day for 14 days. On the 14th day, chelidonic acid resulted in a significant decrease in immobility time during the forced swimming test without alteration of locomotor activity, in an open field test. Chelidonic acid also increased the number of nissl bodies in the hippocampus. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation in the hippocampus were up-regulated by the administration of chelidonic acid. Chelidonic acid administration significantly increased the mRNA expression of hippocampal estrogen receptor-β. The levels of hippocampal interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were effectively attenuated by the administration of chelidonic acid. In addition, chelidonic acid significantly increased the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), dopamine, and norepinephrine compared with those levels for the mice that were administered distilled water in the hippocampus. These results suggest that chelidonic acid might serve as a new therapeutic strategy for the regulation of depression associated with inflammation. </jats:p>",1

EFFECTS OF STEROID SUPPRESSION AND GONADECTOMY ON ADRENAL 5α-REDUCTASE ACTIVITY AND CORTICOSTERONE PRODUCTION IN RATS,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
        <jats:p>Studies were conducted to further examine the interaction between gonadal hormones and ACTH in the regulation of adrenocortical function. Gonadectomy for a period of two weeks in pre-puberal rats of either sex or in adults for one week, was without effect on adrenal 5α-reductase activity and corticosterone production <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. Cortisone administration to intact rats, both before and after puberty, suppressed corticosterone and total steroid production and increased adrenal reductase activity. Ovariectomy in immature or adult females did not modify the effects of cortisone on adrenal function. Orchiectomy, both before and after puberty, synergistically enhanced the actions of cortisone to increase 5α-reductase activity and lower corticosterone production without affecting total steroid output. These observations lend support to the hypothesis that gonadal hormones interact with ACTH in the control of adrenocortical function. Adrenal 5α-reductase seems to be a common site of action for the effects.</jats:p>",0
Synaptic Adaptation to Repeated Hypoglycemia Depends on the Utilization of Monocarboxylates in Guinea Pig Hippocampal Slices,"<jats:p>This report provides in vitro evidence that synaptic activity becomes resistant to repeated hypoglycemia, i.e., hypoglycemic synaptic adaptation occurs. Synaptic function was estimated by the amplitude of the postsynaptic population spike (PS) recorded in the granule cell layer of guinea pig hippocampal slices. ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr), glycogen, and glucose concentrations were measured to investigate energy metabolism homeostasis. Glucose deprivation produced a complete elimination of the PS amplitude, with a 50% inhibition by 10.6 min, and a ∼15% reduction in ATP and PCr concentrations. Low-glucose (0.5–1 mmol/l) medium gradually depressed the PS. After recovery from glucose depletion, repeated glucose deprivation produced a slowly developing depression of PS, with a 50% inhibition by 36.5 min. However, ATP and PCr concentrations were maintained. Incubation in secondary low-glucose medium maintained PS amplitude. Hippocampal glycogen and glucose concentrations promptly decreased during repeated glucose deprivation, indicating that glycogenolysis does not fuel synaptic adaptation to repeated hypoglycemia. Synaptic function during repeated glucose depletion was reversibly depressed by addition of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, inhibitors of the monocarboxylate transporter. Replacement of extracellular glucose with Na-lactate or Na-pyruvate sustained synaptic transmission after transient glucose depletion. These results indicate that synaptic utilization of monocarboxylates sustains hypoglycemic synaptic adaptation.</jats:p>",0
Anatomical observation of six calves affected with segmental aplasia of the spinal cord,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Four male and two female Holstein‐Friesian calves with segmental aplasia of the spinal cord were examined macroscopically and radiographically, and in some cases also histologically. External symptoms included inability to stand, deep depression of the body near the middle of the back but without any blemish in the skin, and slight reduction of the body length. Both hind limbs were almost normal. In every case segmental aplasia of the spinal cord was observed between the caudal thoracic and the cranial lumbar region. Owing to this defect, the vertebrae of that limited area consisted only of the body and the ribs fused on both sides. The sternum showed abnormal ossification at its caudal part. Other defects were observed such as kyphoscoliosis (six cases), polycystic kidney (one case), cryptorchidism (one case), and XX/XY chimerism (one case). From these findings it was apparent that this anomaly was uniquely different from the other two main spinal cord anomalies, spina bifida and perosomus elumbis. One conceivable pathogenesis of this rare anomaly, it was conjectured, is as follows: This anomaly results primarily from a segmental disorder of the neural tube, probably due to vascular problems, whereby a part of the spinal cord fails to develop properly from its normal genesis. Anomalous shapes of the vertebral column and ribs are perhaps secondary defects caused by aplasia of the spinal cord.</jats:p>",0
"Tetrandrine and Isotetrandrine, Two Bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinoline Alkaloids from <i>Menispermaceae</i>, with Rat Uterine Smooth Muscle Relaxant Activity","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>The effects of two bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids, 1S, 1′S tetrandrine and its isomer 1R, 1′S isotetrandrine, were investigated in rat isolated uterus in order to identify the mechanism of relaxant action and to study the influence of the absolute configuration on the activity of these alkaloids. Both inhibited the uterine contraction induced by high K+, acetylcholine and oxytocin. In Ca2+-free medium, isotetrandrine relaxed the sustained contraction induced by oxytocin but tetrandrine did not. The relaxant effects of the alkaloids may be due to blockade of calcium influx through specific channels. Tetrandrine and isotetrandrine modify the calcium channel in a nonreversible manner whilst only isotetrandrine acts intracellularly. Tetrandrine shows a more specific relaxant activity as a calcium entry blocker.</jats:p>",0

Excitatory stimulation during postsynaptic inhibition induces long-term depression in hippocampus in vivo,"<jats:p> 1. As part of an effort to evaluate the biological plausibility of theoretically derived principles of synaptic modification, we studied activity-dependent long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus of anesthetized adult rats. Field potentials of CA1 pyramidal cells evoked by single-pulse stimulation (0.1 Hz) of the commissural afferents were recorded before and after paired-pulse stimulation (0.5 Hz) of the same pathway. A train of 150 or 200 paired pulses produced robust LTD of the commissural input to the CA1 pyramidal neurons when the interstimulus interval (ISI) of the pairs was short (25 ms) but not when the ISI was long (1,000 ms). 2. Paired-pulse stimulation with the short but not with the long ISI also was associated with pronounced inhibition of pyramidal cell firing upon the second pulse of a pair, despite the fact that the excitatory input was facilitated with the short-ISI paradigm. The inhibition of pyramidal cell activity was mediated by input to the pyramidal cells from local gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-releasing interneurons activated by commissural fibers and/or CA1 recurrent collaterals, because the inhibition was eliminated by local administration of the selective GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline (50 microM), near the recording site. 3. Postsynaptic input from GABAergic interneurons was necessary for the induction of LTD, because short-ISI paired-pulse stimulation failed to produce LTD in the presence of bicuculline. 4. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitation also was necessary for the induction of LTD, because administration of the selective NMDA receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonvaleric acid (100 microM), near the recording site prevented the development of LTD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </jats:p>",0

Role of serotonergic input to the ventrolateral medulla in expression of the 10-Hz sympathetic nerve rhythm,"<jats:p> We studied the changes in inferior cardiac sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) produced by unilateral microinjections of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor agonists and antagonists into the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) of urethane-anesthetized, baroreceptor-denervated cats. Microinjection of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist LY-53857 (10 mM) into either the rostral or caudal VLM significantly reduced ( P ≤ 0.05) the 10-Hz rhythmic component of basal SND without affecting its lower-frequency, aperiodic component. The selective depression of 10-Hz power was accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Microinjection of LY-53857 into the VLM also attenuated the increase in 10-Hz power that followed tetanic stimulation of depressor sites in the caudal medullary raphé nuclei. Microinjection of the 5-HT2 receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)2-amino-propane (DOI; 10 μM) into the VLM selectively enhanced 10-Hz SND, and intravenous DOI (1 mg/kg) partially reversed the reduction in 10-Hz SND produced by 5-HT2 receptor blockade in the VLM. Microinjection of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di- n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OHDPAT; 10 mM), into either the rostral or caudal VLM also selectively attenuated 10-Hz SND and significantly reduced MAP. The reduction in 10-Hz SND produced by 8-OHDPAT was partially reversed by intravenous WAY-100635 (1 mg/kg), which selectively blocks 5-HT1A receptors. These results support the view that serotonergic inputs to the VLM play an important role in expression of the 10-Hz rhythm in SND. </jats:p>",0
"Puberty, Ovarian Steroids, and Stress","<jats:p><jats:bold>A<jats:sc>bstract</jats:sc>: </jats:bold> Puberty is accompanied by a number of changes, among them increased risk for development of major depression. The most common etiology of major depression is stressful life events, being present in approximately 90% of first episodes of depression. The hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the major systems involved in responses to stress, and this system is clearly influenced by ovarian hormones. Normal women demonstrate resistance to negative feedback of both cortisol in the fast‐feedback paradigm and dexamethasone in the standard delayed‐feedback paradigm. Depressed premenopausal women show greater increases in baseline cortisol than postmenopausal depressed women and than depressed men. Studies in rodents suggest a similar resistance to glucocorticoid feedback but suggest that estradiol can function to inhibit stress responsiveness. Studies of premenopausal depressed women demonstrate lower estradiol, which suggests that there is less inhibitory feedback of estradiol on the HPA axis, while normal progesterone continues to augment stress responses further. The onset of these reproductive hormonal changes modulating stress systems at puberty may sensitize girls to stressful life events, which become more frequent at the transition to puberty and young adulthood.</jats:p>",0

Effects of GABA and Some GABA Analogues on Respiratory Regulation in the Preterm Rabbit,"<jats:p>Preterm neonatal rabbits (gestational age 29 days) were given GABA (750 mg/kg) or the GABA-like drugs muscimol (2 mg/kg) and GHBA (375 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Basal respiration and the ventilatory response to 10% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were studied, before and after drug administration, in a whole body plethysmograph during halothane anesthesia. The three drugs tested all caused a decrease in minute volume. The decrease in minute volume was mainly due to a decrease in tidal volume after GABA and muscimol, while GHBA reduced minute volume due to a decrease in respiratory frequency. A decrease in respiratory frequency was also seen after muscimol administration. Changes in the respiratory time intervals were seen after muscimol and GHBA both causing significant increases in expiratory and respiratory time. ‘Inspiratory drive’ and ‘respiratory timing mechanisms’ were evaluated by V&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;ι&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;TOT&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. GABA and muscimol reduced both V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; and Tι/T&lt;sub&gt;TOT&lt;/sub&gt; while GHBA only reduced T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;TOT&lt;/sub&gt; Addition of 10% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the inhalation gas caused an increase in tidal volume and minute volume during control conditions. This response to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was abolished by GABA and GHBA treatment. Our findings demonstrate that GABA and GABA-like drugs cause respiratory depression in the preterm neonate. Central mechanisms are most likely involved in this response. These findings may be relevant to the irregular or apneic breathing sometimes seen in the preterm human infant.</jats:p>",0
Sarcolemmal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction,"<jats:p> Because the Na+ pump is considered to modulate the contractile force development by the cardiac muscle and depressed cardiac pump function is the hallmark of congestive heart failure, we characterized the sarcolemmal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in failing rat hearts after myocardial infarction. For this purpose, the left ventricular coronary artery was ligated, and hearts were examined 4, 8, and 16 wk later; sham-operated animals served as controls. Hemodynamic assessment revealed the presence of abnormal cardiac function at 4, 8, and 16 wk. Although accumulation of ascites in the abdominal cavity was present in experimental animals at 4 wk, other clinical signs of congestive heart failure in experimental rats including lung congestion and cardiac dilatation were evident 8 and 16 wk after induction of myocardial infarction. The depression in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in purified sarcolemmal membrane from the uninfarcted experimental left ventricle at 8 wk was associated with depressed Vmax without any changes in the affinities for Mg-ATP, Na+, and K+ or the pH optimum for the enzyme. The Kd values of both the high- and low-affinity binding sites for [3H]ouabain, which is believed to interact with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, were increased; however, no change in the density of either class of ouabain binding site was evident. The depression of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in failing hearts at 16 wk of myocardial infarction was not different from that observed at 8 wk but the enzyme activity was not altered at 4 wk of coronary occlusion. These data support the view that depression of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity may serve as an adaptive mechanism during the development of congestive heart failure. </jats:p>",0

Effects of a high-fat diet and bamboo extract supplement on anxiety- and depression-like neurobehaviours in mice,"<jats:p>High-fat diet is a major causative factor of overweight and obesity, which are associated with an increased risk of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as anxiety and depression. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of bamboo extract (BEX) on anxiety- and depression-like neurobehaviours in mice treated with a high-fat diet. Male mice with CD-1 genetic background were treated for 2 months with either a standard or a high-fat diet (10 or 45 % energy from fat, respectively), with or without the BEX supplement (11 g dry mass per 17 MJ). The anxiety levels of mice were evaluated using open-field and hole-board tests, and depression was measured using the force-swimming test. The anxiety responses of the animals were found significantly increased after the high-fat diet treatment, and this elevation was effectively abolished by the BEX supplement. The high-fat diet seemed to have an anti-depressive effect in mice at the tested time point, but the effect of the BEX supplement on the depression level of the animals was not conclusive. The high-fat diet significantly decreased total glutathione content in the blood while the BEX supplement increased glutathione oxidation. In summary, the present study shows that decreased total glutathione concentration in the blood co-occurred with a high-fat treatment, high anxiety level and low depression level in mice, and when supplemented in a high-fat diet, BEX had an anxiolytic effect in mice.</jats:p>",1

"Effect of actinomycin D, mitomycin C, puromycin, and cycloheximide on desoxycorticosterone‐induced in vitro maturation in oocytes of the catfish, <i>Heteropneustes fossilis</i> (Bloch)","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Actinomycin D and mitomycin C, inhibitors of DNA‐dependent RNA synthesis, were ineffective in blocking desoxycorticosterone (DOC)‐induced in vitro maturation in oocytes of the catfish, <jats:italic>Heteropneustes fossilis</jats:italic> (Bloch). This suggests that a concurrent mRNA synthesis is not obligatory for DOC‐induced maturation. On the other hand, cycloheximide and puromycin, inhibitors of protein synthesis, effectively blocked DOC‐induced oocyte maturation; the former was effective at much lower concentrations than the latter. Further, cycloheximide or puromycin completely blocked oocyte maturation when introduced to the culture medium simultaneously with, or within the first three hours of addition of DOC. As the introduction of the inhibitors to the culture medium was delayed, a progressively larger number of oocytes completed the process of maturation. These results indicate that DOC‐induced maturation in the catfish oocytes is contingent upon protein synthesis which takes place within the first three to four hours of DOC stimulation.</jats:p>",0

Endothelium-dependent relaxation and hyperpolarization in aorta from control and renal hypertensive rats.,"<jats:p>Endothelium-dependent relaxations are depressed in hypertension. In this study we investigated the possible involvement of endothelium-dependent smooth muscle hyperpolarization in this phenomenon. In isolated aortic segments from control rats, acetylcholine (10(-8)-10(-5) M) elicits relaxations after precontraction with norepinephrine (10(-7) M), and acetylcholine or carbachol (10(-5) M) induce smooth muscle hyperpolarization (10.6 +/- 0.9 mV). Both effects disappear after removal of the endothelium and are depressed by tetraethylammonium (3 x 10(-3) M), a rather nonspecific blocker of K+ channels, but not by glibenclamide (10(-5) M), a potent blocker of the ATP-regulated K+ channels, which has a marked effect on the relaxation induced by BRL 38227. The relaxation effect of acetylcholine is impaired in norepinephrine-contracted preparations from hypertensive rats but is not further depressed by tetraethylammonium. In aorta from hypertensive rats, hyperpolarization induced by carbachol was significantly reduced to a mean of only 21.8% of the values obtained in preparations from normotensive rats. From the relaxation-hyperpolarization relation obtained with BRL 38227 (opening K+ channels), it is derived that the endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (approximately 10 mV) contributes for at least 20-30% of the maximal relaxation effect of acetylcholine on rat aorta. It is concluded that the diminished endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization may contribute to the depression of the endothelium-dependent relaxation in hypertension.</jats:p>",0

Regulation of Kainate Receptors by cAMP-Dependent Protein Kinase and Phosphatases,"<jats:p>In the mammalian central nervous system, receptors for excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters such as the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-kainate receptor mediate a large fraction of excitatory transmission. Currents induced by activation of the AMPA-kainate receptor were potentiated by agents that specifically stimulate adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity or were supported by intracellular application of the catalytic subunit of PKA by itself or in combination with cAMP. Furthermore, depression of these currents by a competitive inhibitor of PKA indicates that AMPA-kainate receptors are regulated by endogenous PKA. Endogenous protein phosphatases also regulate these receptors because an inhibitor of cellular phosphatases enhanced kainate currents. Modulation of PKA and phosphatases may regulate the function of these receptors and thus contribute to synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons.</jats:p>",0

Paired‐pulse depression of monosynaptic GABA‐mediated inhibitory postsynaptic responses in rat hippocampus.,"<jats:p>1. Intracellular recording techniques were used to characterize monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and currents (IPSCs) in rat hippocampal slices and to study the mechanism of paired‐pulse depression of these synaptic responses. This was achieved by stimulation in stratum radiatum close (less than 0.5 mm) to an intracellularly recorded CA1 neurone after pharmacological blockade of all excitatory synaptic transmission. 2. Under these conditions, low‐frequency stimulation (0.033 Hz) evoked a pure biphasic IPSP, which had a short and constant latency to onset. This IPSP was blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 microM) suggesting that it resulted from the electrical stimulation of the axons and/or cell bodies of a monosynaptic inhibitory pathway. 3. Picrotoxin (100 microM) abolished the early component of the biphasic IPSP/C. It left an intact, pure late IPSP/C (IPSP/CB) which had a latency to onset of 29 +/‐ 2 ms, latency to peak of 139 +/‐ 4 ms, a duration of 723 +/‐ 135 (range 390‐1730) ms and a reversal potential of ‐93 +/‐ 2 mV. The duration was highly dependent on the stimulus intensity whereas the latency to onset was largely independent of the stimulus intensity. The IPSP/CB was reduced or abolished by 1 mM‐phaclofen. 4. Phaclofen (1 mM) and 2‐hydroxy‐saclofen (0.1‐1.0 mM) reversibly depressed (60‐100%) the late component of the biphasic IPSP/C and, where maximally effective, left a pure, early IPSP/C (IPSP/CA). The IPSP/CA had a latency to onset of 3 ms or less, a latency to peak of 17 +/‐ 1 ms, a duration of 225 +/‐ 3 ms and a reversal potential of ‐75 +/‐ 2 mV. 5. Two shocks of identical strength were applied in close succession to characterize, and to study the mechanisms underlying, frequency‐dependent depression of inhibitory synaptic responses. Paired‐pulse depression was seen for both phases of the biphasic IPSP/C and of the pure IPSP/CB, recorded in the presence of picrotoxin. Paired‐pulse depression was not accompanied by changes in the reversal potential of either component, indicating that it was caused by a reduction in the two synaptic conductances. Paired‐pulse depression was greater when high stimulus intensities were employed. 6. Paired stimuli were applied at separation intervals of between 5 ms and 10 s to determine the temporal profile of frequency‐dependent depression. Paired‐pulse depression of both IPSCA and IPSCB was most pronounced at an interstimulus interval of 100‐125 ms and ceased to occur at intervals greater than 5 10s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</jats:p>",0

Pattern Generation for Walking and Searching Movements of a Stick Insect Leg. II. Control of Motoneuronal Activity,"<jats:p>In the stick insect, Cuniculina impigra, intracellular recordings from mesothoracic motoneurons that control flexion and extension of the tibia and depression and levation of the trochantero-femur were made while the leg performed walking-like movements on a treadband or stereotyped rhythmic searching movements. We were interested in how synaptic input and intrinsic properties contribute to form the activity pattern of motoneurons during rhythmic leg movements without sensory feedback from other legs. During searching and walking, motoneurons expressed a rhythmic bursting pattern that was formed by a depolarizing input followed by a hyperpolarizing input in the inter-burst interval. This basic pattern was similar in all fast, semi-fast, and slow motoneurons that were recorded. Hyperpolarizations were in synchrony with activity in the antagonistic motoneurons. De- and hyperpolarizations were associated with a decrease in input resistance. All motoneurons showed spike frequency adaptation when depolarized by current injection to a membrane potential similar to that observed during walking. In the hyperpolarizing phase of fast flexor motoneurons, the initial maximum hyperpolarization was followed by a sag in potential toward more depolarized values. Consistent with this observation, only fast flexor motoneurons developed a depolarizing sag potential when hyperpolarized by injection of constant negative current.</jats:p>",0
Isoflurane Decreases ATP Sensitivity of Guinea Pig Cardiac Sarcolemmal KATPChannel at Reduced Intracellular pH,"<jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Volatile anesthetics can protect the myocardium against ischemic injury by opening the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (K(atp)) channels. However, direct evidence for anesthetic-channel interaction is still limited, and little is known about the role K(atp) channel modulators play in this effect. Because pH is one of the regulators of K(atp) channels, the authors tested the hypothesis that intracellular pH (pHi) modulates the direct interaction of isoflurane with the cardiac K(atp) channel.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The effects of isoflurane on sarcolemmal K(atp) channels were investigated at pHi 7.4 and pHi 6.8 in excised inside-out membrane patches from ventricular myocytes of guinea pig hearts.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>At pHi 7.4, intracellular ATP (1-1,000 microm) inhibited K(atp) channels and decreased channel open probability (Po) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) of 8 +/- 1.5 microm, and isoflurane (0.5 mm) either had no effect or decreased channel activity. Lowering pHi from 7.4 to 6.8 enhanced channel opening by increasing Po and reduced channel sensitivity to ATP, with IC shifting from 8 +/- 1.2 to 45 +/- 5.6 microm. When applied to the channels activated at pHi 6.8, isoflurane (0.5 mm) increased Po and further reduced ATP sensitivity, shifting IC(50) to 110 +/- 10.0 microm.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Changes in pHi appear to modulate isoflurane interaction with the cardiac K(atp) channel. At pHi 6.8, which itself facilitates channel opening, isoflurane enhances channel activity by increasing Po and reduces sensitivity to inhibition by ATP without changing the unitary amplitude of single channel current or the conductance. These results support the hypothesis of direct isoflurane-K(atp) channel interaction that may play a role in cardioprotection by volatile anesthetics.</jats:p>

cAMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Mediates Activity-Regulated Synaptic Targeting of NMDA Receptors,"<jats:p>Chronic activity blockade increases synaptic levels of NMDA receptor immunoreactivity in hippocampal neurons. We show here that blockade-induced synaptic NMDA receptors are functional and mediate enhanced excitotoxicity in response to synaptically released glutamate. Activity blockade increased the cell surface association of NMDA receptors. Blockade-induced synaptic targeting of NMDA receptors did not require protein synthesis but required phosphorylation and specifically cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Furthermore, activation of PKA was sufficient to induce synaptic targeting of NMDA receptors regardless of receptor activity status. These results implicate PKA activity downstream of receptor blockade as a mediator of enhanced synaptic transport or stabilization of NMDA receptors. Synaptic clustering of NR1-green fluorescent protein was observed in living neurons in response to NMDA receptor and cAMP phosphodiesterase antagonists and occurred gradually over the course of a day. This pathway represents a cellular mechanism for synaptic homeostasis and is likely to function in metaplasticity, long-term regulation of the ability of a synapse to undergo potentiation or depression.</jats:p>",0

CNTF inhibits high voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in fetal mouse cortical neurones,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Neurotrophic factors yield neuroprotection by mechanisms that may be related to their effects as inhibitors of apoptosis as well as their effects on ion channels. The effect of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) on high‐threshold voltage‐activated Ca channels in cultured fetal mouse brain cortical neurones was investigated. Addition of CNTF into serum‐free growth medium resulted in delayed reduction of the Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> currents. The currents decreased to 50% after 4 h and stabilized at this level during incubation with CNTF for 48 h. Following removal of CNTF the inhibition was completely reversed after 18 h. CNTF reduced the current of all pharmacological subtypes of Ca channels as shown by use of selective blockers of L, N, and P/Q type Ca channels (nifedipine, ω‐conotoxin MVIIA, ω‐agatoxin IVA). The Ca channel depression was mediated via the CNTF receptor, because enzymatic cleavage of the α‐subunit glycerophosphatidylinositol anchor of the receptor eliminated the response. The CNTF effect was not elicited through pertussis toxin‐sensitive G proteins. Other neurotrophic factors like neurotrophin‐3 and insulin‐like growth factor‐I had no effect on the Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> currents. These results may have important implications for the possible functions of CNTF in the nervous system, such as altered synaptic activity, neuronal excitability and susceptibility to brain ischaemia.</jats:p>",0

            <jats:p>Cats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and alpha-chloralose and artificially ventilated. Respiratory output was evaluated by phasic inspiratory activity of the phrenic nerve. In 12 cats, this activity was measured during inhalation of an hypoxic gas mixture with halothane, 0, 0.1, and 0.8%, with intact or denervated carotid bodies. In 10 cats, a carotid body was isolated from the systemic circulation and perfused with hypoxic Krebs-Ringer solution equilibrated with halothane, 0, 0.1, and 0.8%.</jats:p>

Short- and long-term synaptic depression in rat neostriatum,"<jats:p> 1. We have examined plasticity at glutamatergic synapses on neurons in slices of neostriatum, a forebrain area involved in movement and cognitive function. 2. High-frequency stimulation of afferent inputs to neostriatal neurons induced depression of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Depression could be induced using either prolonged trains or short repetitive bursts of high-frequency stimulation. Depression developed within seconds after such stimulation. Responses recovered to baseline levels within 10 min in most slices but persisted for up to 60 min in others. 3. Postsynaptic passive electrical properties and the ability to elicit action potentials by postsynaptic depolarization were not altered during depression. 4. The magnitude and time course of depression was similar whether postsynaptic responses were mediated by alpha amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptors. Depression was not altered by antagonism of AMPA or NMDA receptors or potentiation of AMPA receptor function with aniracetam. 5. Depression was blocked by treatments that increase transmitter release including increased extracellular Ca2+, application of 4-aminopyridine, or application of phorbol ester. 6. Our findings indicate that glutamatergic synapses in neostriatum are capable of expressing a form of synaptic depression that may involve decreased glutamate release. </jats:p>",0

Lamotrigine ameliorates seizures and psychiatric comorbidity in a rat model of spontaneous absence epilepsy,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose: </jats:bold> Lamotrigine (LTG) is an effective clinical treatment for epilepsy associated with absence seizures. However, the impact of LTG administration in studies employing various animal models of epilepsy remains controversial. This study aimed to clarify the outcomes of LTG treatment on absence seizures and comorbid anxiety and depression disorders in Long‐Evans rats with spontaneous spike‐wave discharges (SWDs).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods: </jats:bold> LTG (10 mg/kg) or water vehicle was chronically administered perorally to Long‐Evans rats (twice daily for 35 days). Cortical activities were recorded to assess the presence of SWDs. Five behavioral tests, including the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), sucrose consumption (SC), sucrose preference, and forced swimming (FS) tests, were performed after LTG/vehicle treatment. The behavioral indexes of these tests were designed to assess anxiety (OF and EPM tests), depression (SC and FS tests), and preference for hedonistic stimuli (sugar preference test).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Key Findings: </jats:bold> Total SWD duration, SWD number, and mean SWD duration were significantly decreased in rats that received 35‐day LTG treatment compared with rats that received vehicle treatment. Rats with spontaneous SWDs versus rats with no SWDs showed significant levels of anxiety and depression in the OF, EPM, and SC tests. Rats with SWDs also showed longer immobility in the FS test. However, the LTG‐treated group compared with the vehicle group presented with significantly lower manifestations of anxiety and depression in the OF, EPM, SC, and sucrose preference tests and shorter immobility in the FS test.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Significance: </jats:bold> The results of this study suggest that chronic LTG treatment can benefit patients with epilepsy via suppression of absence seizures and amelioration of comorbid anxiety and depression.</jats:p>",1
Regulation of plasticity of glutamate synapses by endocannabinoids and the cyclic‐AMP/protein kinase A pathway in midbrain dopamine neurons,"<jats:p>Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are lipid signalling molecules which play a key role in the regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. Previous studies have reported that eCBs are released ‘on demand’ in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a brain region critical for reward learning. However, their role in modulating the long‐term plasticity of glutamate synapses of VTA dopamine (DA) neurons remains unknown. In the present study, we showed that low frequency afferent stimulation paired with moderate postsynaptic depolarization elicited an <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>‐methyl‐<jats:sc>d</jats:sc>‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor‐independent long‐term depression (LTD) at glutamate synapses of VTA DA neurons. This form of LTD was caused by a decrease in the probability of glutamate release. Examination of the mechanisms underlying this form of LTD revealed that it was mediated by retrograde eCB signalling. In addition, we found that inhibition of 2‐arachidonoyl glycerol biosynthesis blocked LTD induction, suggesting that 2‐arachidonoyl glycerol is the most likely retrograde eCB messenger mediating LTD. The eCB‐LTD induced at glutamate synapses of VTA DA neurons also required the inhibition of the presynaptic cAMP/PKA pathway. Taken together, these results reveal a critical role of eCBs in controlling the long‐term plasticity of glutamate synapses in VTA DA neurons.</jats:p>",0
"Efficiency of selection, as measured by single nucleotide polymorphism variation, is dependent on inbreeding rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>It is often hypothesized that slow inbreeding causes less inbreeding depression than fast inbreeding at the same absolute level of inbreeding. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include the more efficient purging of deleterious alleles and more efficient selection for heterozygote individuals during slow, when compared with fast, inbreeding. We studied the impact of inbreeding rate on the loss of heterozygosity and on morphological traits in <jats:italic>Drosophila melanogaster</jats:italic>. We analysed five noninbred control lines, 10 fast inbred lines and 10 slow inbred lines; the inbred lines all had an expected inbreeding coefficient of approximately 0.25. Forty single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA coding regions were genotyped, and we measured the size and shape of wings and counted the number of sternopleural bristles on the genotyped individuals. We found a significantly higher level of genetic variation in the slow inbred lines than in the fast inbred lines. This higher genetic variation was resulting from a large contribution from a few loci and a smaller effect from several loci. We attributed the increased heterozygosity in the slow inbred lines to the favouring of heterozygous individuals over homozygous individuals by natural selection, either by associative over‐dominance or balancing selection, or a combination of both. Furthermore, we found a significant polynomial correlation between genetic variance and wing size and shape in the fast inbred lines. This was caused by a greater number of homozygous individuals among the fast inbred lines with small, narrow wings, which indicated inbreeding depression. Our results demonstrated that the same amount of inbreeding can have different effects on genetic variance depending on the inbreeding rate, with slow inbreeding leading to higher genetic variance than fast inbreeding. These results increase our understanding of the genetic basis of the common observation that slow inbred lines express less inbreeding depression than fast inbred lines. In addition, this has more general implications for the importance of selection in maintaining genetic variation.</jats:p>",0
Inactivation of potassium current in squid axon by a variety of quaternary ammonium ions.,"<jats:p>The characteristics of potassium channel block by a diverse group of quaternary ammonium (QA) ions was examined in squid axons. Altering the size and nature of the head and/or tail groups of the QA ions applied internally produced only quantitative differences in the potassium current block. Although their entry rate is diminished, compounds with head groups as large as 11 X 12 A are capable of occluding the channel, whereas the smallest QA ions, with head groups approximately 5 X 6 A, are not potent blockers. When one or three terminal hydrogens of the head group were replaced by hydroxyl moieties, the compound's blocking ability was diminished, suggesting that QA binding is not improved by hydrogen bonding at these positions. QA ions bound to their site within the potassium channel with 1:1 stoichiometry, and the site is perhaps 20% or more of the distance through the membrane electric field. Raising external potassium concentration did not alter the steady-state or kinetic features of the QA block of outward potassium currents; however, increasing temperature or adding Ba2+ internally increased the rate of decay of the QA-blocked currents. From the structure-function analysis of the QA ions, projections concerning both the architecture of the potassium channel's inner mouth and the significance of various chemical constituents of the ions were made. The potassium channel may now be pictured as having a wider mouth (up to 11 X 12 A) extending to the QA binding site and then narrowing quickly to the region of channel selectivity. Important alterations that improve the blocking ability of the compounds include: (a) lengthening the alkyl hydrocarbon tail group (up to 10 carbon), (b) lengthening a second hydrocarbon chain of the head group (e.g., decyldimethylphenylammonium bromide [C10DM phi]), and (c) adding a carbonyl moiety to the tail (e.g., ambutonium).</jats:p>",0

Molecular mechanisms of lymphocyte extravasation. III. The loss of lymphocyte extravasation potential induced by pertussis toxin is not mediated via the activation of protein kinase C.,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>The present study evaluated whether protein kinase C (PKC) activation was involved in the lymphocytosis promoting properties of pertussis toxin (Ptx). The exposure of mouse lymphocytes to phorbol esters (as a means to selectively activate PKC) caused a depression in their subsequent capacity to localize into lymph nodes and Peyer's patches in vivo. This pattern of inhibition was quite similar to that observed with lymphocytes treated with Ptx. The mechanisms responsible for the observed decreases in localization to lymphoid organs caused by these two agents, however, appeared to be distinct. Exposure of lymphocytes to PMA was followed by a time and dosage-dependent decrease in the surface density of MEL-14 defined homing receptors. Ptx-treated lymphocytes retained normal density of this homing receptor. Consequently, PMA-treated lymphocytes lost their capacity to bind to high-endothelial venules in in vitro lymph node binding assays while Ptx-treated cells retained normal high-endothelial venule binding potential. We conclude from this study that: 1) the activation of PKC in lymphocytes by PMA can alter their recirculation properties via mechanisms that diminish their expression of surface receptors which support extravasation into lymph node and mucosal lymphoid tissues, and 2) even though Ptx has been reported to elevate the rate of inositol phosphate turnover in lymphocytes, the loss of extravasation potential of Ptx-treated lymphocytes is not mediated via the modification of surface homing receptors as observed in cells exposed to the known PKC activator, PMA.</jats:p>",0
Pharmacological analysis of the CCK<sub>B</sub>/gastrin receptors mediating pentagastrin‐stimulated gastric acid secretion in the isolated stomach of the immature rat,"<jats:p><jats:list list-type=""explicit-label"">
<jats:list-item><jats:p>The CCK<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>/gastrin receptors mediating pentagastrin stimulation of gastric acid secretion by histamine release and by direct stimulation of oxyntic cells have been characterized in the immature rat isolated stomach assay. This was achieved by estimating antagonist affinity values for competitive antagonists from three distinct chemical classes (L‐365,260, PD 134,308 and JB93190) in the absence and presence of a high concentration of the histamine H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐receptor antagonist, famotidine (30 μ<jats:sc>m</jats:sc>).</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>Pentagastrin produced concentration‐dependent stimulation of gastric acid secretion in the absence and presence of famotidine. Famotidine depressed the maximum secretory response to pentagastrin although the degree of depression varied between experimental replicates (25–60%). This variation was attributed to the histamine‐release mediated component of acid secretion, as judged by the consistency of the maximum responses obtained in the presence, but not absence, of famotidine.</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>All three CCK<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>/gastrin receptor antagonists behaved as surmountable antagonists in the absence and presence of famotidine.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>It was assumed that the famotidine treatment converted pentagastrin‐stimulated acid secretion from a combination of an indirect action due to the release of histamine and a direct action on the oxyntic cell to solely a direct action on the oxyntic cell. A simple mathematical model of this two‐receptor system was developed. The direct and indirect components were assumed to sum to produce the total response to pentagastrin obtained in the absence of famotidine. It was found that this model could account quantitatively for the behaviour of the three antagonists without invoking a difference in antagonist affinity for the CCK<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>/gastrin receptors mediating the direct and indirect actions of pentagastrin. However, a conclusion of receptor homogeneity has to be qualified because the model was also used to generate simulations which indicated that the analysis could only detect antagonist affinity differences of greater than one log‐unit between enterochromaffin‐like (ECL) and oxyntic cell CCK<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>/gastrin receptor populations.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

INHIBITION OF PITUITARY PROLACTIN SECRETION BY HUMAN PLACENTAL LACTOGEN IN RATS,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title>
        <jats:p>Intact female rats given twice daily injections of 1 mg human placental lactogen (HPL) showed continued dioestrous vaginal smears and their ovarian corpora lutea were found to be hypertrophied and functional. The serum prolactin level was significantly lower in these rats than in the controls at dioestrus as well as at pro-oestrus. Twice-daily injections of 0·5 or 2 mg HPL to ovariectomized rats decreased serum and pituitary levels of prolactin and increased hypothalamic activity of prolactin inhibiting hormone, although the effect was less at the lower dose. Human placental lactogen had no direct effect on pituitary prolactin secretion <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. These findings have demonstrated that HPL, like prolactin itself, inhibits prolactin secretion by acting indirectly on the pituitary through the hypothalamus.</jats:p>",0

However, postsynaptic dialysis of the G-protein inhibitor had no effect on DAMGO-induced initial inhibition and long-term potentiation (LTP) in either lamina I or II neurons. DAMGO-induced LTP was associated with an increase in the paired-pulse depression ratio. Furthermore, DAMGO application and washout induced an initial decrease followed by a persistent increase in the frequency of miniature EPSCs. Bath application, but not postsynaptic dialysis, of an NMDA receptor antagonist or a calcium chelator abolished DAMGO-induced LTP. Strikingly, ablation of TRPV1-expressing primary afferents not only eliminated DAMGO-induced LTP but also prolonged DAMGO-induced inhibition of the miniature and evoked EPSCs (i.e., long-term depression). Thus, our study strongly suggests that TRPV1-expressing primary afferents play a prominent role in opioid-induced presynaptic LTP, which challenges a previous report suggesting the postsynaptic nature of this opioid-induced LTP. This excitatory effect of opioids on primary afferents can counteract the inhibitory effect of opioids on synaptic transmission at the spinal level and is likely involved in opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance.</jats:p>",0
The influence of pulsed magnetic fields (PMFs) on nonsynaptic potentials recorded from the central and peripheral nervous systems in vitro,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The influence of pulsed magnetic fields (PMFs) on nonsynaptic potentials recorded from the central and peripheral nervous system in vitro has been investigated. The population spikes (PSs) recorded from hippocampal slices during antidromic stimulation and compound action potentials (CAPs) recorded from the segments of the sciatic nerve were used as indicators of neuronal activity. The potentials recorded from both preparations were significantly and permanently enhanced following PMF (0.16 Hz, 15 mT) exposure. The increase in the antidromic PS occurred even in the presence of potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) and was accompanied by multiple spiking. Among all frequencies of PMF tested (0.5, 0.16, 0.07, 0.03, 0.0 Hz), the frequency of 0.5 Hz was the most effective in enhancement of potential amplitude. The influence of PMF on the amplitude of two CAPs evoked by the pair of electrical stimuli applied in rapid succession has also been evaluated. In control conditions the potential triggered by the second stimuli was slightly smaller expressing the phenomenon of short‐term depression (STD). Although PMF exposure amplified the amplitude of both potentials, the increase in the size of the first potential was significantly greater increasing further the magnitude of STD. The blocking of potassium channels reversed STD into facilitation. One of the possible mechanisms involved in PMF action could be the modification of the axonal threshold, which was significantly reduced following exposure to PMF.

Response of upper airway and chest wall muscles to selective brain stem hypoxia in the newborn,"<jats:p> In animals with intact peripheral chemosensory afferents, hypoxia differentially affects upper airway (UA) and chest wall muscles. To determine the contribution of brain stem (BS) hypoxia to the response of UA and chest wall muscles during early life, we perfused the BS through a vertebral artery intermittently with blood from an extracorporeal circuit in nine newborn piglets (age 1–5 days). BS perfusions were performed with hypoxemic blood (arterial PO2 32 +/- 6 to 38 +/- 8 Torr) with different levels of BS PCO2 (28 +/- 2, 37 +/- 4, and 56 +/- 5 Torr) while systemic normocapnic hyperoxia was maintained (arterial PCO2 36 +/- 3 to 40 +/- 6 Torr, arterial PO2 345 +/- 73 to 392 +/- 37 Torr). Electromyograms (EMGs) of alae nasi (AN), external intercostal (EI), and diaphragm (DIA) were recorded. Normocapnic hypoxia of the BS induced a sustained increase in AN EMG (P &lt; 0.01, analysis of variance) and depression of EI and DIA EMGs without a transient increase. These contrasting responses were also observed during hypocapnic and hypercapnic hypoxia of the BS and were not affected by inputs from the peripheral chemoreceptors or rostral cerebral structures that were not exposed to hypoxia. We conclude that, despite eliciting the known central respiratory depression, BS hypoxia causes an increase in the respiratory drive to an UA airway muscle. Thus, BS hypoxia elicits a selective rather than a generalized respiratory muscle depression. The respiratory muscles with high energy expenditure (DIA and EI) are depressed while UA muscles are stimulated or disinhibited. This response is independent of the level of BS arterial PCO2. </jats:p>",0

Heparin pretreatment suppresses norepinephrine concentrations in dogs in endotoxic shock.,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Mongrel dogs were treated intravenously with either 1000 units of beef-lung heparin per kilogram of body weight or with isotonic saline, before intravenous administration of E. coli endotoxin. We found significant differences in circulating norepinephrine concentrations between a heparin-pretreatment group (1.89 +/- 0.39 microgram/liter) and the control group (9.83 +/- 4.64 microgram/liter), but none with respect to epinephrine. Systolic blood pressures at 360 min were also significantly (P less than 0.05) different, 148 +/- 6 mmHg as compared with 118 +/- 13.4 mmHg. Evidently heparin pretreatment can decrease circulating norepinephrine concentrations in the endotoxic state and changes in circulating catecholamine concentrations can affect physiological variables.</jats:p>",0

Gene expression patterns in a rodent model for depression,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Disturbances in sleep are encountered in the majority of patients with depression. To elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms behind this relationship we examined gene expression changes in a rodent model for depression and disturbed sleep. Animals were treated with daily injections of clomipramine in their early infancy, after which gene expression in basal forebrain was examined using Affymetrix Rat 230.2 chips. We tested the levels of both single transcripts and involved pathways, and searched for common nominators (i.e. transcription factors) that could explain these changes. We identified 72 differentially expressed gene transcripts, many of which are involved in epigenetic regulation, such as <jats:italic>DNMT2</jats:italic>. Analysis of functional pathways revealed statistically significant changes of the biological process of synaptic transmission, the cellular compartment of the synapse and the molecular function of GABA signalling, showing that transcripts with altered expression are functionally related. Finally, promoter analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed a clear enrichment of binding sites for the transcription factor CREB1, a molecule also involved in epigenetic regulation (cAMP response element‐binding protein induces histone modifications). These results indicate that CREB1 may constitute one of the major links between disturbed sleep and mood. The results also highlight the molecular mechanisms in the murine clomipramine model, previously shown to be a valid model for depression.</jats:p>",1

BACE1 Knock-Outs Display Deficits in Activity-Dependent Potentiation of Synaptic Transmission at Mossy Fiber to CA3 Synapses in the Hippocampus,"<jats:p>β-Amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) has been identified as a major neuronal β-secretase critical for the formation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, which is thought responsible for the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, BACE1 is one of the key therapeutic targets that can prevent the progression of AD. Previous studies showed that knocking out the BACE1 gene prevents Aβ formation, but results in behavioral deficits and specific synaptic dysfunctions at Schaffer collateral to CA1 synapses. However, BACE1 protein is most highly expressed at the mossy fiber projections in CA3. Here, we report that BACE1 knock-out mice display reduced presynaptic function, as measured by an increase in paired-pulse facilitation ratio. More dramatically, mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP), which is normally expressed via an increase in presynaptic release, was eliminated in the knock-outs. Although long-term depression was slightly larger in the BACE1 knock-outs, it could not be reversed. The specific deficit in mossy fiber LTP was upstream of cAMP signaling and could be “rescued” by transiently elevating extracellular Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>concentration. These results suggest that BACE1 may play a critical role in regulating presynaptic function, especially activity-dependent strengthening of presynaptic release, at mossy fiber synapses.</jats:p>",0
Inhibition of long‐term potentiation by CuZn superoxide dismutase injection in rat dentate gyrus: Involvement of muscarinic M1 receptor,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Long‐term potentiation (LTP) and long‐term depression represent important processes that modulate synaptic transmission that carries out a key role in neural mechanisms of memory. Many studies give strong evidences on a role of the reactive oxygen species in the induction of LTP in CA1 region of hippocampal slices that was inhibited by adding the scavenger enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Previous data showed that SOD1 is secreted by many cellular lines, including neuroblastoma SK‐N‐BE cells through microvesicles by an ATP‐dependent mechanism; moreover, it has been shown that SOD1 interacts with human neuroblastoma cell membranes increasing intracellular calcium levels via a phospholipase C–protein kinase C pathway activation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intracerebral injection of SOD1 or the inactive form of enzyme (ApoSOD) on the modulation of synaptic transmission in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in urethane anesthetized rats. The results of the present research showed that intracerebral injection of SOD1 and ApoSOD in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampal formation inhibits LTP induced by high‐frequency stimulation of the perforant path. This result cannot be only explained by the dismutation of oxygen radical induced by SOD1 since also ApoSOD, that lacks the enzymatic activity, carries out the same inhibitory effect on LTP induction.

Cholecystokinin inhibits evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the rat nucleus accumbens indirectly through γ‐aminobutyric acid and γ‐aminobutyric acid type B receptors,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We recently reported that cholecystokinin (CCK) excited nucleus accumbens (NAc) cells and depressed excitatory synaptic transmission indirectly through γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), acting on presynaptic GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> receptors (Kombian et al. [<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#bib20"">2004</jats:ext-link>] J. Physiol. 555:71–84). The present study tested the hypothesis that CCK modulates inhibitory synaptic transmission in the NAc. Using in vitro forebrain slices containing the NAc and whole‐cell patch recording, we examined the effects of CCK on evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded at a holding potential of −80 mV throughout CCK‐8S caused a reversible inward current accompanied by a concentration‐dependent decrease in evoked IPSC amplitude. Maximum IPSC depression was ∼25% at 10 μM, with an estimated EC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> of 0.1 μM. At 1 μM, CCK‐8S induced an inward current of 28.3 ± 4.8 pA (n = 6) accompanied by an IPSC depression of −18.8% ± 1.6% (n = 6). This CCK‐induced IPSC depression was blocked by pretreatment with proglumide (100 μM; −3.7% ± 6.9%; n = 4) and by LY225910 (100 nM), a selective CCK<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> receptor antagonist (4.4% ± 2.6%; n = 4). It was not blocked by SCH23390 (10 μM; −23.5% ± 1.3%; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05; n = 7) or sulpiride (10 μM; −21.8% ± 5.1%; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05; n = 4), dopamine receptor antagonists. By contrast, it was blocked by CGP55845 (1 μM; −0.4% ± 3.4%; n = 5) a potent GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> receptor antagonist, and by forskolin (50 μM; 9.9% ± 5.2%; n = 4), an adenylyl cyclase activator, and H‐89 (1 μM; 6.9% ± 3.9%; n = 4), a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. These results indicate that CCK acts on CCK<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> receptors to increase extracellular levels of GABA, which then acts on GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> receptors to decrease IPSC amplitude. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",0
Biting releases constraints on moray eel feeding kinematics,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>We present an analysis of prey capture functional morphology in eels by comparing two species of moray eels, Muraena retifera and Echidna nebulosa (Family Muraenidae), to the American eel Anguilla rostrata (Family Anguillidae). The skulls of both moray species exhibited extreme reductions of several prominent components of the suction-feeding mechanism, including the hyoid bar, the sternohyoideus muscle and the pectoral girdle. Associated with these anatomical modifications, morays showed no evidence of using suction during prey capture. From 59 video sequences of morays feeding on pieces of cut squid we saw no hyoid depression and no movement of prey toward the mouth aperture during the strike, a widely used indicator of suction-induced water flow. This was in contrast to A. rostrata, which exhibited a robust hyoid, sternohyoideus muscle and pectoral girdle, and used suction to draw prey into its mouth. Average prey capture time in morays, about 500 ms, was roughly 10 times longer than in A. rostrata, and morays frequently reversed the direction of jaw and head rotation in the midst of the strike. We tested whether the absence of suction feeding reduces temporal constraints on feeding kinematics, permitting greater variance in traits that characterize timing and the extent of motion in the neurocranium, by comparing moray eel species with A. rostrata,two Centrarchids and a cichlid. Kinematic variance was roughly 5 times higher in morays than the suction-feeding species. Prey capture by suction demands a rapid, highly coordinated series of cranial movements and the loss of this mechanism appears to have permitted slower, more variable prey capture kinematics in morays. The alternative prey capture strategy in morays, biting,may be tied to their success as predators in the confined spaces of reef crevices where they hunt for cephalopods, crustaceans and fish.</jats:p>",0

Cortical control of thermogenesis induced by lateral hypothalamic lesion and overeating,"<jats:p> Increased O2 consumption was found in rats after bilateral lesions of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) or during voluntary overeating. This phenomenon appears to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in both conditions, since it is blocked by the beta-blocker propranolol administration. In the first experiment we showed that the brain cortex is involved in the thermogenesis induced by LH lesion and this effect is mediated by SNS, since bilateral functional decortication induced by cortical-spreading depression (CSD) impaired the increase of O2 consumption to the same extent as administration of propranolol. In the second experiment the role played by the cerebral cortex on thermogenesis in rats during voluntary overeating of ""cafeteria"" diet and in control rats was investigated. Cafeteria rats showed a significantly higher colonic temperature, brown adipose tissue temperature (Tbat), and rate of O2 consumption than control animals. CSD led to a significant decrease of Tbat and O2 consumption in cafeteria rats but not in controls. On the basis of the results obtained in the two experiments, the possibility that the cerebral cortex could be involved in the metabolic responses for reduction of body weight to the ""set-point"" is hypothesized. </jats:p>",0

The mechanism of acetylcholine release from parasympathetic nerves,"<jats:p>1. The output of acetylcholine from the plexus of the guinea‐pig ileum longitudinal strip has been used to study the mechanism of acetylcholine release. From the effects of hexamethonium and tetrodotoxin, it was inferred that 60% of the normal resting output is due to propagated activity in the plexus, and 40% to spontaneous release. Tetrodotoxin virtually abolishes the increase in output in response to electrical stimulation.</jats:p><jats:p>2.

A Hierarchical Phosphorylation Cascade That Regulates the Timing of PERIOD Nuclear Entry Reveals Novel Roles for Proline-Directed Kinases and GSK-3β/SGG in Circadian Clocks,"<jats:p>The daily timing of when PERIOD (PER) proteins translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is a critical step in clock mechanisms underpinning circadian rhythms in animals. Numerous lines of evidence indicate that phosphorylation plays a prominent role in regulating various aspects of PER function and metabolism, including changes in its daily stability and subcellular distribution. In this report, we show that phosphorylation of serine 661 (Ser661) by a proline-directed kinase(s) is a key phospho-signal on the<jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic>PER protein (dPER) that regulates the timing of its nuclear accumulation. Mutations that block phosphorylation at Ser661 do not affect dPER stability but delay its nuclear entry in key pacemaker neurons, yielding longer behavioral rhythms. Intriguingly, abolishing phosphorylation at Ser661 also attenuates the extent of dPER hyperphosphorylation<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>, suggesting the phosphorylated state of Ser661 regulates phosphorylation at other sites on dPER. Indeed, we identify Ser657 as a site that is phosphorylated by the glycogen synthase kinase GSK-3β (SHAGGY; SGG) in a manner dependent on priming at Ser661. Although not as dramatic as mutating Ser661, mutations that abolish phosphorylation at Ser657 also lead to longer behavioral periods, suggesting that a multi-kinase hierarchical phosphorylation module regulates the timing of dPER nuclear entry. Together with evidence in mammalian systems, our findings implicate proline-directed kinases in clock mechanisms and suggest that PER proteins are key downstream targets of lithium therapy, a potent inhibitor of GSK-3β used to treat manic depression, a disorder associated with clock malfunction in humans.</jats:p>",0

Cardiorenal Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetic Cognopathy,"<jats:p>The prevalence of the cardiorenal metabolic syndrome (CRS) is increasing in parallel with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and other forms of dementia. Along with metabolic, inflammatory, and immunological abnormalities, there is maladaptive structural remodeling of the heart, kidney, and brain. The term ‘diabetic cognopathy' (DC) may be used when discussing functional and structural changes in the brain of the diabetic patient. DC likely represents an advanced form of these changes in the brain that evolve with increasing duration of the CRS and subsequent clinical diabetes. We posit that DC develops due to a convergence of aging, genetic and lifestyle abnormalities (overnutrition and lack of exercise), which result in multiple injurious metabolic and immunologic toxicities such as dysfunctional immune responses, oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, and dysglycemia (systemically and in the brain). These converging abnormalities may lead to endothelial blood-brain barrier tight junction/adherens junction (TJ/AJ) complex remodeling and microglia activation, which may result in neurodegeneration, impaired cognition, and dementia. Herein, we describe the brain ultrastructural changes evolving from a normal state to maladaptive remodeling in rodent models of CRS including microglia activation/polarization and attenuation and/or loss of the TJ/AJ complexes, pericytes and astrocytes of the neurovascular unit. Further, we discuss the potential relationship between these structural changes and the development of DC, potential therapeutic strategies, and future directions.</jats:p>",0

Early depression of Ankrd2 and Csrp3 mRNAs in the polyribosomal and whole tissue fractions in skeletal muscle with decreased voluntary running,"<jats:p>The wheel-lock (WL) model for depressed ambulatory activity in rats has shown metabolic maladies ensuing within 53–173 h after WL begins. We sought to determine if WL beginning after 21–23 days of voluntary running in growing female Wistar rats affected the mRNA profile in the polyribosomal fraction from plantaris muscle shortly following WL. In experiment 1, WL occurred at 0200 and muscles were harvested at 0700 daily at 5 h (WL5h, n = 4), 29 h (WL29h, n = 4), or 53 h (WL53h, n = 4) after WL. Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST Arrays were used to test the initial question as to whether WL affects mRNA occupancy on skeletal muscle polyribosomes. Using a false discovery rate of 15%, no changes in mRNAs in the polyribosomal fraction were observed at WL29h and eight mRNAs (of over 8,200 identified targets) were altered at WL53h compared with WL5h. Interestingly, two of the six downregulated genes included ankyrin repeat domain 2 (Ankrd2) and cysteine-rich protein 3/muscle LIM protein (Csrp3), both of which encode mechanical stretch sensors and RT-PCR verified their WL-induced decline. In experiment 2, whole muscle mRNA and protein levels were analyzed for Ankrd2 and Csrp3 from the muscles of WL5h (4 original samples + 2 new), WL29h (4 original), WL53h (4 original + 2 new), as well as WL173 h ( n = 6 new) and animals that never ran (SED, 4–5 new). Relative to WL5h controls, whole tissue Ankrd2 and Csrp3 mRNAs were lower ( P &lt; 0.05) at WL53h, WL173h, and SED; Ankrd2 protein tended to decrease at WL53h ( P = 0.054) and Csrp3 protein was less in WL173h and SED rats ( P &lt; 0.05). In summary, unique early declines in Ankrd2 and Csrp3 mRNAs were identified with removal of voluntary running, which was subsequently followed by declines in Csrp3 protein levels during longer periods of wheel lock.</jats:p>",0

<i>In vivo</i>treatment with a monoclonal chimeric anti-CD4 antibody results in prolonged depletion of circulating CD4+ cells in chimpanzees,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Chimeric M-T412 (cM-T412). an anti-CD4 antibody, was tolerated in chimpanzees at a dosage of 5 mg/kg per day for up to 7 consecutive days, or 5 mg/kg per dose, twice weekly for 4 weeks. All cM-T412-treated chimpanzees showed a prolonged CD4 cell depression. Weak chimpanzee antibody responses to chimeric M-T412 were observed. One of the chimpanzees on the biweekly dosage regimen exhibited a hypersensitivity reaction immediately after receiving its seventh dose. Following supportive treatment, the animal recovered and remained asymptomatic during the non-treatment observation period. The hypersensitivity reaction was not an unexpected response considering the animal received repeated intermittent i.v. administration of a foreign protein. This animal also showed a chimpanzee antibody response to chimeric M-T412 after the seventh dose. Chimeric M-T412 also induced an anti-cM-T412 response in some of the other animals. The level of this response was lower than the anti-mouse responses observed in animals treated with murinc anti-CD4. Moreover, the anti-cM-T4l 2 response was mainly directed to idiotypic determinants. The decrease in CD4+ cells observed for all chimeric M-T412-treated chimpanzees is an expected effect of the anti-CD4 antibody. The duration of this CD4+ cell decrease is. however, much longer than observed for other CD4-specific MoAbs described. No selective loss of either memory or naive CD4+ cells was observed after cither the single, 7-day or twice-weekly treatments. The CD4+ cell depression was reversible, although individual variation in time to recovery was observed. Therefore, cM-T412 could be a good candidate for clinical use in autoimmune conditions.</jats:p>",0

Regulation of the GABAA Receptor by Nitric Oxide in Frog Pituitary Melanotrophs*,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the regulation of various endocrine functions, but the effect of NO on GABAA receptor transmission has never been reported in endocrine cells. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of various agents acting on the NO transduction pathway on GABAA receptor function in frog pituitary melanotrophs. Histochemical studies using the NADPH-diaphorase reaction and immunohistochemical labeling with antibodies against neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) revealed that nNOS is expressed in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary and in cultured melanotrophs. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed that the specific substrate of NOS l-arginine (l-Arg, 10−4m) or the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (10−5m) provoked a long-lasting inhibition of the current evoked by GABA (5 × 10−6m). The NOS inhibitor l-nitroarginine (10−5m) produced a biphasic effect, i.e. a transient decrease followed by a delayed increase of the GABA-evoked current amplitude. Similarly, the specific nNOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole and the specific inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor aminoguanidine (10−5m each) provoked a transient depression of the current followed by a sustained potentiation. Formation of cGMP in neurointermediate lobes was enhanced by l-Arg (10−4m) and by the calcium-releasing agent caffeine (10−4m), and inhibited by the calmodulin (CaM)/Ca2+ complex blocker W7 (10−5m). The GABA-evoked current was potentiated by the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ (10−8–10−7m) and inhibited by the protein kinase G (PKG) activator 8pCPT-cGMP (3 × 10−7–3 × 10−5m). The present data indicate that NO, produced by a CaM/Ca2+-dependent NOS in frog melanotrophs, exerts an autocrine inhibitory effect on the GABA-evoked current. The action of NO on the GABAA receptor function is mediated through activation of the cGMP/PKG pathway.</jats:p>",0

Antidepressant behavioral effects of duloxetine and amitriptyline in the rat forced swimming test,"<jats:p>PURPOSE: To compare the effects of the antidepressant drugs duloxetine and amitriptyline on depressive behaviors in rats. METHODS: Fifteen male Wistar rats were given systemic injections of duloxetine, amitriptyline or saline prior to a Forced Swimming Test (FST). Immobility and number of stops were measured. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Kruskall-Wallis. RESULTS: Rats given injections of duloxetine displayed fewer stops than the amitriptyline and control group (p&lt; 0.05). The control group and Amitriptyline showed no difference (p=0.8). CONCLUSION: Duloxetine reduced depressive behaviors in the Forced Swimming Test been more effective than amitriptyline.</jats:p>",1
Anxiolytic and Antidepressant-Like Effects of the Aqueous Extract of<i>Alafia multiflora</i>Stem Barks in Rodents,"<jats:p>The present study examined the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of the aqueous extract of<jats:italic>Alafia multiflora Stapf</jats:italic>(AM) stem barks (150 and 300 mg/kg, 7 days administration) on rats and mice, using experimental paradigms of anxiety and depression. In the open field, the aqueous extract increased significantly the number of center square crossed and the time spent at the center of the field as well as the rearing time, while the grooming time was reduced significantly. In the elevated plus maze, the aqueous extract increased the time spent and the number of entries in the open arms. All these effects were also completely reversed by flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors and pindolol a<jats:italic>β</jats:italic>-adrenoceptors blocker/5-HT 1A/1B receptor antagonist. The time spent in the light compartment, the latency time, and the number of the light-dark transitions increased significantly in the light/dark exploration test after the treatment with AM. The extract was able to reduce significantly the immobility time and increase swimming as well as climbing duration. Taken together, the present work evidenced anxiolytic effects of the aqueous extract of AM that might involve an action on benzodiazepine-type receptors and an antidepressant effect where noradrenergic mechanisms will probably play a role.</jats:p>",1

"Simultaneous liquid-chromatographic determination of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, catecholamines, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine in plasma, and their responses to inhibition of monoamine oxidase.","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>This is a reversed-phase liquid-chromatographic method, with electrochemical detection, for simultaneously measuring, in plasma, the concentrations of the catecholamine precursor dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA); the endogenous catecholamines norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine; and the deaminated catecholamine metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG). We used this method to assess effects of monoamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.4) inhibition in humans. Plasma DHPG concentrations as determined by the present method (mean 826, SEM 61 ng/L) were similar to those found by other methods. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase (by administering deprenyl or tranylcypromine) decreased plasma DHPG by greater than 65%, plasma DOPAC by greater than 50%, and plasma DOPA by about 20%, without consistently affecting norepinephrine or epinephrine. Simultaneous measurement of DOPA, catecholamines, and DHPG may be useful for examining the synthesis, release, and intraneuronal metabolism of norepinephrine. The assay method is rapid, reliable, and simple, and it provides a more comprehensive assessment of noradrenergic nervous function than does measurement only of catecholamines.</jats:p>",0

5-Methyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrobiopterin can modulate electrotonically mediated endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation,"<jats:p>

"Adult Neurogenesis, Mental Health, and Mental Illness: Hope or Hype?: Figure 1.","<jats:p>Psychiatric and neurologic disorders take an enormous toll on society. Alleviating the devastating symptoms and consequences of neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, depression, epilepsy, and schizophrenia is a main force driving clinical and basic researchers alike. By elucidating these disease neuromechanisms, researchers hope to better define treatments and preventive therapies. Research suggests that regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis represents a promising approach to treating and perhaps preventing mental illness. Here we appraise the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in major psychiatric and neurologic disorders within the essential framework of recent progress made in understanding “normal” adult neurogenesis. Topics addressed include the following: the life cycle of an adult hippocampal stem cell and the implications for aging; links between learning and hippocampal neurogenesis; the reciprocal relationship between cocaine self-administration and adult hippocampal neurogenesis; the role of adult neurogenesis in an animal model of depression and response to antidepressant exposure; the impact of neonatal seizures on dentate gyrus neurogenesis; and the contribution of a schizophrenia-susceptibility gene to adult hippocampal neurogenesis. These topics are discussed in light of the regulation of adult neurogenesis, the relationship to normal neurogenesis in adulthood and aging, and, importantly, the manipulation of neurogenesis to promote mental health and treat mental illness.</jats:p>",0

Protection by verapamil of mitochondrial glutathione equilibrium and phospholipid changes during reperfusion of ischemic canine myocardium.,"<jats:p>Pretreatment of the ischemic myocardium with verapamil protects against mitochondrial respiratory depression observed during ischemic arrest as well as during reperfusion. Since ischemic mitochondrial function appears not to be altered further by reperfusion, the purpose of this study is to identify a biochemical event affecting mitochondria that is specifically associated with reperfusion injury. It has been proposed that increased cellular Ca2+ influx and oxygen toxicity may result from reintroduction of coronary flow. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ is transmitted to the mitochondria with subsequent activation of Ca2+-dependent events, including phospholipase A2. Net production of lysophospholipids (and loss of total diacylphospholipids from the mitochondria) will proceed when reacylation mechanisms are inhibited. Since acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase is a sulfhydryl-sensitive enzyme and since increased activity of glutathione peroxidase shifts the levels of the mitochondrial sulfhydryl buffer, glutathione, towards oxidation, levels of glutathione and its oxidation state were measured during reperfusion in the absence or presence of verapamil pretreatment. Ischemia lowers total glutathione and reduces the redox ratio (reduced glutathione: oxidized glutathione) by 85%. Reperfusion partially returns the redox ratio to control by causing oxidized glutathione to disappear from the matrix. Verapamil maintains both the concentration and the redox potential of glutathione at control levels. Concomitant with alterations in reduced glutathione:oxidized glutathione is a decrease in ischemic mitochondrial phospholipid content. During reperfusion, phosphatidylethanolamine and its major constituent fatty acids (C 18:0 and C 20:4) are specifically lost from the mitochondrial membrane. Accompanying the significant loss of arachidonic acid during reperfusion is the decreased content of 11-OH, 12-OH, and 15-OH arachidonate. These lipid peroxidation products are not increased in ischemia. It is proposed that oxidation of matrix glutathione to glutathione disulfide during ischemia results in formation of glutathione-protein mixed disulfides and inhibition of sulfhydryl-sensitive proteins, including acyl-CoA lysophosphatide acyltransferase. Thus, metabolic events occurring within the ischemic period set the stage for prolonged dysfunction during reperfusion.</jats:p>",0

Acute Immobilization Stress and Intraventricular Injection of CRF Suppress Naloxone‐Induced LH Release in Ovariectomized Estrogen‐Primed Rats,"<jats:p>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role and possible interaction of the endogenous opioid peptide (EOP) and corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) in the acute stress‐induced suppression of gonadotropin secretion in ovariectomized estrogen‐primed rats. An intravenous (i.v.) injection of naloxone (10 or 20 mg/kg), an EOP antagonist, significantly elevated serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels within 10 min in non‐stressed animals. The naloxone‐induced LH release was completely eliminated when tested 30 min after the onset of acute immobilization. In a subsequent study, it was found that suppression of the naloxone‐induced LH release occurred as early as 5 min after the stress onset, and was still evident 60 min after the end of a 30‐min period of immobilization. The effect of naloxone was restored 3 h after liberation of the animal from the 30‐min immobilization. An intraventricular (i.c.v.) injection of CRF (1 or 5 μg) also significantly suppressed, in a dose‐related manner, the effect of a subsequent i.v. injection of naloxone. However, an i.c.v. injection of <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>‐helical CRF(9‐41) (25 or 50 μg), a CRF antagonist, prior to immobilization, could not interfere with the suppressive effect of stress on naloxone‐induced LH release. These results suggest that both acute immobilization stress and CRF can inhibit the LH secretory activity without mediation by EOP neurons. However, the stress‐related suppression may involve non‐CRF mechanism(s).</jats:p>",0

Endocannabinoid-Mediated Long-Term Depression of Afferent Excitatory Synapses in Hippocampal Pyramidal Cells and GABAergic Interneurons,"<jats:p>Although endocannabinoids have emerged as essential retrograde messengers in several forms of synaptic plasticity, it remains controversial whether they mediate long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic synapses onto excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus. Here, we show that parvalbumin- and somatostatin/metabotropic glutamate receptor 1<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>(mGlu<jats:sub>1a</jats:sub>)-positive GABAergic interneurons express diacylglycerol lipase-α (DGL-α), a synthesizing enzyme of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), albeit at lower levels than principal cells. Moreover, this lipase accumulates postsynaptically around afferent excitatory synapses in all three cell types. To address the role of retrograde 2-AG signaling in LTD, we investigated two forms: (1) produced by postsynaptic spiking paired with subsequent presynaptic stimulation or (2) induced by group I mGlu activation by (<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). Neither form of LTD was evoked in the presence of the mGlu<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>antagonist MPEP [2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine], the DGL inhibitor THL [<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-formyl-<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>-leucine (1<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>)-1-[[(2<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>,3<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>)-3-hexyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanyl]methyl]dodecyl ester], or the intracellularly applied Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>chelator BAPTA in CA1 pyramidal cells, fast-spiking interneurons (representing parvalbumin-containing cells) and interneurons projecting to stratum lacunosum-moleculare (representing somatostatin/mGlu<jats:sub>1a</jats:sub>-expressing interneurons). Both forms of LTD were completely absent in CB<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>cannabinoid receptor knock-out mice, whereas pharmacological blockade of CB<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>led to inconsistent results. Notably, in accordance with their lower DGL-α level, a higher stimulation frequency or higher DHPG concentration was required for LTD induction in interneurons compared with pyramidal cells. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal principal cells and interneurons produce endocannabinoids to mediate LTD in a qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different manner. The shifted induction threshold implies that endocannabinoid-LTD contributes to cortical information processing during distinct network activity patterns in a cell type-specific manner.</jats:p>",0

Sensory Responses during Sleep in Primate Primary and Secondary Auditory Cortex,"<jats:p>Most sensory stimuli do not reach conscious perception during sleep. It has been thought that the thalamus prevents the relay of sensory information to cortex during sleep, but the consequences for cortical responses to sensory signals in this physiological state remain unclear. We recorded from two auditory cortical areas downstream of the thalamus in naturally sleeping marmoset monkeys. Single neurons in primary auditory cortex either increased or decreased their responses during sleep compared with wakefulness. In lateral belt, a secondary auditory cortical area, the response modulation was also bidirectional and showed no clear systematic depressive effect of sleep. When averaged across neurons, sound-evoked activity in these two auditory cortical areas was surprisingly well preserved during sleep. Neural responses to acoustic stimulation were present during both slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep, were repeatedly observed over multiple sleep cycles, and demonstrated similar discharge patterns to the responses recorded during wakefulness in the same neuron. Our results suggest that the thalamus is not as effective a gate for the flow of sensory information as previously thought. At the cortical stage, a novel pattern of activation/deactivation appears across neurons. Because the neural signal reaches as far as secondary auditory cortex, this leaves open the possibility of altered sensory processing of auditory information during sleep.</jats:p>",0
mGluR2 acts through inhibitory Gα subunits to regulate transmission and long-term plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapses,"<jats:p>
            Presynaptic inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors play a critical role in regulating transmission at a number of synapses in the central and peripheral nervous system. We generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active form of an inhibitory Gα subunit to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of one such receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 2, at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus. mGluR2 participates in at least three types of mossy fiber synaptic plasticity, (
            <jats:italic>i</jats:italic>
            ) transient suppression of synaptic transmission, (
            <jats:italic>ii</jats:italic>
            ) long-term depression (LTD), and (
            <jats:italic>iii</jats:italic>
            ) inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP), and we find that inhibitory Gα signaling is sufficient to account for the actions of mGluR2 in each. The fact that constitutively active Gα
            <jats:sub>i2</jats:sub>
            occludes the transient suppression of synaptic transmission by mGluR2, while enhancing LTD, suggests further that these two forms of plasticity are expressed via different mechanisms. In addition, the LTP deficit observed in constitutively active Gα
            <jats:sub>i2</jats:sub>
            -expressing mice suggests that mGluR2 activation may serve as a metaplastic switch to permit the induction of LTD by inhibiting LTP.

Body weight decreased exponentially, while metabolic rate dropped 45% from an average of 2.95 ± 0.15 (SEM) W kg<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> at day 2 of fasting to a stable level of 1.62 ± 0.06 (SEM) W kg<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> from day 10 to day 47 of fasting. Respiratory quotient was low, indicating extensive catabolism of triglycerides, while plasma cortisol was fairly stable at 110 ± 8 (SEM) nmol 1<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> throughout the fasting period. Daily urinary output decreased from 236 ± 20 (SEM) ml day<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> at day 2 to a stable value of 87 ± 6 (SEM) ml day<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> between days 8 and 50 of fasting. The urine was analysed for urea, uric acid, creatinine, ammonia, total nitrogen and osmolality. Urea was always the principal excretory end‐product, amounting to between 70 and 80% of the total excreted nitrogen. The urine was moderately concentrated (range 770–1300 mosmol kg<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>). Total excreted urinary nitrogen decreased by 68% from 3.7±0.7 (SEM) g day<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> to 1.2 ± 0.4(SEM) g day<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> between days 2 and 50. The urinary nitrogen was used to calculate the daily amount of protein being oxidized and its energy content was compared with the measured basal metabolic rate of individual animals. Approximately 6% of the energy expended by grey seal pups during the post‐weaning fast is derived from oxidation of protein. It is concluded that a rapid depression of basal metabolic rate and extensive blubber catabolism enable grey seal pups to endure prolonged periods of fasting without any apparent signs of discomfort or stress.</jats:p>",0

Corticostriatal synaptic function in mouse models of Huntington's disease: early effects of huntingtin repeat length and protein load,"<jats:p>Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, late onset, neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor deficits and dementia that is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the HD gene. Clinical manifestations result from selective neuronal degeneration of predominantly GABAergic striatal medium‐sized spiny neurons (MSNs). A growing number of studies demonstrate that personality, mood and cognitive disturbances are some of the earliest signs of HD and may reflect synaptic dysfunction prior to neuronal loss. Previous studies in striatal MSNs demonstrated early alterations in NMDA‐type glutamate receptor currents in several HD mouse models, as well as evidence for presynaptic dysfunction prior to disease manifestations in the R6/2 HD fragment mouse model. We have compared corticostriatal synaptic function in full‐length, human HD gene‐carrying YAC transgenic mice expressing a non‐pathogenic CAG repeat (YAC18; control) with three increasingly severe variants of pathogenic HD gene‐expressing mice (YAC72 and two different lines of YAC128), at ages that precede any detectable disease phenotype. We report presynaptic dysfunction and a propensity towards synaptic depression in YAC72 and YAC128 compared to YAC18 mice, and, in the most severe model, we also observed altered AMPA receptor function. When normalized to evoked AMPAR currents, postsynaptic NMDAR currents are augmented in all three pathogenic HD YAC variants. These findings demonstrate multiple perturbations to corticostriatal synaptic function in HD mice, furthering our understanding of the early effects of the HD mutation that may contribute to cognitive dysfunction, mood disorders and later development of more serious dysfunction. Furthermore, this study provides a set of neurophysiological sequelae against which to test and compare other mouse models and potential therapies in HD.</jats:p>",0

Relationship between dopamine deficit and the expression of depressive behavior resulted from alteration of serotonin system,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Depression frequently accompanies in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous research suggested that dopamine (DA) and serotonin systems are closely linked with depression in PD. However, comprehensive studies about the relationship between these two neurotransmitter systems are limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of dopaminergic destruction on the serotonin system. The interconnection between motor and depression was also examined. Two PET scans were performed in the 6‐hydroxydopamine (6‐OHDA) lesioned and sham operated rats: [<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>F]FP‐CIT for DA transporters and [<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>F]Mefway for serotonin 1A (5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>) receptors. Here, 6‐OHDA is a neurotoxin for dopaminergic neurons. Behavioral tests were used to evaluate the severity of symptoms: rotational number for motor impairment and immobility time, acquired from the forced swim test for depression. Region‐of‐interests were drawn in the striatum and cerebellum for the DA system and hippocampus and cerebellum for the 5‐HT system. The cerebellum was chosen as a reference region. Nondisplaceable binding potential in the striatum and hippocampus were compared between 6‐OHDA and sham groups. As a result, the degree of DA depletion was negatively correlated with rotational behavior (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.79, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.003). In 6‐OHDA lesioned rats, binding values for 5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub> receptors was 22% lower than the sham operated group. This decrement of 5‐HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub> receptor binding was also correlated with the severity of depression (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.81, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.006). Taken together, this research demonstrated that the destruction of dopaminergic system causes the reduction of the serotonergic system resulting in the expression of depressive behavior. The degree of dopaminergic dysfunction was positively correlated with the impairment of the serotonin system. Severity of motor symptoms was also closely related to depressive behavior. <jats:bold>Synapse 69:453–460, 2015.</jats:bold> © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",1

Change in bi‐directional plasticity at CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices taken from 6‐hydroxydopamine‐treated rats: the role of endogenous norepinephrine,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The object of the present study is to investigate the role of endogenous adrenergic innervation in regulating bi‐directional synaptic plasticity in rat hippocampal CA1 synapses. The endogenous adrenergic system was eliminated by giving subcutaneous injection of 6‐hydroxydopamine (6‐OHDA) to rats immediately after birth, and the animals were killed for experiments at postnatal ages of 25–35 days. In hippocampal slices taken from 6‐OHDA‐treated animals, theta‐burst stimulation at 100 Hz failed to induce long‐term potentiation (LTP) at CA1 synapses. However, the induction of long‐term depression (LTD) by prolonged low frequency stimulation at 1 Hz was unaffected in slices from 6‐OHDA‐treated animals. Bath application of norepinephrine (NE) restored LTP to control levels and blocked LTD. This effect was mimicked by β‐ but not α‐adrenergic receptor agonists, i.e. by isoproterenol but not phenylephrine. The activators of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A (PKA), i.e. forskolin and 8‐bromoadenosine‐3′, 5′‐cyclic monophosphate, respectively, restored LTP in slices from 6‐OHDA‐treated animals. In addition, application of the D1/D5 receptor agonist, dihydrexidine, also restored LTP in slices from 6‐OHDA‐treated animals. These results suggest that physiologically the recruitment of catecholamine innervation may be important for induction of LTP at hippocampal CA1 synapses during tetanic stimulation, while it may not be essential for LTD induction by prolonged 1 Hz stimulation. The released NE and dopamine exert their role in modulating synaptic plasticity via activation of β‐adrenergic and D1/D5 receptors, respectively, which in turn increase the levels of cytoplasm adenosine‐3′,5′‐cyclic monophosphate and PKA.</jats:p>",0

Growth of Fusarium moniliforme on carob aqueous extract and nutritional evaluation of its biomass,"<jats:p>Fusarium moniliforme was cultured semicontinuously on a carob medium in a 14-liter fermentor (8.5-liter working volume). The growth medium provided 2.4% carob sugar, 0.72% NH4H2PO4, and 0.03% MgSO4-7H2O. The biomass harvest was 8.8 g/liter per day. Ninety percent of the sugars were consumed, and the pH dropped from 5.9 to about 3.7. The crude protein (N X 6.25) of the spray-dried mycelium was 380 g/kg, 300 g/kg for the true protein (Lowry), and 4.8 g/kg for the (Folin-Denis) tannic acid. The mycelium was evaluated nutritionally with the weanling rat as experimental animal. The protein efficiency ratio and net protein utilization values for the unsupplemented mycelium were 1.15 and 0.42, respectively, and for the mycelium supplemented with DL-methionine (5 g/kg) they were 2.31 and 0.72, respectively. No growth depression was observed in the experimental rats, and on dissection of the carcasses the internal organs were found to be normal.</jats:p>",0

Normal motor learning during pharmacological prevention of Purkinje cell long-term depression,"<jats:p>
            Systemic delivery of (1R-1-benzo thiophen-5-yl-2[2-diethylamino)-ethoxy] ethanol hydrochloride (T-588) prevented long-term depression (LTD) of the parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapse induced by conjunctive climbing fiber and PF stimulation
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            . However, similar concentrations of T-588 in the brains of behaving mice and rats affected neither motor learning in the rotorod test nor the learning of motor timing during classical conditioning of the eyeblink reflex. Rats given doses of T-588 that prevented PF-PC LTD were as proficient as controls in learning to adapt the timing of their conditioned eyeblink response to a 150- or 350-ms change in the timing of the paradigm. The experiment indicates that PF-PC LTD under control of the climbing fibers is not required for general motor adaptation or the learning of response timing in two common models of motor learning for which the cerebellum has been implicated. Alternative mechanisms for motor timing and possible functions for LTD in protection from excitotoxicity are discussed.

"Calcium absorption in diphosphonate‐treated rats: effect of parathyroid function, dietary calcium and phosphorus.","<jats:p>1. The role of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1, 25‐dihydroxy‐cholecalciferol (1,25‐(OH)2D3) in modulation of intestinal Ca absorption was studied in rats, using disodium ethane‐1‐hydroxy‐1,1‐diphosphonate (EHDP), which is known to reduce 1,25‐(OH)2D3 formation. 2. EHDP decreased intestinal Ca absorption. This effect could be abolished by small amounts of 1,25‐(OH)2D3, whereas even large doses of PTH were ineffective. EHDP also decreased Ca absorption in thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats. Therefore the effect of EHDP on 1,25‐(OH)2D3 production is unlikely to be mediated through PTH. 3. The correction by PTH of the decreased Ca absorption in TPTX rats was inhibited by EHDP. Since EHDP inhibits formation of 1,25‐(OH)2D3 the effect of PTH on Ca absorption is likely to be mediated through this vitamin D3 metabolite. 4. In normal rats both a low Ca and a low P diet stimulated Ca absorption. In EHDP‐treated intact rats low Ca still stimulated Ca absorption, whereas the effect of low P abolished. This indicates that low Ca and low P diets affect Ca absorption through different mechanisms. 5. Intestinal adaptation to a low Ca diet was still observed in EHDP‐treated TPTX rats. Thus, in the rat, intestinal adaptation to low Ca diet can occur without PTH.</jats:p>",0

            1. Electrophysiological and electron-microscopic studies were made of the effect of lan­thanum ions on frog neuromuscular junctions. 2. In the presence of 1 mM La
            <jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>
            , nerve impulses continued to invade the nerve terminals but ceased to release transmitter. 3. Lanthanum caused a rapid and large increase in the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials; presumably because La activates the mechanism of transmitter release without the usual prerequisite of presynaptic membrane depolarization. At 4 °C, La caused a 10000-fold, or even larger increase in the rate of leakage of transmitter quanta. Such high rate of trans­mitter release was not accompanied by obvious changes in electron-microscopic structure of the nerve terminals. 4. With continued La-treatment, the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials subsides slowly until they are no longer detectable at most end-plates. During this period the number of synaptic vesicles is reduced until practically all the endings become completely depleted of synaptic vesicles. In contrast, coated vesicles and membrane-bound tubes and cysternae become more numerous.

The interaction between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic potentials in neurones lying in the submucous plexus of guinea‐pig ileum has been examined. 2. It was found that during an inhibitory conductance change, electrotonic potentials were more depressed in amplitude than were excitatory synaptic potentials. 3. It is suggested that inhibitory conductance changes may have only a slight effect on the impedance seen by excitatory synaptic currents as much of the excitatory synaptic current flow is likely to be capacitive. 4. A part of the depression of excitatory synaptic potential amplitude was not associated with changes in electrical properties of neurones and it is suggested that inhibitory transmitter may reduce the release of excitatory transmitter.</jats:p>",0

PPARγ Agonist Improves Neuronal Insulin Receptor Function in Hippocampus and Brain Mitochondria Function in Rats with Insulin Resistance Induced by Long Term High-Fat Diets,"<jats:p>We previously demonstrated that a high-fat diet (HFD) consumption can cause not only peripheral insulin resistance, but also neuronal insulin resistance. Moreover, the consumption of an HFD has been shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in both the skeletal muscle and liver. Rosiglitazone, a peroxizome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ligand, is a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent studies suggested that rosiglitazone can improve learning and memory in both human and animal models. However, the effects of rosiglitazone on neuronal insulin resistance and brain mitochondria after the HFD consumption have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that rosiglitazone improves neuronal insulin resistance caused by a HFD via attenuating the dysfunction of neuronal insulin receptors and brain mitochondria. Rosiglitazone (5 mg/kg · d) was given for 14 d to rats that were fed with either a HFD or normal diet for 12 wk. After the 14th week, all animals were euthanized, and their brains were removed and examined for insulin-induced long-term depression, neuronal insulin signaling, and brain mitochondrial function. We found that rosiglitazone significantly improved peripheral insulin resistance and insulin-induced long-term depression and increased neuronal Akt/PKB-ser phosphorylation in response to insulin. Furthermore, rosiglitazone prevented brain mitochondrial conformational changes and attenuated brain mitochondrial swelling, brain mitochondrial membrane potential changes, and brain mitochondrial ROS production. Our data suggest that neuronal insulin resistance and the impairment of brain mitochondria caused by a 12-wk HFD consumption can be reversed by rosiglitazone.</jats:p>",0

Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors Are Involved in Long-Term Potentiation in Isolated Slices of Rat Medial Frontal Cortex,"<jats:p> Vickery, R. M., Shanida H. Morris, and Lynn J. Bindman. Metabotropic glutamate receptors are involved in long-term potentiation in isolated slices of rat medial frontal cortex. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 3039–3046, 1997. The prelimbic region of medial frontal cortex in the rat receives a direct input from the hippocampus and this functional connection is essential for aspects of spatial memory. Activity-dependent changes in the effectiveness of synaptic transmission in the medial frontal cortex, namely long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) can persist for tens of minutes or hours and may be the basis of learning and memory storage. Glutamatergic activation of ionotropic receptors is required to induce both LTP and LTD. We now present evidence of the involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptors in LTP in isolated slices of frontal cortex. Repetitive bursts of stimulation at theta frequencies (TBS) were applied to layer II, and monosynaptic EPSPs were monitored in layer V neurons of the prelimbic area. TBS was found to be more effective at inducing LTP than tetanic stimulation at 100 Hz and produced LTP that lasted &gt;30 min in 8 out of 14 neurons. Tetanic stimulation at 100 Hz in the presence of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5) was reported to be a reliable method of inducing LTD in prelimbic cortex ( Hirsch and Crépel 1991 ). However we found that this protocol did not facilitate the induction of LTD. The role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) in LTP was assessed by using the selective, broad-spectrum antagonist (R, S)-α-methyl-4- carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG). This drug significantly reduced the incidence of LTP after TBS to only 1 of 14 neurons ( P &lt; 0.02, χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> test). The pooled responses to TBS in MCPG showed significantly reduced potentiation [( P &lt; 0.02, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. The broad-spectrum mGluR agonist (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) and the selective group I agonist S-3 hydroxyphenylglycine(S-3HPG) both produced membrane depolarization, an increase in number of spikes evoked by depolarizing current pulses, and a reduction in the afterhyperpolarization. Similar effects were produced by these agonists even when synaptic transmission was blocked by use of the γ-aminobutyric acid-B (GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>) receptor agonist, 200 μM baclofen, which suggests that group I mGluRs are present on layer V neurons. We conclude that mGluRs participate in the production of LTP in prelimbic cortex, and that this excitatory effect could be mediated by the postsynaptic group I mGluRs. </jats:p>",0
"ATTACHMENT, LOSS, AND DEPRESSION<sup>*</sup>","<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The influence of 10 days of maternal separation on behavior and physiology was studied in 8 social group living pigtailed macaque (<jats:italic>M. nemestrina</jats:italic>)monkey infants. Maternal separation was accompanied by behavioral changes' included slowing of movement, decreases in play, increases in oral behaviors, and assumption of a characteristic slouched posture and sad facial expression. Physiological changes included decreases in heart rate and body temperature, sleep disturbances that were most pronounced in the Awake and REM sleep systems, and changes in EEG alpha power‐spectra. Individual variability in the behavioral and physiological response to maternal separation was marked, and showed only a minimal correlation with measures of early behavioral development and the early mother‐infant interaction. Some physiological changes appeared to lie relatively long lasting. The data demonstrate that the disruption of an attachment bond may be accompanied by pronounced physiological changes suggestive of d general impairment of autonomic homeostatic regulatory processes. The findings have important implications for our understanding of the Pathophysiology of grief, and the physiological concomitants of. separation, loss, and depression in children.</jats:p>",1

"Respiratory peripheral chemosensory irritation, acute and repeated exposure toxicity studies with aerosols of triethylene glycol","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The potential for adverse effects from exposure to respirable aerosols of triethylene glycol (TEG: CAS Number 112‐27‐6) was investigated by a peripheral chemosensory irritation study, and by acute and repeated exposure toxicity studies. The sensory irritation study, conducted with male Swiss Webster mice, showed an exposure concentration‐related depression of breathing rate that allowed the calculation of an RD<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> of 5140 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>. In an acute study male and female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed whole body to aerosols of TEG up to 6730 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> for 4 h. No mortalities occurred at this high concentration, but unexplained mortality occurred in female rats at 5230 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> at 2–3 days postexposure. Two repeats of the 5230 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> exposure did not cause mortality. Signs at 6730 and 5230 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> were limited to those of irritancy. For a 9 day repeated exposure study rats were exposed whole body to 0, 494, 2011 and 4824 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> TEG aerosols for 6 h day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Mortalities occurred at 4824 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> between exposure days 2 and 5. Nonspecific indications of toxicity at 2011 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> were signs of irritation, decreased body weight and increased food and water consumption; evidence of hepatic dysfunction was indicated by increased serum alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities, but liver histology was normal. Fluid imbalance was suggested by increases in water consumption, blood urea nitrogen, relative kidney weight and urine volume, with decreased urine osmolality, pH and <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>‐acetyl‐<jats:italic>β</jats:italic>‐<jats:sc>D</jats:sc>‐glucosaminidase activity. At 494 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> there were minimal signs of irritation, increased water consumption and slightly increased alkaline phosphatase; histology of the kidney was normal. Thus, in this 9 day repeated aerosol whole body exposure study a No‐Observed‐Effect‐Level (NOEL) could not be established. Since preening of the fur at these high aerosol concentrations exposures might have led to a confounding factor from the resultant oral intake, another 9 day repeated aerosol study was conducted, but by nose‐only exposure of rats for 6 h day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> to TEG aerosol concentrations of 0, 102, 517 and 1036 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>. In this study there were no clinical signs, no effects on food and water consumption, and no biochemical or histological evidence of hepatorenal dysfunction. By the end of the exposure period, male and female rats of the 1036 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> group had body weights lower than those of the controls, but not with statistical significance. Since there were no statistically significant effects on any monitors, 1036 mg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> is considered to be a threshold for toxicity by nose‐only exposure to TEG aerosol. The findings indicate that exposure to a respirable aerosol is not acutely harmful, but may cause sensory irritant effects. Repeated exposure to high concentrations of TEG aerosols may be harmful, particularly if there are contributions from additional routes of exposure.

Osmotic Edema Rapidly Increases Neuronal Excitability Through Activation of NMDA Receptor-Dependent Slow Inward Currents in Juvenile and Adult Hippocampus,"<jats:p> Cellular edema (cell swelling) is a principal component of numerous brain disorders including ischemia, cortical spreading depression, hyponatremia, and epilepsy. Cellular edema increases seizure-like activity in vitro and in vivo, largely through nonsynaptic mechanisms attributable to reduction of the extracellular space. However, the types of excitability changes occurring in individual neurons during the acute phase of cell volume increase remain unclear. Using whole-cell patch clamp techniques, we report that one of the first effects of osmotic edema on excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells is the generation of slow inward currents (SICs), which initiate after approximately 1 min. Frequency of SICs increased as osmolarity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Imaging of real-time volume changes in astrocytes revealed that neuronal SICs occurred while astrocytes were still in the process of swelling. SICs evoked by cell swelling were mainly nonsynaptic in origin and NMDA receptor-dependent. To better understand the relationship between SICs and changes in neuronal excitability, recordings were performed in increasingly physiological conditions. In the absence of any added pharmacological reagents or imposed voltage clamp, osmotic edema induced excitatory postsynaptic potentials and burst firing over the same timecourse as SICs. Like SICs, action potentials were blocked by NMDAR antagonists. Effects were more pronounced in adult (8–20 weeks old) compared with juvenile (P15–P21) mice. Together, our results indicate that cell swelling triggered by reduced osmolarity rapidly increases neuronal excitability through activation of NMDA receptors. Our findings have important implications for understanding nonsynaptic mechanisms of epilepsy in relation to cell swelling and reduction of the extracellular space. </jats:p>",0

The level of activity of the three gastric functions, emptying, acid secretion and pepsinogen secretion appears to be linked. A single stimulus, therefore, could evoke a duodenal receptor or receptors to mediate or suppress activity of the gastric smooth muscle and secretory cells through interrelated mechanisms. The effect of some duodenal infusates, however, produces some variability in response which suggests differential activation of different receptors with consequent variable motor activity on effector cells.</jats:p>",0

Description of a model to simulate effects of <i>Eimeria acervulina</i> infection on broiler production,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>A simulation model for effects of <jats:italic>Eimeria acervulina</jats:italic> infection on technical and economic characteristics in broiler production is presented. The model describes development over time of the growth depression, feed intake reduction, and decrease in feed efficiency associated with infection. The model also shows a phase of compensatory growth during which earlier negative effects are counterbalanced, at least partly. Major assumptions made were: infection with <jats:italic>E. acervulina</jats:italic> occurs in each flock; production is affected in each flock; compensatory growth takes place because immunity develops and cell regeneration occurs. The results show that the pattern of development of the production characteristics during a flock cycle depends on the initial contamination level. Both a high and low initial contamination level results in a lower average daily gain, a worse feed to gain ratio, and a reduced net revenue compared to an intermediate contamination level.</jats:p>",0

Activation Conditions for the Induction of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent Long-Term Depression in Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Cells,"<jats:p>Two forms of homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) are distinguished in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, one which is NMDA receptor dependent and the other metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) dependent. Although the molecular processes involved in mGluR-LTD are well characterized, the conditions of circuit activation required for its induction remain unclear. We show that mGluR-LTD cannot be induced in synaptically coupled CA3–CA1 pyramidal cell pairs. Experiments to address the underlying mechanisms indicate that, even when glutamate transporters are blocked, one presynaptic cell releases insufficient glutamate to evoke an mGluR-mediated current in a connected CA1 cell. These findings imply that extrasynaptic diffusion is not a limiting factor and are consistent with a sparse distribution of functional mGluRs in the dendritic tree of pyramidal cells. Thus, the discharge of multiple Schaffer collaterals to a targeted cell is necessary for mGluR-LTD. Our experiments indicate that approximately eight CA3 inputs to a CA1 pyramidal cell must be activated to induce mGluR-LTD.</jats:p>",0

Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia Depresses Afferent Neurotransmission in NTS Neurons by a Reduction in the Number of Active Synapses,"<jats:p>Long-term synaptic plasticity has been recently described in brainstem areas associated to visceral afferent sensory integration. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), an animal model for studying obstructive sleep apnea in humans, depresses the afferent neurotransmission in nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) neurons, which affect respiratory and autonomic regulation. Here we identified the synaptic mechanisms of CIH-induced depression of the afferent neurotransmission in NTS neurons in juvenile rats. We verified that CIH reduced the amplitude of both NMDA and non-NMDA glutamatergic excitatory currents (eEPSCs) evoked by tractus solitarii stimulation (TS-eEPSC) of second-order neurons in the NTS. No changes were observed in release probability, evidenced by absence of any CIH-elicited effects on short-term depression and failures in EPSCs evoked in low calcium. CIH also produced no changes in TS-eEPSC quantal size, since the amplitudes of both low calcium-evoked EPSCs and asynchronous TS-eEPSCs (evoked in the presence of Sr<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>) were unchanged. Using single TS afferent fiber stimulation in slices from control and CIH rats we clearly show that CIH reduced the quantal content of the TS-eEPSCs without affecting the quantal size or release probability, suggesting a reduction in the number of active synapses as the mechanism of CIH induced TS-eEPSC depression. In accordance with this concept, the input–output relationship of stimulus intensity and TS-eEPSC amplitude shows an early saturation in CIH animals. These findings open new perspectives for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the synaptic plasticity in the brainstem sensory neurons under challenges such as those produced by CIH in experimental and pathological conditions.</jats:p>",0

PSD-95 uncoupling from NMDA receptors by Tat-<i>N</i>-dimer ameliorates neuronal depolarization in cortical spreading depression,"<jats:p> Cortical spreading depression is associated with activation of NMDA receptors, which interact with the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) that binds to nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Here, we tested whether inhibition of the nNOS/PSD-95/NMDA receptor complex formation by anti-ischemic compound, UCCB01-144 (Tat- N-dimer) ameliorates the persistent effects of cortical spreading depression on cortical function. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy in somatosensory cortex in mice, we show that fluorescently labelled Tat- N-dimer readily crosses blood-brain barrier and accumulates in nerve cells during the first hour after i.v. injection. The Tat- N-dimer suppressed stimulation-evoked synaptic activity by 2–20%, while cortical blood flow and cerebral oxygen metabolic (CMRO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) responses were preserved. During cortical spreading depression, the Tat- N-dimer reduced the average amplitude of the negative shift in direct current potential by 33% (4.1 mV). Furthermore, the compound diminished the average depression of spontaneous electrocorticographic activity by 11% during first 40 min of post-cortical spreading depression recovery, but did not mitigate the suppressing effect of cortical spreading depression on cortical blood flow and CMRO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. We suggest that uncoupling of PSD-95 from NMDA receptors reduces overall neuronal excitability and the amplitude of the spreading depolarization wave. These findings may be of interest for understanding the neuroprotective effects of the nNOS/PSD-95 uncoupling in stroke. </jats:p>",0
A Pertussis Toxin-Sensitive 8-Lipoxygenase Pathway Is Activated by a Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor in<i>Aplysia</i>Neurons,"<jats:p>Acetylcholine (ACh) activates two types of chloride conductances in Aplysia neurons that can be distinguished by their kinetics and pharmacology. One is a rapidly desensitizing current that is blocked by α-conotoxin-ImI and the other is a sustained current that is insensitive to the toxin. These currents are differentially expressed in Aplysia neurons. We report here that neurons that respond to ACh with a sustained chloride conductance also generate 8-lipoxygenase metabolites. The sustained chloride conductance and the activation of 8-lipoxygenase have similar pharmacological profiles. Both are stimulated by suberyldicholine and nicotine, and both are inhibited by α-bungarotoxin. Like the sustained chloride conductance, the activation of 8-lipoxygenase is not blocked by α-conotoxin-ImI. In spite of the similarities between the metabolic and electrophysiological responses, the generation of 8-lipoxygenase metabolites does not appear to depend on the ion current since an influx of chloride ions is neither necessary nor sufficient for the formation of the lipid metabolites. In addition, the application of pertussis toxin blocked the ACh-activated release of arachidonic acid and the subsequent production of 8-lipoxygenase metabolites, yet the ACh-induced activation of the chloride conductance is not dependent on a G protein. Our results are consistent with the idea that the nicotinic ACh receptor that activates the sustained chloride conductance can, independent of the chloride ion influx, initiate lipid messenger synthesis.</jats:p>",0

The chickens demonstrated anorexia, depression, and 100% mortality within 2 days postinoculation. Three of the pigeons died after a history of depression and severe neurological signs consisting of paresis to paralysis, mild enteric hemorrhage, resulting in a mortality of 21%. Gross lesions in these pigeons were mild and inconsistent. Occasionally subcutaneous hyperemia and hemorrhage and cerebral malacia were observed. Microscopic lesions and detection of viral antigen were confined to the central nervous system of these pigeons. In the cerebrum and to a minor extent in the brain stem a lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis with disseminated neuronal and glial cell necrosis, perivascular cuffing, glial nodules, and in one bird focally extensive liquefactive necrosis could be observed. The remaining nine pigeons showed neither clinical signs nor gross or histological lesions associated with avian influenza, although seroconversion against H5 indicated that they had been infected. These results confirm that pigeons are susceptible to HPAIV A/chicken/Indonesia/2003 (H5N1) and that the disease is associated with the neurotropism of this virus. Although sentinel chickens and most pigeons did not develop disease, further experiments have to elucidate whether or not Columbiformes are involved in transmission and spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza. </jats:p>",0

A neuronal substrate for a state‐dependent modulation of sensory inputs in the brainstem,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Central networks modulate sensory transmission during motor behavior. Sensory inputs may thus have distinct impacts according to the state of activity of the central networks. Using an <jats:italic>in‐vitro</jats:italic> isolated lamprey brainstem preparation, we investigated whether a brainstem locomotor center, the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), modulates sensory transmission. The synaptic responses of brainstem reticulospinal (RS) cells to electrical stimulation of the sensory trigeminal nerve were recorded before and after electrical stimulation of the MLR. The RS cell synaptic responses were significantly reduced by MLR stimulation and the reduction of the response increased with the stimulation intensity of the MLR. Bath perfusion of atropine prevented the depression of sensory transmission, indicating that muscarinic receptor activation is involved. Previous studies have shown that, upon stimulation of the MLR, behavioral activity switches from a resting state to an active‐locomotor state. Therefore, our results suggest that a state‐dependent modulation of sensory transmission to RS cells occurs in the behavioral context of locomotion and that muscarinic inputs from the MLR are involved.</jats:p>",0

"ARGON, XENON, HYDROGEN, AND THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AND GLYCOLYSIS OF MOUSE TISSUE SLICES","<jats:p>The effects of xenon, argon, and hydrogen on the aerobic and anaerobic metabolism of mouse liver, brain, and sarcoma slices have been investigated. Xenon was found to alter the rates of metabolism of these tissues in a manner almost identical with helium.

Effect of Soy Diets and Equol on Female Depressive Behaviors and Body Weight in Long‐Evans Rats,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>In five different studies we examined the effect of soy‐containing diets and equol injections on depression, serotonin levels, weight gain and white adipose tissue (WAT) deposition of female Long‐Evans rats in various stages of life. In these experiments the rats were intact, ovariectomized or experienced natural ovarian failure (NOF). The results of all the experiments will be presented, but experiment 5 is covered here due to space limitations. From conception the female rats were exposed to either: a) a soy‐rich (Phyto‐600) or b) low‐soy diet (Phyto‐low). After approximately 290 days all the rats experienced NOF. At 330 days‐old the animals were examined in the Porsolt forced swim test (PFST). One month later the animals were again tested in the PFST [after the animals fed the Phyto‐low diet were injected with equol (@ 5 mg/kg/day) for one week]. At the first PFST, serotonin levels and mobility were decreased in the Phyto‐low fed animals compared to the Phyto‐600 animals. After the equol injections the differences in the measured parameters by treatment disappeared. Equol increased mobility in aged‐female rats that had undergone NOF and increased serotonin levels comparable to Phyto‐600 fed animals. In all the studies, animals fed a soy‐rich diet decreased body weight and adipose tissue deposition vs. a low‐soy diet. (Grant Support: USDA 2004‐01811)</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Dopamine enhancement and depression of glutamate-regulated calcium and electrical activity in hypothalamic neurons,"<jats:p> 1. The neurotransmitter dopamine is found throughout the hypothalamus both in cell bodies and in axons originating from intra- and extrahypothalamic sources. To study the mechanisms of action of dopamine on cultured rat hypothalamic neurons, particularly in relation to Ca2+ regulation, we used Ca2+ digital imaging with fura-2 and whole cell patch-clamp recording. We focused on the modulatory actions of dopamine on glutamate. 2. Dopamine administration had little or no independent effect on intracellular Ca2+. However, in the presence of tetrodotoxin to block action potentials and action-potential-dependent transmitter release, dopamine (10 microM for 2-3 min) caused an increase in glutamate-evoked Ca2+ rises in 22% of 64 neurons and depressed glutamate-evoked Ca2+ rises in an equal number of neurons. Shorter exposure to dopamine reduced the number of responding cells. 3. Dopamine application to neurons with an elevated Ca2+ due to synaptic release of glutamate (in the absence of tetrodotoxin) generally caused a decrease in Ca2+ levels (40% of 106 neurons), but sometimes increased cytosolic Ca2+ (10% of 106 neurons). That dopamine influenced cells differently in conditions of spontaneous activity compared with evoked activity may be due to dopamine effects on presynaptic receptors detected under conditions of ongoing synaptic release of glutamate. 4. Dopamine modulation of glutamate responses was detected at early stages of neuronal development (embryonic day 18 after 2 days in vitro) and also after 60 days in vitro. 5. The D1, D2, and D3 dopamine receptor agonists SKF38393, quinpirole, and 7-OH-DPAT (+/- 7 hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin) caused a reduction in Ca2+ levels raised by endogenous glutamate release or evoked by exogenous glutamate application. 6. To block the actions of dopamine released by hypothalamic neurons, D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists were used. As with dopamine, dopamine antagonists had no effect on intracellular Ca2+ during glutamate receptor blockade. In the absence of glutamate receptor block, the D1 antagonist SCH23390 (1 microM) reduced Ca2+ in responding cells; in contrast, the D2 antagonist eticlopride (1 microM) generated a delayed increase in Ca2+ levels. 7. Dopamine is known to activate second messengers through G proteins independent of changes in membrane potential or input resistance. Whole cell recording was used to demonstrate that, parallel to the modulation of Ca2+, dopamine exerted a dramatic change in glutamate-mediated electrical activity, generally depressing activity and hyperpolarizing the membrane potential (8 of 15 neurons). In a smaller number of neurons (5 of 15), dopamine enhanced glutamate-mediated excitatory activity. 8. Dopamine-evoked changes in membrane potential were in part mediated through modulation of glutamate actions. Dopamine depressed glutamate-evoked currents in a dose-dependent fashion, with Hill slopes in individual neurons ranging from 0.3 to 0.6. Dopamine could also evoke a direct hyperpolarizing action on hypothalamic neurons in the presence of tetrodotoxin or glutamate receptor blockers, at least in part by opening K+ channels. 9. Glutamate plays an important role as a primary excitatory transmitter within the hypothalamus. Our data support the hypothesis that a major mechanism of dopamine's influence on hypothalamic neurons involves the modulation of glutamate's excitatory action, mostly by inhibition. This is consistent with the hypothesis that modulation of glutamate activity may be an important mechanism of dopamine action throughout the nervous system. </jats:p>",0

Women had significantly higher values of the GDS compared to men ( versus , ). Participants in the upper tertile of depression scale ate less frequent fish and consumed higher quantities of alcohol, compared to those in the lowest tertile (all ). Regarding fish consumption, 50% of the individuals reported consuming 1-2 times weekly, 32% 3 to 5 times weekly, 11% 2-3 times monthly, while the rest reported rare (4.5%) and everyday (1.2%) consumption. Logistic regression showed that increased fish consumption (&gt;3 times/week versus never/rare) was inversely associated with the odds of having GDS greater the median value (i.e., 4) (, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.61), after controlling for several cofounders.<jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>.

Perivascular nerves contribute to cortical spreading  depression-associated hyperemia in rats,"<jats:p> We investigated the contribution of perivascular nerves and neurotransmitters to cortical spreading depression (CSD)-associated hyperperfusion in the rat. Chronic transection of the nasociliary nerve (NCN, 2 wk before) decreased ipsilateral CSD-associated hyperperfusion by 23 ± 13% (mean ± SD; n = 5, P &lt; 0.05), whereas acute transection of the NCN or sham surgery had no effect ( n = 8). When the NCN and parasympathetic nerve fibers (PSN) were both chronically transected, CSD hyperperfusion was attenuated by 55 ± 19% ( n = 5, P &lt; 0.05). Cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia was not significantly affected. Brain topical superfusion of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> M) caused a reduction of CSD hyperperfusion by 41 ± 13% ( n = 5, P &lt; 0.05). The competitive blockade of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors by CGRP-(8—37) (5 × 10<jats:sup>−7</jats:sup> M) afforded a decrease by 49 ± 19% ( n = 5, P &lt; 0.05), without affecting CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reactivity ( n = 4). The combined application of both CGRP-(8—37) and atropine further attenuated CSD hyperperfusion (by 69 ± 17%, n = 5, P &lt; 0.05). After chronic NCN and PSN transection brain topical superfusion of CGRP-(8—37) (5 × 10<jats:sup>−7</jats:sup> M) reduced CSD hyperperfusion slightly by 9.5 ± 5% ( n = 3). Atropine (10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> M) afforded a decrease by 17 ± 6% ( n = 3). These reductions were not statistically significant. We conclude that CSD-associated hyperperfusion is mediated in part by a depolarization of trigeminal sensory and parasympathetic nerve fibers, resulting in a release of vasoactive trigeminal and parasympathetic neurotransmitters. </jats:p>",0
Anoxia on slow inward currents of immature hippocampal neurons,"<jats:p> 1. The effects of brief anoxia (2-4 min) on membrane currents--especially the tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive, Cd2+-sensitive slow inward currents, presumed to be Ca2+ currents--were studied by single-electrode voltage clamp in CA1 and CA3 neurons in submerged hippocampal slices from adult and newborn Wistar rats (PN1-13). 2. In mature neurons, anoxia had no effect on Q-type inward relaxations, but slowly activating C-type outward currents were depressed. The most striking change was the suppression of Ca inward currents (especially the slowly inactivating L-type, by greater than 95%). This effect of anoxia was not sensitive to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, D-aminophosphonovalerate. Anoxia also reversibly abolished the NMDA-evoked inward current. 3. In neurons from newborn animals (PN1-6), Q-type inward relaxations and postanoxic outward currents were very small or undetectable. The slow inward (Ca) currents were smaller than in mature cells, but they showed a clearer separation between low-threshold, fast-inactivating and high-threshold, slowly inactivating currents. Both types of current were more resistant to anoxia (mean depression of L-type was by only 53.3 +/- 5.6%, mean +/- SE). 4. In such immature neurons, the NMDA-evoked inward currents were also more resistant to anoxia. 5. By PN7-13, increasing maturation was reflected in 1) larger voltage-dependent inward currents, 2) increasingly evident Q-type relaxations and postanoxic outward currents, and 3) near-complete blockade of inward currents by anoxia (at PN11-13, mean depression of L-type currents was by 98.5 +/- 1.5%). </jats:p>",0
Impaired Bidirectional Synaptic Plasticity and Procedural Memory Formation in Striatum-Specific cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein-Deficient Mice,"<jats:p>The striatum has a well documented role in procedural learning and memory. However, the synaptic and molecular mechanisms of acquisition and storage of this form of memory remain poorly understood. We examined procedural memory and plasticity in transgenic mice reversibly expressing a dominant-negative cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) mutant in the dorsal striatum. In these transgenic mice, corticostriatal long-term potentiation and depression are abolished, indicating that CREB function is essential for bidirectional long-term synaptic plasticity in this structure. Importantly, CREB-deficient animals show reversible alterations in several forms of striatum-dependent memory, including footshock avoidance learning and “response” learning in the cross maze. These findings implicate transcriptional regulation by CREB family transcription factors in striatum-dependent information processing and provide the first clear correlation between procedural learning and memory and synaptic plasticity at the corticostriatal synapse.</jats:p>",0

"A tetracycline derivative, minocycline, reduces inflammation and protects against focal cerebral ischemia with a wide therapeutic window","<jats:p>The only treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke is thrombolytic therapy, which benefits only a fraction of stroke patients. Both human and experimental studies indicate that ischemic stroke involves secondary inflammation that significantly contributes to the outcome after ischemic insult. Minocycline is a semisynthetic second-generation tetracycline that exerts antiinflammatory effects that are completely separate from its antimicrobial action. Because tetracycline treatment is clinically well tolerated, we investigated whether minocycline protects against focal brain ischemia with a wide therapeutic window. Using a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, we show that daily treatment with minocycline reduces cortical infarction volume by 76 ± 22% when the treatment is started 12 h before ischemia and by 63 ± 35% when started even 4 h after the onset of ischemia. The treatment inhibits morphological activation of microglia in the area adjacent to the infarction, inhibits induction of IL-1β-converting enzyme, and reduces cyclooxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin E<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>production. Minocycline had no effect on astrogliosis or spreading depression, a wave of ionic transients thought to contribute to enlargement of cortical infarction. Treatment with minocycline may act directly on brain cells, because cultured primary neurons were also salvaged from glutamate toxicity. Minocycline may represent a prototype of an antiinflammatory compound that provides protection against ischemic stroke and has a clinically relevant therapeutic window.</jats:p>",0

Role of mitochondrial electron transport complex I in coenzyme Q<sub>1</sub>reduction by intact pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and the effect of hyperoxia,"<jats:p>The objective was to determine the impact of intact normoxic and hyperoxia-exposed (95% O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>for 48 h) bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells in culture on the redox status of the coenzyme Q<jats:sub>10</jats:sub>homolog coenzyme Q<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>(CoQ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>). When CoQ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>(50 μM) was incubated with the cells for 30 min, its concentration in the medium decreased over time, reaching a lower level for normoxic than hyperoxia-exposed cells. The decreases in CoQ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>concentration were associated with generation of CoQ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>hydroquinone (CoQ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), wherein 3.4 times more CoQ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>was produced in the normoxic than hyperoxia-exposed cell medium (8.2 ± 0.3 and 2.4 ± 0.4 μM, means ± SE, respectively) after 30 min. The maximum CoQ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>reduction rate for the hyperoxia-exposed cells, measured using the cell membrane-impermeant redox indicator potassium ferricyanide, was about one-half that of normoxic cells (11.4 and 24.1 nmol·min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>·mg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>cell protein, respectively). The mitochondrial electron transport complex I inhibitor rotenone decreased the CoQ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>reduction rate by 85% in the normoxic cells and 44% in the hyperoxia-exposed cells.

Selective cholinergic immunolesioning affects synaptic plasticity in developing visual cortex,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cholinergic neurotransmission is known to affect activity‐dependent plasticity in various areas, including the visual cortex. However, relatively little is known about the exact role of subcortical cholinergic inputs in the regulation of plastic events in this region during early postnatal development. In the present study, synaptic transmission and plasticity in the developing visual cortex were studied following selective immunotoxic removal of the basal forebrain cholinergic afferents in 4‐day‐old rat pups. The lesion produced dramatic cholinergic neuronal and terminal fibre loss associated with decreased mRNA levels for the M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and M<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> muscarinic receptors, as well as clear‐cut impairments of long‐term potentiation (LTP) in visual cortex slices. Indeed, after theta burst stimulation of layer IV a long‐term depression (LTD) instead of an LTP was induced in immunolesioned slices. This functional change appears to be due to the lack of cholinergic input as exogenous application of acetylcholine prevented the shift from LTP to LTD. In addition, lesioned rats showed an increased sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh). While application of 20 µ<jats:sc>m</jats:sc> ACh produced a depression of the field potential in immunolesioned rat slices, in order to observe the same effect in control slices we had to increase ACh concentration to up to 200 µ<jats:sc>m</jats:sc>. Taken together, our results indicate that deprivation of cholinergic input affects synaptic transmission and plasticity in developing visual cortex, suggesting that the cholinergic system could play an active role in the refinement of the cortical circuitry during maturation.</jats:p>",0

The Effect on Total Renal and Tubular Function and Plasma Renin of a Moderate Isotonic Saline Load in Rats Anesthetized with Amytal and Inactin,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The renal effects of i.v. saline loading equal to 1% body weight (b.wt.) were studied in 2 groups of rats:<jats:italic>group I</jats:italic>was anesthetized with Amytal (15 mg/100 g b.wt. plus supplementary doses),<jats:italic>group II</jats:italic>with Inactin (12.5–15.0 mg/100 g b.wt).<jats:italic>In group I</jats:italic>the saline load caused an increase in urine flow (+ 92%), solute excretion (+ 67%), inulin clearance (C<jats:sub>IN</jats:sub>) (+ 24%), PAH clearance (+ 31%) and absolute proximal reabsorption rate (+ 27%). Proximal fractional reabsorption and filtration fraction (FF) remained unchanged, while plasma oncotic pressure (COP) decreased by 10%. Plasma renin fell and there was an inverse relationship between renin concentration and proximal reabsorption rate. In<jats:italic>group II</jats:italic>urine flow and solute excretion increased after saline (+ 85% and 110%, respectively); C<jats:sub>IN</jats:sub>and absolute proximal reabsorption rate was lower than in group I and failed to increase after saline. Proximal fractional reabsorption was also lower and decreased after saline. COP as well as renin decreased as in group I, but no relationship between renin concentration and proximal reabsorption rate could be demonstrated. The data indicate that Inactin depresses both resting proximal tubular reabsorptive capacity and the tubular response to a physiological volume expansion. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the renin‐angiotensin system is significantly involved in regulation of proximal tubular function, while they are incompatible with the idea that peritubular COP plays any major role in this adjustment.</jats:p>",1

Neurogranin/RC3 Enhances Long-Term Potentiation and Learning by Promoting Calcium-Mediated Signaling,"<jats:p>In neurons, neurogranin (Ng) binds calmodulin (CaM), and its binding affinity is reduced by increasing Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>, phosphorylation by PKC, or oxidation by oxidants. Ng concentration in the hippocampus of adult mice varied broadly (Ng<jats:sup>+/+</jats:sup>, ∼160-370 and Ng<jats:sup>+/-</jats:sup>, ∼70-230 pmol/mg); the level in Ng<jats:sup>+/+</jats:sup>mice is one of the highest among all neuronal CaM-binding proteins. Among Ng<jats:sup>+/-</jats:sup>mice, but less apparent in Ng<jats:sup>+/+</jats:sup>, a significant relationship existed between their hippocampal levels of Ng and performances in the Morris water maze. Ng<jats:sup>-/-</jats:sup>mice performed poorly in this task; they also displayed deficits in high-frequency-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 of hippocampal slices, whereas low-frequency-induced long-term depression was enhanced. Thus, compared with Ng<jats:sup>+/+</jats:sup>mice, the frequency-response curve of Ng<jats:sup>-/-</jats:sup>shifted to the right. Paired-pulse facilitation and synaptic fatigue during prolonged stimulation at 10 Hz (900 pulses) were unchanged in Ng<jats:sup>-/-</jats:sup>slices, indicating their normal presynaptic function. Measurements of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>transients in CA1 pyramidal neurons after weak and strong tetanic stimulations (100 Hz, 400 and 1000 msec, respectively) revealed a significantly greater intracellular Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>([Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>]<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>) response in Ng<jats:sup>+/+</jats:sup>compared with Ng<jats:sup>-/-</jats:sup>mice, but the decay time constants did not differ. The diminished Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>dynamics in Ng<jats:sup>-/-</jats:sup>mice are a likely cause of their decreased propensity to undergo LTP. Thus, Ng may promote a high [Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>]<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>by a “mass-action” mechanism; namely, the higher the Ng concentration, the more Ng-CaM complexes will be formed, which effectively raises [Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>]<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>at any given Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>influx. This mechanism provides potent signal amplification in enhancing synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory.</jats:p>",0
Compensatory proteome adjustments imply tissue-specific structural and metabolic reorganization following episodic hypoxia or anoxia in the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum),"<jats:p>The epaulette shark ( Hemiscyllium ocellatum ) represents an ancestral vertebrate model of episodic hypoxia and anoxia tolerance at tropical temperatures. We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches, combined with a suite of physiological measures, to characterize this species' responses to 1) one episode of anoxia plus normoxic recovery, 2) one episode of severe hypoxia plus recovery, or 3) two episodes of severe hypoxia plus recovery. We examined these responses in the cerebellum and rectal gland, two tissues with high ATP requirements. Sharks maintained plasma ionic homeostasis following all treatments, and activities of Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-ATPase and caspase 3/7 in both tissues were unchanged. Oxygen lack and reoxygenation elicited subtle adjustments in the proteome. Hypoxia led to more extensive proteome responses than anoxia in both tissues. The cerebellum and rectal gland exhibited treatment-specific responses to oxygen limitation consistent with one or more of several strategies: 1) neurotransmitter and receptor downregulation in cerebellum to prevent excitotoxicity, 2) cytoskeletal/membrane reorganization, 3) metabolic reorganization and more efficient intracellular energy shuttling that are more consistent with sustained ATP turnover than with long-term metabolic depression, 4) detoxification of metabolic byproducts and oxidative stress in light of continued metabolic activity, particularly following hypoxia in rectal gland, and 5) activation of prosurvival signaling. We hypothesize that neuronal morphological changes facilitate prolonged protection from excitotoxicity via dendritic spine remodeling in cerebellum (i.e., synaptic structural plasticity). These results recapitulate several highly conserved themes in the anoxia and hypoxia tolerance, preconditioning, and oxidative stress literature in a single system. In addition, several of the identified pathways and proteins suggest potentially novel mechanisms for enhancing anoxia or hypoxia tolerance in vertebrates. Overall, our data show that episodic hypoxic or anoxic exposure and recovery in the epaulette shark amplifies a constitutive suite of compensatory mechanisms that further prepares them for subsequent insults.</jats:p>",0

Behavioral Effects of Levonantradol and Nantradol in the Rhesus Monkey,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> In rhesus monkeys, acute administration of levonantradol and nantradol produced signs of CNS depression, including ataxia with body sag, pupil dilation, ptosis, dozing, and reduced responsivity to external stimuli. Neither compound suppressed the morphine withdrawal syndrome; however, both alleviated the chronic abdominal contraction associated with withdrawal. The directly observable effects of these compounds were not antagonized by naloxone. When levonantradol was administered every 6 hours, marked tolerance developed to both the effects of levonantradol and nabilone and THC. No signs of withdrawal were observed when levonantradol injections were abruptly discontinued. When substituted in lieu of codeine under an intravenous drug self‐administration procedure, neither levonantradol nor nantradol maintained responding at rates higher than those maintained by their vehicle. Finally, the discriminative effects of levonantradol were not equivalent to those of the narcotics ethylketazocine or etorphine.</jats:p>",0

The Effects of Δ<sup>9</sup>-Tetrahydrocannabinol on Action Potentials in the Mollusc <i>Aplysia</i>,"<jats:p> The effects of Δ<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>-THC) on action potentials were examined during intrasomatic recordings from the isolated buccal and parieto–visceral ganglia of Aplysia californica. When added to the saline solution bathing the preparation, the compound (in concentrations 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup>–10<jats:sup>−5</jats:sup> M) caused a reduction in spike overshoot (15–20% of total amplitude) and increased the lability of responses to electrical stimulation. The somatic membrane appeared to be more affected than the axonal membrane. Diffusion barriers in the ganglion probably account for the high degree of variability in drug response, such that both of the characteristic changes were observed in only about 30% of the tests. This is the first report to describe effects of Δ<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>-THC on invertebrate neurones. The results indicate that Δ<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>-THC causes a depression in nerve cell excitability, and these data are consistent with reported effects of THC compounds in mammals. </jats:p>",1

Long-term potentiation and long-term depression of primary afferent neurotransmission in the rat spinal cord,"<jats:p>Synaptic transmission between dorsal root afferents and neurons in the superficial laminae of the spinal dorsal horn (laminae I-III) was examined by intracellular recording in a transverse slice preparation of rat spinal cord. Brief high-frequency electrical stimulation (300 pulses at 100 Hz) of primary afferent fibers produced a long-term potentiation (LTP) or a long-term depression (LTD) of fast (monosynaptic and polysynaptic) EPSPs in a high proportion of dorsal horn neurons. Both the AMPA and the NMDA receptor-mediated components of synaptic transmission at the primary afferent synapses with neurons in the dorsal horn can exhibit LTP and LTD of the synaptic responses. In normal and neonatally capsaicin-treated rats, the induction of LTP requires the activation of NMDA receptor-gated conductances. The induction of LTP or LTD, however, was not abolished in the presence of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist. The results demonstrate that distinct and long-lasting modulation in synaptic efficiency can be induced at primary afferent synapses with neurons in the superficial laminae of spinal dorsal horn by high-frequency stimulation of dorsal root afferents and that these changes may be physiologically relevant for transmission and integration of sensory information, including pain.</jats:p>",0

Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors induces long‐term potentiation in vivo in the intact mouse dentate gyrus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The present study was conducted to clarify the role of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) on long‐term potentiation (LTP) in vivo in the intact mouse dentate gyrus using extracellular recording techniques. Intraperitoneal application of nicotine at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg but not 0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg produced a gradually developing, long‐lasting increase for 120 min similar to tetanic LTP. Nicotine at a dose of 9.0 mg/kg caused a temporary increase followed by depression. The long‐lasting potentiation induced by nicotine at 3.0 mg/kg, which was named nicotinic long‐term potentiation (LTPn), and tetanic LTP were significantly suppressed by pretreatment with mecamylamine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), a nonselective nicotinic antagonist, but not affected by postapplication of mecamylamine. Interestingly, choline, a selective α7 nAChR agonist, at 3.0–90 mg/kg, induced the long‐lasting potentiation similar to LTPn in a dose‐dependent manner in vivo in the intact mouse dentate gyrus. The long‐lasting potentiation induced by choline (30 mg/kg i.p.) was additionally increased by postapplication of nicotine (3.0 mg/kg i.p.) or tetanic stimulation. The present study revealed that systemic application of nicotine or choline induced the long‐lasting potentiation in vivo in the intact mouse dentate gyrus, suggesting that α7 nAChRs may contribute to the induction of LTP by nicotine, and supporting in vivo animal studies that nicotine improves learning and memory performance.</jats:p>",0

Calcium reverses global and regional myocardial dysfunction caused by the combination of verapamil and halothane,"<jats:p>In order to evaluate the effects of the combination of halothane and verapamil on left ventricular function and coronary blood flow (CBF), six sheep were anaesthetized with halothane (1.2% inspired) and given increasing cumulative doses of intravenous verapamil. Regional myocardial function was assessed by sonomicrometry in the areas supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and the left circumflex coronary artery (LC). Changes in global haemodynamics, atrioventricular conduction, LV relaxation and systolic shortening alter 0.32 mg·kg<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> intravenous verapamil indicated impaired left ventricular function. Significant myocardial dysfunction (post‐systolic shortening) occurred in the LAD territory, accompanied by a 64% decrease (42 ± 6 to 15 ± 3, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) in coronary perfusion pressure (CPP). Coronary blood flow in the LC segment decreased 83% (102 ± 15 to 17 ± 13, P &lt; 0.01) as coronary reserve was exhausted with the decrease in CPP. Calcium chloride reversed the impairment of global and regional myocardial function observed with verapamil, improved the impaired left ventricular relaxation, but did not significantly alter atrioventricular conduction. Thus the combination halothane‐verapamil can cause significant left ventricular depression and myocardial dysfunction, possibly by inducing suhendocardial ischaemia or by direct pharmacologic effect. calcium chloride reverses this regional myocardial dysfunction as well as the deleterious global haemodynamic changes caused by halothane‐verapamil; however, the changes in atrioventricular conduction are not corrected by calcium.</jats:p>",0

An HDAC-dependent epigenetic mechanism that enhances the efficacy of the antidepressant drug fluoxetine,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Depression is a prevalent and debilitating psychiatric illnesses. However, currently prescribed antidepressant drugs are only efficacious in a limited group of patients. Studies on Balb/c mice suggested that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition may enhance the efficacy of the widely-prescribed antidepressant drug fluoxetine. This study shows that reducing HDAC activity in fluoxetine-treated Balb/c mice leads to robust antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. While reducing the activity of class I HDACs 1 and 3 led to antidepressant effects, additional class II HDAC inhibition was necessary to exert anxiolytic effects. In fluoxetine-treated mice, HDAC inhibitors increased enrichment of acetylated histone H4 protein and RNA polymerase II at promotor 3 of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene and increased Bdnf transcription from this promotor. Reducing Bdnf-stimulated tropomyosin kinase B receptor activation in fluoxetine-treated mice with low HDAC activity abolished the behavioral effects of fluoxetine, suggesting that the HDAC-triggered epigenetic stimulation of Bdnf expression is critical for therapeutic efficacy.</jats:p>",1

Prostaglandin Action on Noradrenaline Release and Mechanical Responses in the Stimulated Guinea Pig Vas Deferens,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>PGE<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and PGE<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reversibly and dose‐dependently inhibited transmitter release from the stimulated guinea pig vas deferens. The two compounds proved equiactive and more prone to inhibit transmitter release at a low than at a high stimulation frequency. The PGEs inhibited the twitch response but produced inconsistent effects on contractions induced by prolonged stimulation. The difference may be due to the fact that the PGEs reduce the excitatory junction potentials and depolarize the effector cell membrane. Phenoxybenzamine increased transmitter release in response to nerve stimulation but failed to significantly alter the inhibitory effect of PGE<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. It is therefore concluded that PGEs and presumed presynoptic α‐receptors probably intrude upon different levels of the process of excitation secretor, coupling.

Maturation in properties of motoneurons and their segmental input in the neonatal rat,"<jats:p> 1. The isolated neonatal rat spinal chord preparation was used to investigate the development of segmental afferent input to lumbar motoneourons during the first nine postnatal days. Motoneurons, identified with the use of antidromic stimulation of the ventral roots, were characterized electrophysiologically, and their synaptic input in response to stimulation of the homologous dorsal root was studied. 2. Motoneurons in postnatal day (P) 1–3 preparations exhibited lower rheobase and lower input conductance than those impaled in spinal cords taken from animals at P7-9. This finding is consistent with the increase in motoneuron size known to occur during this time. 3. Monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked at low-frequency (0.1-Hz) stimulation in high-Ca2+ saline exhibited no change in mean amplitude between P1-3 and P7-9 despite an increase in input conductance of the motoneurons, suggesting that some aspect of these synapses underwent a compensatory change. Polysynaptic EPSPs were smaller in the older animals. 4. When bursts of stimuli were delivered at higher frequencies ranging from 10 to 167 Hz, the EPSPs exhibited substantial depression. The depression of monosynaptic EPSPs was significantly less at P7-9 than at P1-3. Changing the bathing solution from a high-Ca2+ saline to a low-Ca2+/high-Mg2+ saline reduced the amplitude of the monosynaptic EPSP and made it less susceptible to depression during high-frequency stimulation. Facilitation of the evoked response, which has been observed in the adult rat, was never seen under any of these conditions. 5. Although synapses on high-rheobase motoneurons exhibited less depression than those on low-rheobase motoneurons, as anticipated from previous results in adults, the EPSPs at synapses on high-rheobase motoneurons tended to be larger in amplitude, not smaller as expected. This suggests that the specialization among synapses on motoneurons that exists in adults has not yet developed by P7-9. Instead, EPSP amplitude may be greater in motoneurons that have been growing rapidly, such as the high-rheobase motoneurons found during these stages of development. 6. Evidence is presented that the growing diversity shown in modulation behavior at the Ia afferent motoneuron synapse during the first postnatal week is determined primarily by motoneuron characteristics. It is speculated that as motoneurons grow during the immediate postnatal period, the presynaptic terminal regions of axons terminating on them become specialized to render the synapse less susceptible to depression. This specialization may be myelination of the afferent terminals or may perhaps be related to the transmitter release process itself. The adult distribution of depression develops later, presumably as the components of the monosynaptic reflex mature. </jats:p>",0

Cardiovascular Effects of and Interaction Between Calcium Blocking Drugs and Anesthetics in Chronically Instrumented Dogs. V. Role of Pharmacokinetics and the Autonomic Nervous System in the Interactions Between Verapamil and Inhalational Anesthetics,"<jats:p>To assess the role of both pharmacokinetics and the autonomic nervous system in the interaction between inhalational anesthetics and verapamil, dogs were chronically instrumented to measure heart rate, PR interval, dP/dt, cardiac output, and aortic blood pressure. In a first group of seven dogs, studied awake and during halothane (1.2%), enflurane (2.5%), and isoflurane anesthesia (1.6%), verapamil was infused for 30 min in doses calculated to obtain similar plasma concentrations (83 ± 10, 82 ± 6, 81 ± 10, and 77 ± 9 ng • ml<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively). For the latter purpose, the infusion dose was 3 and 2 µg • kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> •min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> awake and during anesthesia, respectively, preceded by a loading dose of 200, 150, and 100 µg • kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, awake, during isoflurane, and halothane and enflurane, respectively. In awake dogs, verapamil induced an increase in heart rate (24 ± 5 bpm) and PR interval (35 ± 9 msec) and a decrease in mean arterial pressure (−5 ± 2 mmHg) and dP/dt (−494 ± 116 mmHg/s). Although plasma concentrations were similar in awake and in anesthetized dogs, the only statistically significant changes induced by verapamil were an increase in heart rate and a decrease in dP/dt during halothane and enflurane, while left atrial pressure increased only with enflurane. In a second group of six dogs, verapamil pharmacokinetics were determined in the presence and absence of a ganglionic blocking drug (chlorisondamine, 2 mg • kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> iv). Blockade of ganglionic transmission resulted in a decrease in both initial volume of distribution and total clearance of verapamil—changes similar to those previously reported with inhalational anesthetics.<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> The authors' data demonstrate the importance of pharmacokinetics in the interaction between verapamil and inhalational anesthetics.

Frequency-dependent effects of calcium antagonists on atrioventricular conduction and refractoriness: demonstration and characterization in anesthetized dogs.,"<jats:p>Calcium-channel blockers are known to affect slow inward current in a frequency-dependent fashion. The purpose of these experiments was to study use-dependent effects of verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine on atrioventricular conduction in vivo. Loading and maintenance infusion techniques were developed to study each drug at a series of stable plasma concentrations in autonomically blocked dogs anesthetized with morphine and alpha-chloralose. All three agents produced changes in atrioventricular conduction and refractoriness that increased with increasing stimulation frequency. The time dependence of drug-induced changes in atrioventricular conduction was characterized both by varying the coupling of single test stimuli and by abruptly changing activation frequency. The time constants for onset of (tau on) and recovery from (tau off) block were typical for each drug, with nifedipine having a faster time constant (tau off = 0.36 +/- 0.12 sec) than verapamil (tau off = 3.2 +/- 1.0 sec, tau on = 28 +/- 8 sec) or diltiazem (tau off = 2.7 +/- 1.2 sec, tau on = 13 +/- 4 sec). The time constants for each drug were independent of concentration but the magnitude of time-dependent change increased with increasing drug concentration. We conclude that calcium-channel blockers have important frequency-dependent effects on atrioventricular conduction in vivo. This frequency dependence may result in selective depression of atrioventricular conduction in the presence of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, with important potential implications for the clinical use of these agents.</jats:p>",0

Behavioral stress modifies hippocampal plasticity through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation.,"<jats:p>Behavioral stress has detrimental effects on subsequent cognitive performance in many species, including humans. For example, humans exposed to stressful situations typically exhibit marked deficits in various learning and memory tasks. However, the underlying neural mechanisms by which stress exerts its effects on learning and memory are unknown. We now report that in adult male rats, stress (i.e., restraint plus tailshock) impairs long-term potentiation (LTP) but enhances long-term depression (LTD) in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, a structure implicated in learning and memory processes. These effects on LTP and LTD are prevented when the animals were given CGP39551 (the carboxyethylester of CGP 37849; DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid), a competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, before experiencing stress. In contrast, the anxiolytic drug diazepam did not block the stress effects on hippocampal plasticity. Thus, the effects of stress on subsequent LTP and LTD appear to be mediated through the activation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors. Such modifications in hippocampal plasticity may contribute to learning and memory impairments associated with stress.</jats:p>",0
Central and Peripheral Catecholamine Levels after Pyrazole Treatment,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> Pyrazole (50 to 300 mg/kg intraperitoneally) given to male rats produced a decrease in body weight. A dose dependent fall in the noradrenaline content of the brain was observed, but no changes occurred in the central levels of dopamine or 5‐hydroxytryptamine. Even a single dose of pyrazole (100 mg/kg) decreased the noradrenaline content by 20 %. Successive doses had an additive effect which was maximal 24 hrs after the final dose. Recovery was quite rapid, but 3 days after the final administration the levels were still lower than in the controls. The noradrenaline content of the heart and spleen was also slightly reduced. The adrenaline content of the adrenals seemed unaffected by the treatment. It is concluded that pyrazole administration in the dose and time schedules used, markedly reduces the noradrenaline content of the central nervous system. This should be kept in mind when this substance is combined with ethanol in similar studies.</jats:p>",0

Introgression patterns in the mosaic hybrid zone between<i>Mytilus edulis</i>and<i>M. galloprovincialis</i>,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Hybrid zones are fascinating systems to investigate the structure of genetic barriers. Marine hybrid zones deserve more investigation because of the generally high dispersion potential of planktonic larvae which allows migration on scales unrivalled by terrestrial species. Here we analyse the genetic structure of the mosaic hybrid zone between the marine mussels<jats:italic>Mytilus edulis</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>M. galloprovincialis</jats:italic>, using three length‐polymorphic PCR loci as neutral and diagnostic markers on 32 samples along the Atlantic coast of Europe. Instead of a single genetic gradient from<jats:italic>M. galloprovincialis</jats:italic>on the Iberian Peninsula to<jats:italic>M. edulis</jats:italic>populations in the North Sea, three successive transitions were observed in France. From South to North, the frequency of alleles typical of<jats:italic>M. galloprovincialis</jats:italic>first decreases in the southern Bay of Biscay, remains low in Charente, then increases in South Brittany, remains high in most of Brittany, and finally decreases again in South Normandy. The two enclosed patches observed in the midst of the mosaic hybrid zone in Charente and Brittany, although predominantly<jats:italic>M. edulis</jats:italic>‐like and<jats:italic>M. galloprovincialis</jats:italic>‐like, respectively, are genetically original in two respects. First, considering only the various alleles typical of one species, the patches show differentiated frequencies compared to the reference external populations. Second, each patch is partly introgressed by alleles of the other species. When introgression is taken into account, linkage disequilibria appear close to their maximum possible values, indicating a strong genetic barrier within all transition zones. Some pre‐ or postzygotic isolation mechanisms (habitat specialization, spawning asynchrony, assortative fertilization and hybrid depression) have been documented in previous studies, although their relative importance remains to be evaluated. We also provided evidence for a recent migratory ‘short‐cut’ connecting<jats:italic>M. edulis</jats:italic>‐like populations of the Charente patch to an external<jats:italic>M. edulis</jats:italic>population in Normandy and thought to reflect artificial transfer of spat for aquaculture.</jats:p>",0

Increased levels of NMDA receptor NR2A subunits at pre‐ and postsynaptic sites of the hippocampal CA1: An early response to conditional double knockout of presenilin 1 and 2,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Greater than 90% of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to mutations of presenilin (PS), and the loss of PS function altogether within mouse brains by conditional double knockout of the PS 1 and 2 genes (PS‐cDKO) leads to age‐dependent emergence of AD phenotypes, including neurodegeneration and reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1. The goal of our study was to identify the ultrastructural and molecular changes at synapses in the hippocampal CA1 of this PS‐cDKO mouse model of AD. We examined the asymmetric (excitatory) synapses formed on apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons at 2 months postnatal, an age when AD‐like symptoms emerge but brain morphology, as assessed by light microscopy, is still normal. Our quantitative electron microscopic analyses confirm that PS‐cDKO hippocampi at 2 months postnatal do not yet exhibit synapse losses or spine size alterations. However, immunocytochemistry reveals that the same region exhibits a 28% increase in the proportion of spines labeled for the NR2A subunits of NMDA receptors (NMDAR), with a 31% increase specifically at postsynaptic densities and a concomitant reduction of these subunits at nonsynaptic sites within spine heads. In contrast, no change in levels or the distribution pattern of NR2B subunit levels were detected within spine heads. Presynaptically, NR2A levels are elevated at axo‐spinous junctions and these may contribute to the timing‐dependent, long‐term depression. These observations point to an early‐onset trapping of NMDAR at synapses that are subtle but may underlie the reduced synaptic plasticity at 2 months of age and excitotoxicity at later stages. J.

Potentiation by β‐Adrenoceptor Blocking Agents of the Inhibitory Effect of Adrenaline on Carrageenin‐Induced Rat Paw Oedema,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> The β‐adrenoceptor blocking agents (±)‐practolol, (±)‐propranolol, (—)‐propranolol and (±)‐sotalol were found to <jats:italic>reduce</jats:italic> the adrenaline induced inhibition of carrageenin‐induced rat paw oedema during the first hour of development and then <jats:italic>potentiate</jats:italic> adrenaline for at least 3 hours. Experiments carried out with (+)‐propranolol indicated that both effects depended on the levoisomers of the substances and accordingly on some kind of β‐blockade. It has previously been suggested that normal stores of endogenous catecholamines might be essential for the development of carrageenin‐induced rat paw oedema (ARNTZEN &amp; BRISEID 1973). Under the experimental conditions used in the present work (—)‐propranolol did not counteract the increase in the catecholamine content of the spleen caused by adrenaline injection, more than (+)‐propranolol. It is suggested that the marked potentiation of the oedema inhibition caused by adrenaline might be due to a combined effect of increased adrenaline stores and β‐adrenoceptor blockade.</jats:p>",0

Effect of repetitive activation on the afterhyperpolarization in dorsal spinocerebellar tract neurones.,"<jats:p>1. The changes in the afterhyperpolarization (a.h.p.) with repetitive activation have been studied in dorsal spinocerebellar tract cells of the cat using intracellular recording techniques. 2. The a.h.p. following a single spike was conditioned at different interspike intervals by a single preceding spike. In the majority of neurones the a.h.p. following a spike added approximately linearly with that generated by a preceding spike. 3. In other cells the a.h.p. following a spike was instead depressed by a preceding spike. THis depression was approximately constant at interspike intervals less than the a.h.p. duration (50‐100 msec). Thereafter the a.h.p. slowly recovered during the next 100‐300 msec. There was no associated decrease in the initial brief hyperpolarizing undershoot. 4. With shortlasting repetitive activation at high frequency (greater than 100 impulses/sec) the a.h.p, peak amplitude increased progressively with successive spikes (5‐15 spikes). No change in the time constant of decay was observed. A good correspondence was found between the observed increase in peak amplitude of the a.h.p.s and that given by a theoretical linear superposition of the successive a.h.p.s. 5. Changes in the brief hyperpolarizing undershoot with repetitive activation is also described.</jats:p>",0

Clemastine Enhances Myelination in the Prefrontal Cortex and Rescues Behavioral Changes in Socially Isolated Mice,"<jats:p>Altered myelin structure and oligodendrocyte function have been shown to correlate with cognitive and motor dysfunction and deficits in social behavior. We and others have previously demonstrated that social isolation in mice induced behavioral, transcriptional, and ultrastructural changes in oligodendrocytes of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, whether enhancing myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation could be beneficial in reversing such changes remains unexplored. To test this hypothesis, we orally administered clemastine, an antimuscarinic compound that has been shown to enhance oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>, for 2 weeks in adult mice following social isolation. Clemastine successfully reversed social avoidance behavior in mice undergoing prolonged social isolation. Impaired myelination was rescued by oral clemastine treatment, and was associated with enhanced oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation and epigenetic changes. Clemastine induced higher levels of repressive histone methylation (H3K9me3), a marker for heterochromatin, in oligodendrocytes, but not neurons, of the PFC. This was consistent with the capability of clemastine in elevating H3K9 histone methyltransferases activity in cultured primary mouse oligodendrocytes, an effect that could be antagonized by cotreatment with muscarine. Our data suggest that promoting adult myelination is a potential strategy for reversing depressive-like social behavior.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</jats:bold>Oligodendrocyte development and myelination are highly dynamic processes influenced by experience and neuronal activity. However, whether enhancing myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation is beneficial to treat depressive-like behavior has been unexplored. Mice undergoing prolonged social isolation display impaired myelination in the prefrontal cortex. Clemastine, a Food and Drug Administration-approved antimuscarinic compound that has been shown to enhance myelination under demyelinating conditions, successfully reversed social avoidance behavior in adult socially isolated mice. This was associated with enhanced myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation in the prefrontal cortex through epigenetic regulation. Thus, enhancing myelination may be a potential means of reversing depressive-like social behavior.</jats:p>",1

HYDIA is a potent and selective competitive antagonist of <jats:sc>L</jats:sc>‐glutamate at the mGlu2/3 receptors in spite of being structurally very similar to the bicyclic LY354740, which is a potent and selective mGlu2/3 agonist. By comparing these two ligands, this study delineate the interaction mode of <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H‐HYDIA at the mGlu2 receptor, using both mutagenesis studies and computational modeling. Binding of HYDIA in the closed conformation model of mGlu2 results in repulsive interaction with the Y216 residue, preventing closure of the binding pocket and thus receptor activation. Consequently, HYDIA is proposed to bind in an open conformation model of mGlu2. Mutation of the structurally important Y216 residue in the binding site caused complete loss of affinity of both <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H‐LY354740 and <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H‐HYDIA. T168 in lobe I was shown to have an important role in HYDIA binding, and in the open conformation model this residue is interacting with the amino group of HYDIA. The Y144 residue in lobe I is shown to be engaged in both receptor interlobe binding and ligand interaction. Receptor mutations at this position (Y144G, Y144S and Y144A) showed dramatic impact on binding affinity and functional effect of HYDIA. The mGlu2 receptor mutants with increased structural flexibility at this position, which is crucial for pocket closure, were clearly preferred. These studies highlight the unique properties of the novel <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H‐HYDIA ligand and provide further support to our understanding of binding and signal transduction mechanisms of the mGlu2 receptor.</jats:italic></jats:p>",0
Characterization of Endothelin Receptors in the Cerebral Vasculature and Their Lack of Effect on Spreading Depression,"<jats:p> The changes in cerebral blood flow that accompany spreading depression are well-described, as are parallel changes in cellular activity, with a wave of hyperemia followed by a prolonged oligemic phase. In this study, a cat model of the CBF changes associated with spreading depression and in vitro pharmacology were used to determine if there is a role for the powerful peptide vasoconstrictor endothelin in this response. For the pharmacological studies, the middle cerebral artery was harvested from cats postmortem. For the physiological studies, cats were anesthetized with halothane induction and α-chloralose (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal loading; 20 mg/kg i.v. 2-h maintenance). CBF was monitored continuously in the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry (CBF<jats:sub>LDF</jats:sub>) after exposure of the dura mater. The in vitro work demonstrated that endothelin-1 (ET-1) mediates a strong and potent contraction of cerebral vessels. Both the selective ET<jats:sub>A</jats:sub> receptor antagonist FR139317 and the combined ET<jats:sub>A</jats:sub> and ET<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> receptor antagonist Bosentan caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve without attenuation of the maximum effect. The calculated pA<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> values were 6.28 and 6.90, respectively. The slope did not differ from unity, suggesting that the ET-1-mediated contraction is evoked by a single population of ET<jats:sub>A</jats:sub> receptors, which were effectively antagonized by these compounds. Spreading depression was induced with a needle stick injury to the cortex. Local administration of the endothelin antagonists FR139317 (10 μ M) and Bosentan (10 μ M) did not affect resting blood flow in the cortex. Induction of spreading depression following local administration of FR139317 and Bosentan resulted in responses no different from those in control cortex. These data demonstrate that endothelin does not play a significant role in the vasoconstrictor portion of the CBF change seen in spreading depression, nor does it affect resting flow. Since it is widely held that spreading depression, or a very similar mechanism, underlies the aura phase of migraine, it may be suggested from these studies that endothelin antagonists are unlikely to be useful in migraine. </jats:p>",0

In vivo and in vitro imaging of I<sub>2</sub> imidazoline receptors in the monkey brain,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> imidazoline receptors (I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Rs) are associated with depression, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. However, in vivo imaging of I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Rs in the monkey brain has not been reported until now. We performed in vitro and in vivo imaging of (I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Rs) in the monkey brain using <jats:sup>11</jats:sup>C‐labeled 2‐(3‐fluoro‐4‐tolyl)‐4,5‐dihydro‐1<jats:italic>H</jats:italic>‐imidazole ([<jats:sup>11</jats:sup>C]FTIMD) which has high and selective affinity of I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Rs.

The specific binding of [<jats:sup>11</jats:sup>C]FTIMD accounted for &gt;97% of total binding in brain regions existing I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Rs.

Hippocampal Leptin Suppresses Methamphetamine‐Induced Hyperlocomotion,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> Leptin is an anorexigenic peptide which is synthesized in white adipose tissue. The actions of leptin are mediated by the leptin receptor which is abundantly localized in the hypothalamus and is involved in energy regulation and balance. Recently, there has been evidence suggesting that the leptin receptor is also present in the hippocampus and may be involved with hippocampal excitability and long‐term depression. To investigate the physiological function of leptin signalling in the hippocampus, we studied the effects of leptin on methamphetamine‐induced ambulatory hyperactivity by utilizing intra‐hippocampal infusion (i.h.) in mice. Our results show that the infusion of leptin (5 ng each bilaterally i.h.) does not affect the basal ambulatory activity but significantly suppresses methamphetamine‐induced ambulatory hyperactivity as compared to saline‐infused controls. Interestingly, higher dose of leptin increases the suppression of the methamphetamine‐induced ambulatory hyperactivity. The i.h. infusion of leptin did not activate the JAK‐STAT pathway, which is the cellular signalling pathway through which leptin acts in the hypothalamus. The infusion of leptin also did not affect activation of p42/44 MAPK which is known to be another leptin‐induced signalling pathway in the brain. These results demonstrate that leptin has a novel potential suppressive effect on methamphetamine‐induced hyperlocomotion and also suggest that there must be an alternative pathway in the hippocampus through which leptin signalling is being mediated.</jats:p>",0

Spontaneous Activity Defines Effective Convergence Ratios in an Inhibitory Circuit,"<jats:p>Many neurons fire spontaneously, and the rate of this firing is subject to neuromodulation. How this firing affects functional connectivity within a neural network remains largely unexplored. Here we show that changes in spontaneous firing of cartwheel interneurons in the mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) alter the effective convergence ratio of interneurons onto their postsynaptic targets through short-term synaptic plasticity. Spontaneous firing of cartwheel cells led to activity-dependent synaptic depression of individual cartwheel synapses. Depression was rapid and profound at stimulation frequencies between 10 and 200 Hz, suggesting the presence of high release probability (Pr) vesicles at these inhibitory synapses. Weak, transient synaptic facilitation could be induced after synapses were predepressed, indicating that low-Pr vesicles are also recruited, and may thus support steady-state transmission. A two-pool vesicle depletion model with 10-fold differences in Pr could account for the synaptic depression over a wide range of stimulus conditions. As a result of depression during high spontaneous activity, more cartwheel interneurons were required for effective inhibition. Convergence of four interneurons was sufficient to compensate for the effects of depression during physiologically expected rates of activity. By simulating synaptic release during spontaneous firing, we found that recruitment of low-Pr vesicles at the synapse plays a critical role in maintaining effective inhibition within a small population of interneurons. The interplay between spontaneous spiking, short-term synaptic plasticity, and vesicle recruitment thus determines the effective size of a convergent neural network.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</jats:bold>We examined the relationship between the structure of a small neural circuit and the properties of its individual synapses. Successful synaptic inhibition of a target cell firing requires a critical inhibitory synaptic strength. Synapses often become depressed during spontaneous presynaptic activity, and this increases the number of presynaptic neurons needed to mediate inhibition. We show that depression is limited by the presence of a pool of vesicles that resist depletion. Thus, the size of this vesicle pool determines the size of the circuit needed to mediate inhibition during different patterns of activity.</jats:p>",0
GPER1 Stimulation Alters Posttranslational Modification of RGSz1 and Induces Desensitization of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; Receptor Signaling in the Rat Hypothalamus,"<jats:p>Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a consistent biological characteristic of depression, and response normalization coincides with clinical responsiveness to antidepressant medications. Desensitization of serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R) signaling in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) follows selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant treatment and contributes to the antidepressant response. Estradiol alone produces a partial desensitization of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling and synergizes with SSRIs to result in a complete and more rapid desensitization than with SSRIs alone as measured by a decrease in the oxytocin and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) responses to 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R stimulation. G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) is necessary for estradiol-induced desensitization of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling, although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We now find that stimulation of GPER1 with the selective agonist G-1 and nonselective stimulation of estrogen receptors dramatically alter isoform expression of a key component of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling pathway, RGSz1, a GTPase-activating protein selective for Gαz, the Gα subunit necessary for 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated hormone release. RGSz1 isoforms are differentially glycosylated, SUMOylated, and phosphorylated, and differentially distributed in subcellular organelles. High-molecular-weight RGSz1 is SUMOylated and glycosylated, localized to the detergent-resistant microdomain (DRM) of the cell membrane, and increased by estradiol and G-1 treatment. Because activated Gαz also localizes to the DRM, increased DRM-localized RGSz1 by estradiol and G-1 could reduce Gαz activity, functionally uncoupling 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling. Peripheral G-1 treatment produced a partial reduction in oxytocin and ACTH responses to 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;R stimulation similar to direct injections into the PVN. Together, these results identify GPER1 and RGSz1 as novel targets for the treatment of depression.</jats:p>",1

Application of an optogenetic byway for perturbing neuronal activity via glial photostimulation,"<jats:p>Dynamic activity of glia has repeatedly been demonstrated, but if such activity is independent from neuronal activity, glia would not have any role in the information processing in the brain or in the generation of animal behavior. Evidence for neurons communicating with glia is solid, but the signaling pathway leading back from glial-to-neuronal activity was often difficult to study. Here, we introduced a transgenic mouse line in which channelrhodopsin-2, a light-gated cation channel, was expressed in astrocytes. Selective photostimulation of these astrocytes in vivo triggered neuronal activation. Using slice preparations, we show that glial photostimulation leads to release of glutamate, which was sufficient to activate AMPA receptors on Purkinje cells and to induce long-term depression of parallel fiber-to-Purkinje cell synapses through activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. In contrast to neuronal synaptic vesicular release, glial activation likely causes preferential activation of extrasynaptic receptors that appose glial membrane. Finally, we show that neuronal activation by glial stimulation can lead to perturbation of cerebellar modulated motor behavior. These findings demonstrate that glia can modulate the tone of neuronal activity and behavior. This animal model is expected to be a potentially powerful approach to study the role of glia in brain function.</jats:p>",0

Long‐term potentiation of transmitter release induced by repetitive presynaptic activities in bull‐frog sympathetic ganglia.,"<jats:p>Long‐lasting potentiation of transmitter release induced by repetitive presynaptic activities in bull‐frog sympathetic ganglia was studied by recording intracellularly fast excitatory post‐synaptic potentials (fast e.p.s.p.s.). Following a brief period of post‐tetanic potentiation or depression (less than 10 min), the amplitude of the fast e.p.s.p. was potentiated for a period between several tens of minutes and more than 2 h in response to tetanic stimulation of the preganglionic nerve in twenty‐one out of twenty‐eight cells. Quantal analysis revealed that this long‐term potentiation of the fast e.p.s.p. (l.t.p.) was accompanied by an increase in quantal content m (in nine out of twenty‐one cells), quantal size (four cells) or both (eight cells). The increased quantal content (presynaptic l.t.p.) declined exponentially (ten cells) or decayed gradually to a certain enhanced level which lasted several hours. In contrast, the increased quantal size grew with a relatively long latency (10‐25 min) and remained relatively constant for at least 2 h. The magnitude of presynaptic l.t.p. increased with increased duration of the presynaptic tetanus (33 Hz) from 2 to 5 s. No l.t.p. was elicited by a 1‐s tetanus, whereas the time course appears to be independent of the tetanus duration and the magnitude of l.t.p. There was a positive correlation between the magnitude of presynaptic l.t.p. and the pre‐tetanic quantal content up to m = 3, but the former deviated from linear regression when the value of the latter exceeded 3. No l.t.p. occurred when quantal content was less than 0.5. A tetanus (33 Hz, 10 s) applied in Ca2+‐free solution elicited no presynaptic l.t.p., while the same tetanus in normal Ringer solution produced a large presynaptic l.t.p. Presynaptic l.t.p. was enhanced in magnitude at low temperature (8‐10 degrees C). These results demonstrate the existence of a use‐dependent, long‐term potentiation of transmitter release in bull‐frog sympathetic ganglia. Several possible mechanisms are discussed in terms of Ca2+‐buffering mechanisms of the presynaptic nerve terminals.</jats:p>",0

&lt;i&gt;In vitro &lt;/i&gt;Relaxation of Arteries and Veins by Prazosin: Alpha-Adrenergic Blockade with No Direct Vasodilation,"<jats:p>Controversy exists regarding the mechanism by which prazosin lowers blood pressure without a marked increase in heart rate; a mechanism involving both sympatholytic activity and direct smooth muscle relaxation has been suggested. α-Adrenergic receptor blockade by prazosin is well documented and occurred to exogenous norepinephrine and to field stimulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; in rat arteries and veins. A parallel shift of the norepinephrine concentration response curves in the aorta and mesenteric artery contrasted with a nonparallel shift and a marked depression of maximal norepinephrine responses in the inferior vena cava, portal, iliac and femoral veins. Nonspecific direct acting vasodilators will antagonize contractile responses to all agonists. However, prazosin (10&lt;sup&gt;–8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt; M&lt;/i&gt;) specifically antagonized norepinephrine-induced responses. Concentration response curves to potassium chloride or to serotonin were not affected in these rat tissues. In addition, prazosin (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;–6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;) did not significantly relax aortic tissue previously contracted with potassium chloride or serotonin, whereas the vasodilator, nitroglycerin, produced a clear relaxation. Prazosin only reduced the tone of vessels contracted with norepinephrine. These data indicate that prazosin exhibits minimal, if any, direct smooth muscle relaxant properties in concentrations higher than those producing α-adrenergic receptor blockade, and relaxes rat veins by a mechanism involving α-adrenergic receptor blockade.</jats:p>",0

Knockout mice in understanding the mechanism of action of lithium,"<jats:p>Lithium inhibits IMPase (inositol monophosphatase) activity, as well as inositol transporter function. To determine whether one or more of these mechanisms might underlie lithium's behavioural effects, we studied Impa1 (encoding IMPase) and Smit1 (sodium–myo-inositol transporter 1)-knockout mice. In brains of adult homozygous Impa1-knockout mice, IMPase activity was found to be decreased; however, inositol levels were not found to be altered. Behavioural analysis indicated decreased immobility in the forced-swim test as well as a strongly increased sensitivity to pilocarpine-induced seizures. These are behaviours robustly induced by lithium. In homozygous Smit1-knockout mice, free inositol levels were decreased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. These animals behave like lithium-treated animals in the model of pilocarpine seizures and in the Porsolt forced-swim test model of depression. In contrast with O'Brien et al. [O'Brien, Harper, Jove, Woodgett, Maretto, Piccolo and Klein (2004) J. Neurosci. 24, 6791–6798], we could not confirm that heterozygous Gsk3b (glycogen synthase kinase 3β)-knockout mice exhibit decreased immobility in the Porsolt forced-swim test or decreased amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in a manner mimicking lithium's behavioural effects. These data support the role of inositol-related processes rather than GSK3β in the mechanism of the therapeutic action of lithium.</jats:p>",1

By means of the ECG doses of digoxin needed to cause ventricular extrasystoles (VES), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and asystole (AS) were determined in a control group without any premedication. Three groups were given a pre‐treatment with desipramine, phenytoin and reserpine. After AS digoxin concentrations in the heart muscle and in the kidneys were determined by radioimmunoassay. The concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline were also determined in these tissues. After reserpine and phenytoin the doses of digoxin needed to induce VF and AS were increased. Desipramine had no effect on digitalis‐induced arrhythmias. The relative uptake of digoxin in the heart muscle was decreased after all of the three premedications; there was no change in the kidney. The tissue catecholamine concentrations were decreased after reserpine and desipramine, but remained unchanged after phenytoin. The lethal dose of digoxin seemed not to correlate to the myocardial digoxin concentration after different premedications. The mechanism of the uptake in the heart muscle seemed to be different from that in the kidney. There was no correlation between the catecholamine concentration in myocardium and the ar‐rhythmogenic effect of digoxin in the different groups.</jats:p>",0

Pathogenesis of Rinderpest Virus Infection in Rabbits II. Effect of Rinderpest Virus on the Immune Functions of Rabbits,"<jats:p>Rinderpest virus infection was shown to induce marked suppression of both humoral antibody response and cell-mediated immunity in rabbits. The virus exhibited a suppressive effect on primary antibody response as indicated by a decrease in numbers of plaque-forming cells (immunoglobulin [Ig]M) and hemagglutinating antibody titers of both IgM and IgG types to sheep red blood cells, whereas there was no detectable effect of the virus on the production of memory cells. Virus-induced suppression of cell-mediated immunity was demonstrated by a decreased rate of proliferative response of peripheral lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin stimulus and by a depression of delayed-type skin reactions to purified protein derivative. Such suppressive effects were indicated to persist for 14 days or longer. Alteration in phagocytic activity of the reticuloendothelial system was not observed. The relevance of the virus-induced histological lesions in the lymphoid tissues to the virus-induced immunosuppression was discussed.</jats:p>",0

Regulation of the galanin system by repeated electroconvulsive seizures in mice,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Even though induction of seizures by electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) is a treatment widely used for major depression in humans, the working mechanism of ECS remains uncertain. The antiepileptic effect of ECS has been suggested to be involved in mediating the therapeutic effect of ECS. The neuropeptide galanin exerts antiepileptic and antidepressant‐like effects and has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. To explore a potential role of galanin in working mechanisms of ECS, the present study examined effects of repeated ECS on the galanin system using QRT‐PCR, in situ hybridization, and [<jats:sup>125</jats:sup>I]galanin receptor binding. ECS was administered to adult mice daily for 14 days, and this paradigm was confirmed to exert antidepressant‐like effect in the tail suspension test. Prominent increases in galanin gene expression were found in several brain regions involved in regulation of epileptic activity and depression, including the piriform cortex, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and amygdala. Likewise, GalR2 gene expression was up‐regulated in both the central and the medial amygdala, whereas GalR1 gene expression showed a modest down‐regulation in the medial amygdala. [<jats:sup>125</jats:sup>I]galanin receptor binding in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala was found to be significantly down‐regulated. These data show that the galanin system is regulated by repeated ECS in a number of brain regions implicated in seizure regulation and depression. These changes may play a role in the therapeutic effect of ECS. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",1

On the day following the operations, intact, anosmic, and anosmic‐Pinx animals began receiving single, daily afternoon (1700–1800 hours) subcutaneous injections of 50 μg of melatonin (MEL) for six weeks, while an additional group of intact controls received injections of diluent. At the end of this period, body, anterior pituitary, testicular, and seminal vesicle weights were significantly reduced in intact‐MEL‐treated animals. Anosmic animals that had been treated with MEL experienced a further, highly significant, 65%, 90%, and 85% depression in testicular, seminal vesicle, and ventral prostate weights, respectively, as compared with intact control and MEL‐treated rats. Additionally, both body and anterior pituitary weights were significantly decreased in MEL‐treated, anosmic rats. Anosmic‐Pinx rats treated with MEL had organ and body weights that were intermediate between those of intact‐MEL and anosmic‐MEL‐treated animals. Pituitary and serum levels of prolactin (Prl) were significantly lower in anosmic‐MEL‐treated rats than in intact or intact‐MEL‐treated groups. Similarly, Prl levels were depressed in the anosmic‐Pinx rats treated with MEL; however, serum Prl was not statistically lower than in intact or intact‐MEL‐treated animals. These results indicate that anosmic male rats have an increased sensitivity to antigonadotrophic and Prl‐inhibitory effects of MEL. Furthermore, the data suggest that the presence of the pineal gland in anosmic rats is important in permitting anosmia maximally to sensitize the neuroendocrine‐reproductive axis to the antigonadotrophic effects of exogenously administered MEL.</jats:p>",0

Control of interval‐force relation in canine ventricular myocardium studied with ryanodine,"<jats:p><jats:list list-type=""explicit-label"">
<jats:list-item><jats:p>The mechanism of post‐extrasystolic, rest and frequency potentiation was studied in canine isolated ventricular muscle.</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>Ryanodine, which impairs Ca availability from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), reduced the amplitude of the extrasystole less than that of the steady state contraction. Ryanodine also inhibited post‐extrasystolic potentiation and converted rest‐potentiation into rest depression. Rest‐potentiation was blocked preferentially by ryanodine compared to post‐extrasystolic potentiation. An increase in the contribution of extracellular Ca to the extrasystolic contraction could not entirely account for the post‐extrasystolic potentiation.</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>Prolonged rest, by itself, also caused depression of the first post‐rest contraction. During rest‐potentiation, SR Ca seemed to play a greater role in contraction than transmembrane Ca influx. However, the ability of the ‘release pool’ of Ca in the SR to be reprimed after a contraction was reduced. This was seen as a decrease in post‐extrasystolic potentiation elicited immediately after rest.</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>A decrease in stimulus interval was associated with a transient decrease in contraction amplitude followed by an increase. An abrupt increase in stimulus interval had the opposite effect. Ryanodine blocked the initial transient changes and accelerated the delayed changes. These results suggest that the transient changes in contraction after sudden changes in drive interval are dependent on the SR.</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>Transmembrane Ca entry and the rate of recovery of the Ca release process (repriming) in the SR after a contraction seem to be interval‐dependent. The data also indicate that different mechanisms are involved in post‐extrasystolic and rest‐potentiation.</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>The results are consistent with a model which proposes ‘recirculation’ of activator Ca within the SR after a contraction or of the presence of an appreciable amount of inactivation of the SR Ca release process during normal stimulation. An increased pool of releasable Ca due to longer recirculation time or a time‐dependent decay in the level of inactivation of Ca release from the SR may give rise to rest‐potentiation.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

High K+ effects on PAH transport and permeabilities in isolated snake renal tubules,"<jats:p> Effects of high potassium concentrations on para-aminohippurate (PAH) transport by isolated, perfused snake (Thamnophis spp.) distal-proximal renal tubules were studied. Increasing the potassium concentration in bath from 3 mM TO 10 mM OR 40 MM led to about 50% decrease in net PAH transport from bath to lumen in less than 10 min, but transport still occurred against concentration gradient. Cell water PAH concentration was not significantly depressed in 10 mMpotassium and was nearly double control level in 40 mM potassium. Apparent luminal membrane permeability to PAH, calculated from perfusion studies, averaged about 3.5 x 10(-5) cm sec(-1) in 3 mM potassium, 1.15 x 10(-5) cm sec(-1) in 10 mM potassium, and 0.48 x 10(-5) cm sec(-1) in 40 mM potassium. Apparent peritubular membrane permeability, determined from PAH efflux from tubules with oil-filled lumens averaged about 0.5 x 10(-5) cm sec(-1) in 3 mM potassium, 0.29 x 10(-5) cm sec(-1) in 10 mM potassium, and 0.17 x 10(-5) cm sec(-1) in 40 mM potassium. These data suggest that high potassium concentrations depress transepithelial PAH transport primarily by reducing luminal and peritubular membrane permeabilities. Effect of high potassium on PAH transport was reversed within 20 min after restoration of control potassium concentration. </jats:p>",0

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) inhibits the secretomotor response of the thyroid: effects of EGF on radioiodine turnover and fluid transport in cultured porcine thyroid cells,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
        <jats:p>Thyrotrophin (4-256 μU/ml) promoted an increase in the rate of release of radioiodine from the organic iodine pool of cultured porcine thyroid cells in follicular formations. This action of TSH was antagonized by low concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF; 0·1–5 nmol/l). The maximal effect of EGF was reached by 0·5 nmol/l. EGF (0·5–5 nmol/l) also inhibited the stimulatory effect of 8-chloro cyclic AMP (0·06–1·0 nmol/l) on radioiodine turnover. Exposure of thyroid cultures to media with a calcium concentration of 17·7 μmol/l (1% of normal) resulted in a very marked increase in the rate of release of radioiodine. The effect of TSH in low-calcium media was to inhibit the increased release of radioiodine, and EGF (0·5 nmol/l) antagonized this inhibitory effect of TSH. The calcium ionophore, A23187, stimulated radioiodine release in a dose-dependent fashion, and EGF (1·7 nmol/l) inhibited this response. Fluid transport in thyroid monolayers was stimulated by prostaglandin E<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (PGE<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>; 1 μmol/l). EGF (5 nmol/l) also stimulated fluid transport, but antagonized the effect of PGE<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> added subsequently. It was concluded that EGF exerted acute antagonistic effects on thyroid cell responses <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> to cyclic AMP and agents promoting accumulation of cyclic AMP in time-frames too short for these inhibitory effects to be attributable to the dedifferentiative effect of the growth factor.</jats:p>

Chronic oral administration of ginseng extract results in behavioral change but has no effects in mice models of affective and anxiety disorders,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ginseng is a popular ‘tonic’ herb in Chinese traditional medicine with diverse biological activity. The core of ginseng's therapeutic abilities is thought to be its neuroprotective actions in increasing cellular resilience.

Decreased Release of D‐Aspartate in the Guinea Pig Spinal Cord After Lesions of the Red Nucleus,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> This study attempts to determine if fibers that project from the guinea pig red nucleus to the spinal cord use L‐glutamate and/or L‐aspartate as transmitters. Unilateral injections of kainic acid were placed stereotaxically in the red nucleus to destroy the cells of origin of the rubrospinal tract. Six days after the injection, Nissl‐stained sections through the lesion site showed that the majority of neurons in the red nucleus ipsilateral to the kainic acid injection were destroyed. In addition, the lesioned area included parts of the surrounding midbrain reticular formation. Silver‐impregnated, transverse sections of the cervical spinal cord revealed the presence of degenerating fibers contralaterally in laminae IV–VII of the gray matter. Ipsilaterally, very sparse degeneration was evident in laminae VII and VIII of the gray matter. Two to six days after surgery, the electrically evoked, Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>‐dependent release of both D‐[<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]aspartate, a marker for glutamatergic/aspartatergic neurons, and γ‐amino[<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]‐butyric acid ([<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]GABA) was measured in dissected quadrants of the spinal cervical enlargement. Lesions centered on the red nucleus depressed the release of D‐[<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]aspartate by 25–45% in dorsal and ventral quadrants of the cervical enlargement contralaterally. The release of [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]GABA was depressed by 27% in contralateral ventral quadrants. To assess the contribution of rubro‐ versus reticulospinal fibers to the deficits in amino acid release, unilateral injections of kainic acid were placed stereotaxically in the midbrain reticular formation lateral to the red nucleus. Nissl‐stained sections through the midbrain revealed the presence of extensive neuronal loss in the midbrain and rostral pontine reticular formation, whereas neurons in the red nucleus remained undamaged. In the spinal cord, degenerating axons were present ipsilaterally in laminae VII and VIII of the gray matter. Some fiber degeneration was also evident contralaterally in laminae V and VI of the gray matter. This lesion did not affect the release of either D‐[<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]aspartate or [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]GABA in the spinal cord. The substantial decrements in D‐[<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]aspartate release following red nucleus lesions suggests that the synaptic endings of rubrospinal fibers mediate the release of D‐[<jats:sup>3H</jats:sup>]aspartate in the spinal cord. Therefore, these fibers may be glutamatergic and/or aspartatergic. Because other evidence suggests that rubrospinal neurons are probably not GABAergic, the depression of [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]GABA release probably reflects changes in the activity of spinal interneurons following the loss of rubrospinal input.</jats:p>",0

Sequential Development of Long-Term Potentiation and Depression in Different Layers of the Mouse Visual Cortex,"<jats:p>Visual deprivation affects the responses of layer IV cells more prominently during early postnatal development, whereas responses in layer II/III remain modifiable until later ages. We examined whether these laminar differences correlate with changes in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of the ascending pathways to layers IV and II/III in the mouse visual cortex. Our analysis revealed that LTP and LTD in layer IV principal cells is lost shortly after the eyes open, but persists in layers II/III beyond puberty. These results suggest that plasticity proceeds sequentially through cortical layers in a manner that parallels the flow of information during sensory processing.</jats:p>",0

Alterations in glutamate dehydrogenase of the brain of rats of various ages,"<jats:p> The activity of glutamate dehydrogenase of the brain of 6-, 22-, 52-, and 96-week-old rats was determined. The specific activity, units per milligram DNA and units per organ, increased with growth and was highest at 22 weeks. This was probably due to a higher rate of protein synthesis during growth since the total DNA content did not change during this period. The activity declined in old age. Some biogenic amines, endogenous to nervous tissue and possibly having neurotransmitter functions, such as 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT), acetylcholine (ACh), and norepinephrine (NEp), inhibited enzyme activity; epinephrine (Ep) stimulated enzyme activity at all ages. Studies on the effects of various concentrations of the transmitters showed that the concentrations of 5-HT, ACh, NEp, and Ep producing significant regulatory effects on the enzyme may be 0.048, 0.18, 0.05, and 0.025 mg/ml, respectively. </jats:p>",0

Effect of amiloride on sodium and water reabsorption in the rabbit gall‐bladder.,"<jats:p>The effects of the Na+‐channel‐blocking diuretic agent amiloride were assessed in the rabbit gall‐bladder epithelium, a low‐resistance epithelium with an isosmotic, coupled NaCl transport mechanism. Amiloride caused a rapid, reversible, and dose‐dependent decrease in fluid absorption when applied from the mucosal side in concentrations between 8.8 X 10(‐5) and 1.76 X 10(‐3) M. These concentrations were without effect from the serosal side, suggesting an action of amiloride in the luminal cell membrane as in high‐resistance epithelia. Amiloride did not affect the epithelial resistance or the passive serosa‐to‐mucosa Na+ flux, while net Na+ and water reabsorption were inhibited in parallel. Thus, amiloride did not affect the paracellular tight junction pathway, but inhibited a transcellular, coupled salt and water transport mechanism. The kinetics of the amiloride effect were of a Michaelis‐Menten type. The dose of amiloride giving 50% inhibition of fluid absorption (ID50) was 4 X 10(‐4) M, a value about three orders of magnitude higher than in high‐resistance, Na+‐retaining epithelia. The percentage inhibitory effect at each concentration of amiloride increased with increasing rate of spontaneous (control) fluid transport, reaching maximal responses fitting a Michaelis‐Menten kinetic with an ID50 of 1.5 X 10(‐4) M. No effects of changing the extracellular Na+ concentration between 51 and 145 mequiv/l on the maximal inhibitory effect of amiloride on Na+ and water reabsorption were observed. This suggests a non‐competitive type of action of amiloride on a Na+‐dependent isosmotic fluid transport mechanism. Removal of mucosal Ca2+ did not alter the effect of amiloride. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to concepts concerning the mechanism of isosmotic salt and water transport. The data are compatible with the concept that amiloride interferes with a Na+‐dependent formation and transcellular transport of isosmotic fluid volumes in a sequestered compartment in the epithelial cells.</jats:p>",0

The mechanism of disulphide reduction by mitochondria,"<jats:p>1. Cystamine was reduced to the corresponding thiol by rat liver mitochondria, even in the presence of rotenone or antimycin A. 2. The reduction of disulphides was stimulated by the accumulation of NADH or by the addition of NADH to osmotically ‘shocked’ mitochondria. 3. Energy made available by oxidative phosphorylation was not essential for the reduction of disulphides. 4. Cystamine was not reduced during the oxidation of NADH by ultrasonically treated particles, which had lost their capacity for oxidation of α-oxo acids. 5. In intact mitochondria, arsenite and other inhibitors of vicinal dithiols caused a decrease in the capacity for reduction of disulphides concomitantly with an inhibition of the oxidation of α-oxo acids. 6. Isolated lipoamide dehydrogenase reduced cystamine at the expense of NADH, provided that lipoic acid was also present. 7. It is concluded that in mitochondria the reduction of cystamine and related disulphides is probably brought about by interaction with reduced lipoic acid, generated by the α-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes during the oxidation of α-oxo acids or by reaction of lipoamide dehydrogenase with NADH.</jats:p>",0

Feline parvovirus propagates in cat bone marrow cultures and inhibits hematopoietic colony formation in vitro,"<jats:p>Feline parvovirus (FPV) causes leukopenia in naturally infected cats. We investigated the mechanism of hematopoietic depression by this virus in feline bone marrow cultured in vitro. In suspension cultures we demonstrated FPV propagation and replication using DNA molecular hybridization. Viral RNA and DNA were observed by in situ hybridization in about 10% of marrow cells at day 3. Granulocytes and their precursors were virtually absent from infected cultures after six days. Infected cells showed viral capsid protein predominantly in nuclei by immunofluorescence. In clonal assays, FPV most efficiently inhibited hematopoietic colony formation by myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM), but erythroid colony formation (BFU-E and CFU-E-derived) was also depressed in the presence of virus. Inhibition of colony formation could be abrogated by physical inactivation of the virus or preincubation with specific neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant human colony stimulating factors GM-CSF and G-CSF supported feline myelopoiesis in progenitor assays, and FPV completely inhibited factor dependent colony formation.</jats:p>",0

A spontaneous depressive pattern in adult female rhesus macaques,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Non-human primates offer unique opportunities to study the development of depression rooted in behavioral and physiological abnormalities. This study observed adult female rhesus macaques within social hierarchies and aimed to characterize the physiological and brain abnormalities accompanying depressive-like behavior. The behaviors of 31 female rhesus macaques from 14 different breeding groups were video recorded and the footage was analyzed using the focal animal technique. There were 13 monkeys who never displayed huddling behavior (non-huddlers). The remaining 18 monkeys were divided into two groups according the mean time spent in the huddle posture. Four monkeys were designated as high huddlers, whereas the other 14 monkeys were low huddlers. An inverse relationship was discovered between social rank and depression. High huddlers spent more time engaging in physical contact and in close proximity to other monkeys, as well as less time spontaneously and reactively locomoting, than low huddlers and/or non-huddlers. Cortisol levels measured from the hair were elevated significantly in high huddlers compared with low huddlers and non-huddlers and the measured cortisol levels were specifically higher in high huddlers than subordinate or dominant control monkeys. Regional cerebral blood flow data revealed significant and widespread decreases in high huddlers compared with non-huddlers.</jats:p>",0

Inhibition of microsomal lipid peroxidation by glutathione and glutathione transferases B and AA. Role of endogenous phospholipase A2,"<jats:p>Lipid peroxidation in vitro in rat liver microsomes (microsomal fractions) initiated by ADP-Fe3+ and NADPH was inhibited by the rat liver soluble supernatant fraction. When this fraction was subjected to frontal-elution chromatography, most, if not all, of its inhibitory activity could be accounted for by the combined effects of two fractions, one containing Se-dependent glutathione (GSH) peroxidase activity and the other the GSH transferases. In the latter fraction, GSH transferases B and AA, but not GSH transferases A and C, possessed inhibitory activity. GSH transferase B replaced the soluble supernatant fraction as an effective inhibitor of lipid peroxidation in vitro. If the microsomes were pretreated with the phospholipase A2 inhibitor p-bromophenacyl bromide, neither the soluble supernatant fraction nor GSH transferase B inhibited lipid peroxidation in vitro. Similarly, if all microsomal enzymes were heat-inactivated and lipid peroxidation was initiated with FeCl3/sodium ascorbate neither the soluble supernatant fraction nor GSH transferase B caused inhibition, but in both cases inhibition could be restored by the addition of porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 to the incubation. It is concluded that the inhibition of microsomal lipid peroxidation in vitro requires the consecutive action of phospholipase A2, which releases fatty acyl hydroperoxides from peroxidized phospholipids, and GSH peroxidases, which reduce them. The GSH peroxidases involved are the Se-dependent GSH peroxidase and the Se-independent GSH peroxidases GSH transferases B and AA.</jats:p>",0

</jats:list></jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Synaptic plasticity, a main substrate for learning and memory, is commonly assessed with prolonged stimulations. Since learning can arise from few or even a single trial, synaptic strength is expected to adapt rapidly. However, whether synaptic plasticity occurs in response to limited event occurrences remains elusive. To answer this question, we investigated whether a low number of paired stimulations can induce plasticity in a major synaptic learning rule, spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP). It is known that 100 pairings induce bidirectional STDP, i.e. spike‐timing‐dependent potentiation (tLTP) and depression (tLTD) at most central synapses. In rodent striatum, we found that tLTD progressively disappears when the number of paired stimulations is decreased (below 50 pairings) whereas tLTP displays a biphasic profile: tLTP is observed for 75–100 pairings, absent for 25–50 pairings and re‐emerges for 5–10 pairings. This tLTP, induced by very few pairings (∼5–10) depends on the endocannabinoid (eCB) system. This eCB‐dependent tLTP (eCB‐tLTP) involves postsynaptic endocannabinoid synthesis, requires paired activity (post‐ and presynaptic) and the activation of type‐1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) and transient receptor potential vanilloid type‐1 (TRPV1). eCB‐tLTP occurs in both striatopallidal and striatonigral medium‐sized spiny neurons (MSNs) and is dopamine dependent. Lastly, we show that eCB‐LTP and eCB‐LTD can be induced sequentially in the same neuron, depending on the cellular conditioning protocol. Thus, while endocannabinoids are usually thought simply to depress synaptic function, they also constitute a versatile system underlying bidirectional plasticity. Our results reveal a novel form of synaptic plasticity, eCB‐tLTP, which may underlie rapid learning capabilities characterizing behavioural flexibility.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Reactions of lateral geniculate cells to chemical and electrical excitation of the visual cortex in rabbits,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In anesthetized and paralyzed rabbits unitary discharges of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were studied after cortical excitation by strychnine and following electrical stimulation of the visual cortex (VC). Results showed that local application of strychnine produced a general increase of the spontaneous and evoked activity of geniculate cells. By contrast, cortical depression with KCl led to a differential decrement of one of the evoked responses (on or off). Electrical cortical stimulation paired with on or off stimuli led to a differential increment of on or off responses. The results support the notion that, in rabbits, the corticogeniculate system is center‐surround organized. A diagrammatic model is proposed to account for the relationship between the VC and the LGN in rabbits.</jats:p>",0

Heterosynaptic Plasticity Prevents Runaway Synaptic Dynamics,"<jats:p>Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and other conventional Hebbian-type plasticity rules are prone to produce runaway dynamics of synaptic weights. Once potentiated, a synapse would have higher probability to lead to spikes and thus to be further potentiated, but once depressed, a synapse would tend to be further depressed. The runaway synaptic dynamics can be prevented by precisely balancing STDP rules for potentiation and depression; however, experimental evidence shows a great variety of potentiation and depression windows and magnitudes. Here we show that modifications of synapses to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from rat visual and auditory cortices in slices can be induced by intracellular tetanization: bursts of postsynaptic spikes without presynaptic stimulation. Induction of these heterosynaptic changes depended on the rise of intracellular calcium, and their direction and magnitude correlated with initial state of release mechanisms. We suggest that this type of plasticity serves as a mechanism that stabilizes the distribution of synaptic weights and prevents their runaway dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we develop a cortical neuron model implementing both homosynaptic (STDP) and heterosynaptic plasticity with properties matching the experimental data. We find that heterosynaptic plasticity effectively prevented runaway dynamics for the tested range of STDP and input parameters. Synaptic weights, although shifted from the original, remained normally distributed and nonsaturated. Our study presents a biophysically constrained model of how the interaction of different forms of plasticity—Hebbian and heterosynaptic—may prevent runaway synaptic dynamics and keep synaptic weights unsaturated and thus capable of further plastic changes and formation of new memories.</jats:p>",0

Serotonin Depletion Leads to Cortical Hyperexcitability and Trigeminal Nociceptive Facilitation via the Nitric Oxide Pathway,"<jats:p>(<jats:italic>Headache</jats:italic> 2011;51:1152‐1160)</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Objective.—</jats:bold> To investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the development of cortical hyperexcitability and trigeminal nociceptive facilitation induced by serotonin (5‐HT) depletion.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Background.—</jats:bold> Nitric oxide and 5‐HT are important in the pathogenesis of primary headaches. An increase in cortical excitability and trigeminal nociception has been demonstrated in animals with low 5‐HT levels. Although the mechanism underlying this increase is unclear, an alteration of the NO system is one possible explanation.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods.—</jats:bold> Male Wistar rats were divided into control and 5‐HT‐depleted groups. 5‐HT was depleted by i.p. injection of parachlorophenylalanine (100 mg/kg). Three days after injection, a microelectrode was inserted into the cerebral cortex for electrocorticograph recording and waves of cortical spreading depression (CSD) were triggered with KCl application. N‐nitro‐L‐arginine methyl ester (L‐NAME; 10 mg/kg by i.v. injection) or saline was given after the second CSD wave. Following the experiment, the cerebral cortex and brain stem were removed for anti‐neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and anti‐Fos immunohistochemistry.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results.—</jats:bold> Relative to the control group, the 5‐HT‐depleted group exhibited a higher frequency of CSD waves, more nNOS‐immunoreactive cells in both the cerebral cortex and brainstem and more Fos‐immunoreactive cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). In the control group, L‐NAME application led to fewer nNOS‐immunoreactive cells in the cerebral cortex and TNC, and fewer Fos‐immunoreactive cells in the TNC; however, L‐NAME was without effect on the CSD pattern. By contrast, in addition to decreased nNOS and Fos expression, L‐NAME significantly reduced the frequency of CSD events in the 5‐HT‐depleted group.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions.—</jats:bold> Inhibition of NO production can counter both the cortical hyperexcitability and facilitation of trigeminal nociception that develop in the depleted 5‐HT state. Therefore, NO is likely involved in the increase in both CSD events and CSD‐evoked trigeminal nociception under decreased 5‐HT conditions.</jats:p>",0

Effect of Ethanol Dependence and Withdrawal on the Catecholamines in Rat Brain and Heart,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> To study whether ethanol dependence is accompanied by changes in the brain monoamines, male Sprague‐Dawley rats were intubated intragastrically with 10% (w/v) ethanol solution 3 times daily (daily dose 8–11 g/kg) for 7–10 days. Control rats were intubated with similar volumes of tap water. The rats were killed 4–6 hrs (intoxicated group) or 16–18 hrs (withdrawal group) after the last administration of ethanol. At this time the withdrawn rats showed a stiff tail, spastic rigidity, piloerection, tremor, hyperexcitability, stereotyped head movements as well as convulsions. The dopamine and homovanillic acid concentrations as well as the disappearance rate of dopamine after synthesis blockade (α‐methyl‐<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‐tyrosine 250 mg/kg intraperitoneally 3 hrs) were similar in the brain of control, ethanol intoxicated and withdrawn rats. Chronic ethanol administration did not alter the concentration of noradrenaline in the brain or the heart of the rats. However, the disappearance rate of noradrenaline after synthesis blockade was accelerated by about 30–50% in the brain and heart of rats withdrawn from ethanol. Moreover, the concentration of noradrenaline was decreased by 40–60% in the brain and heart of rats which died in withdrawal convulsions. The experiments suggest that the noradrenergic mechanisms but not the dopaminergic mechanisms may be associated with the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms.</jats:p>",0

Brain extracellular space during spreading depression and ischemia,"<jats:p>The change of extracellular space volume of rat brain cortex during ischemia and cortical spreading depression, CSD (Leāo4) was evaluated by a new method. The cortical surface was imgated with isotonic CSF containing the extracellular markers 50 mM cholin or 50 mM trimethyltris(hydroxymethyl)methyl ammonium ion (N‐TRIS), and their extracellular concentrations were monitored by ion‐selective microelectrodes. When steady‐state for the concentration of these markers was attained, CSD evoked a reversible increase of the concentration of the markers, indicating shrinkage of the interstitial volume of distribution. During ischemia an initial slow rate of concentration increase was observed, followed a few minutes later by a rapid increase concomitant with the sharp rise in extracellular potassium concentration. During CSD and ischemia, the maximal increases of choline and N‐TRIS concentration reflected a shrinkage of the extracellular space amounting to about 50% of the initial volume.</jats:p>",0

Activity-dependent potentiation and depression of visual cortical responses to optic nerve stimulation in kittens,"<jats:p> 1. To see whether long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy are induced in the developing visual cortex (VC), field potentials evoked by test stimulation given alternatively to each of the optic nerves (ONs) were recorded from VC of kittens ranging in age from 4 to 8 wk. In some experiments, field potentials were recorded simultaneously from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in addition to VC. 2. Tetanic stimulation was applied to one of the ONs for 1-60 min at 5 Hz. Homosynaptic potentiation of cortical responses, defined as an increase lasting &gt; 2.5 h in the cortical field potential evoked by test stimulation of the ON that was tetanized, was induced without any changes in LGN responses in 3 of the 12 kittens tested. Heterosynaptic depression, defined as a decrease lasting &gt; 0.5 h in the field potential evoked by stimulation of the ON that was not tetanized, was also induced in two of those three kittens. 3. To elucidate a role of inputs originating from spontaneous activity of retinal ganglion cells in induction of potentiation and depression in the cortex, tetrodotoxin (TTX) was injected into both eyes of 11 kittens. After we confirmed the suppression of retinal activity by TTX, tetanic stimulation was applied to ON. Homosynaptic potentiation of cortical responses was induced in 6 of the 11 kittens, and the ratio of the mean amplitude of posttetanic responses to that of pretetanic responses for the 11 kittens was on average larger than that for the 12 control kittens. Heterosynaptic depression was not observed in any of the 11 kittens. 4. To see a role of postsynaptic activity in induction of potentiation and depression, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was applied continuously to the VC by an infusion pump in 10 kittens. Tetanic stimulation was given to ON while cortical activities were suppressed by GABA. After recovery of cortical activities, homosynaptic depression was found to be induced in 3 of the 10 kittens, but homosynaptic potentiation was not observed at all. The ratio of amplitude of posttetanic to pretetanic responses at the tetanized side for the 10 kittens was on average smaller than that for the 11 TTX-injected kittens. 5. These results can be accounted for by the modified covariance model in which the relation of postsynaptic activity and direction of changes in synaptic efficacy is formulated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </jats:p>",0

Hydrocortisone requirement for the induction of glutamine synthetase in chick-embryo retinas,<jats:p>Hydrocortisone has been found to induce glutamine synthetase activity in chick-embryo retinas in culture. Evidence is presented to show that the hydrocortisone is definitely required for transcription; its requirement for translation has not been ruled out. The possible identity of hydrocortisone with an active component of calf-serum diffusate reported earlier is discussed. The data also indicate that the glutamine synthetase messenger RNA is stable for at least several hours.</jats:p>,0

Long-Term Depression at Parallel Fiber to Golgi Cell Synapses,"<jats:p> Golgi cells (GoCs) are the primary inhibitory interneurons of the granular layer of the cerebellum. Their inhibition of granule cells is central to operate the relay of excitatory inputs to the cerebellar cortex. Parallel fibers (PFs) establish synapses to the GoCs in the molecular layer; these synapses contain AMPA, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), and mostly group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. Long-term changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission at the PF-GoC synapse have not been described previously. We used whole cell patch-clamp recordings of GoCs in acute rat cerebellar slices to study synaptic plasticity. We report that high-frequency burst stimulation of PFs, using a current-clamp or voltage-clamp induction protocol, gave rise to long-term depression (LTD) at the PF-GoC synapse. This form of LTD was not associated with persistent changes of paired-pulse ratio, suggesting a postsynaptic origin. Furthermore, LTD induction was not dependent on activation of NMDA receptors. PF-GoC LTD does require activation of specifically group II metabotropic glutamate receptors and of protein kinase A. </jats:p>",0

New rules governing synaptic plasticity in core nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The nucleus accumbens is a forebrain region responsible for drug reward and goal‐directed behaviors. It has long been believed that drugs of abuse exert their addictive properties on behavior by altering the strength of synaptic communication over long periods of time. To date, attempts at understanding the relationship between drugs of abuse and synaptic plasticity have relied on the high‐frequency long‐term potentiation model of <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">T.V. B</jats:styled-content>liss &amp; <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">T</jats:styled-content>. <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">L</jats:styled-content>ømo [(1973) <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">J</jats:styled-content>ournal of <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">P</jats:styled-content>hysiology, 232, 331–356]. We examined synaptic plasticity using spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity, a stimulation paradigm that reflects more closely the <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> firing patterns of mouse core nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons and their afferents. In contrast to other brain regions, the same stimulation paradigm evoked bidirectional long‐term plasticity. The magnitude of spike‐timing‐dependent long‐term potentiation (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">tLTP</jats:styled-content>) changed with the delay between action potentials and excitatory post‐synaptic potentials, and frequency, whereas that of spike‐timing‐dependent long‐term depression (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">tLTD</jats:styled-content>) remained unchanged. We showed that <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">tLTP</jats:styled-content> depended on <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>‐methyl‐<jats:sc>d</jats:sc>‐aspartate receptors, whereas <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">tLTD</jats:styled-content> relied on action potentials. Importantly, the intracellular calcium signaling pathways mobilised during <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">tLTP</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">tLTD</jats:styled-content> were different. Thus, calcium‐induced calcium release underlies <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">tLTD</jats:styled-content> but not <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">tLTP</jats:styled-content>. Finally, we found that the firing pattern of a subset of medium spiny neurons was strongly inhibited by dopamine receptor agonists. Surprisingly, these neurons were exclusively associated with <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">tLTP</jats:styled-content> but not with <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">tLTD</jats:styled-content>. Taken together, these data point to the existence of two subgroups of medium spiny neurons with distinct properties, each displaying unique abilities to undergo synaptic plasticity.</jats:p>",0

"Involvement of melatonin and thyroid hormones in the control of sleep, food intake and energy metabolism in the domestic fowl.","<jats:p>Growing male domestic fowl of an egg‐laying strain were fed ad libitum and injected intraperitoneally with melatonin or intramuscularly with triiodothyronine (T3) to study the effects on sleep, food intake, blood glucose, e.e.g., oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Melatonin caused a dose‐related depression of food intake with sleep and aphagia lasting for 2 1/2 hr following 8 mg, drowsiness and greatly reduced intake following 4 and 2 mg and a slight reduction in food intake after 1 mg. T3 injection was followed by increased feeding within the range 50‐200 micrograms. The higher dose (200 micrograms) completely prevented the effects of 10 mg melatonin injected simultaneously. Melatonin (10 mg) depressed plasma glucose levels whereas T3 (200 micrograms) elevated blood glucose. Either darkness or melatonin (10 mg) caused an increase in amplitude and a decrease in frequency of the e.e.g. Birds fasted for 3 hr before injection showed significantly lower oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production when given melatonin (10 mg); T3 had no effect within the 4 hr period after injection and did not modify the effects of melatonin. It is postulated that the rapid effects of melatonin and T3 which were observed result from direct effects of these hormones on the central nervous system.</jats:p>",0

"Prey-capture in <i>Pomacanthus semicirculatus</i> (Teleostei,Pomacanthidae): functional implications of intramandibular joints in marine angelfishes","<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title>
               <jats:p>We examined prey-capture morphology and kinematics in the angelfish, Pomacanthus semicirculatus (Cuvier 1931), to evaluate the magnitude and role of functional specialisation. The feeding apparatus of P. semicirculatus possess three biomechanical mechanisms of particular interest: (1) a novel intramandibular joint, permitting dentary rotation and protruded jaw closure; (2) an opercular linkage facilitating mandible depression; and (3) a suspensorial linkage with two novel points of flexion,permitting anterior rotation of the suspensorium and augmenting mandible protrusion. Prey-capture kinematics were quantified using motion analysis of high-speed video, yielding performance profiles illustrating timing of onset,duration and magnitude of movement in these three biomechanical systems, and other variables traditionally quantified in studies of teleostean ram–suction feeding activity. Mandible depression and suspensorial rotation both augmented mandible protrusion, and coincided during jaw protrusion, typically increasing head length by 30%. Jaw closure appeared to result from contraction of the adductor mandibulae segment A2, which rotated the dentary by approximately 30° relative to the articular. This resulted in jaw closure with the mandible fully depressed and the jaws at peak-protrusion. Feeding events were concluded by a high-velocity jaw retraction (20–50 ms), and completed in 450–750 ms. Feeding kinematics and morphology of Pomacanthus differed from other biting teleosts, and more closely resemble some long-jawed ram–suction feeders. The structural and functional modifications in the Pomacanthusfeeding apparatus are matched to an unusual diet of structurally resilient and firmly attached benthic prey.</jats:p>",0

The Prospect of FKBP51 as a Drug Target,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is best known as an Hsp90‐associated co‐chaperone that regulates the responsiveness of steroid hormone receptors. In human genetic association studies, FKBP51 has repeatedly been associated with emotion processing and numerous stress‐related affective disorders. It has also been implicated in contributing to the glucocorticoid hyposensitivity observed in New World primates. More recently, several research groups have consistently shown a protective effect of FKBP51 knockout or knockdown on stress endocrinology and stress‐coping behavior in animal models of depression and anxiety. The principal druggability of FKBP51 is exemplified by the prototypic FKBP ligands FK506 and rapamycin. Moreover, FKBP51 is highly suited for X‐ray co‐crystallography, which should facilitate the rational drug design of improved FKBP51 ligands. In summary, FKBP51 has emerged as a promising new drug target for stress‐related disorders that should be amenable to drug discovery.</jats:p>",0

Differential electrocardiographic effects of myocardial ischemia induced by atrial pacing in dogs with various locations of coronary stenosis.,"<jats:p>The spatial distribution of abnormal repolarization potentials caused by regional myocardial ischemia was determined in 45 dogs. Ameroid constrictors were placed around the left circumflex artery in 10, the left anterior descending artery in 10, and the right coronary artery in 10. Ten dogs without constrictors served as controls. Electrocardiographic events were determined from body surface isopotential distributions, which were computed from potentials sensed by 84 torso electrodes. In control dogs, pacing to heart rates of 230 to 250 beats/min increased the intensity of positive and negative surface extrema during the ST segment without altering their spatial features. Two weeks after placement of the ameroid constrictors, tachycardia induced abnormal negative potentials during the ST segment. Localization of these ischemic forces varied with the placement of the constrictor in a manner consistent with the affected perfusion territories. However, much of the torso surface was involved by all lesions, and only small zones of ST segment depression unique to specific lesions could be identified. In five additional dogs a constrictor was placed on the right coronary artery 3 months after implantation of a device on the circumflex vessel. ST segment patterns during pacing in dogs with two lesions were consistent with the sum of the two individual lesions. Thus, the regional nature of myocardial ischemia is detectable in the body surface isopotential distributions, but the degree of spatial overlap may limit the value of such techniques in extending the usefulness of clinical exercise-stress electrocardiography.</jats:p>",0

Bidirectional changes in synapsin I phosphorylation at MAP kinase‐dependent sites by acute neuronal excitation <i>in vivo</i>,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Synapsin I is a synaptic vesicle‐associated protein which is phosphorylated at multiple sites by various kinases. It has been proposed to play a role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and the organization of cytoskeletal architecture in the presynaptic terminal. To better understand the physiological regulation of its phosphorylation <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>, we induced acute, reversible neuronal excitation by electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) in rats, and studied its effects on synapsin I phosphorylation at sites 3, 4/5 and 6 by immunoblot analyses of homogenates from hippocampus and parietal cortex using phospho‐site‐specific antibodies. A decrease in phosphorylation at all sites was observed soon after the electrical stimulation, followed by a large increase in phosphorylation at site 4/5 peaking at 5 min and a moderate increase in phosphorylation at site 6 peaking at 20 min. Systemic injection of SL327, a mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase inhibitor, prior to ECT, suppressed the increase in phospho‐site 4/5 level, as well as that in MAPK activity, but not that in phospho‐site 6 level. Thus, phosphorylation at site 4/5 of synapsin I has been shown to be regulated by MAPK <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0

Modeling Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity at the Calyx of Held Using In Vivo-Like Stimulation Patterns,"<jats:p> We measured synaptic responses to complex stimulus trains in the calyx of Held and used the data to test how well several vesicle-release models could capture the observed dynamics. We tested stimulation protocols consisting of Poisson-distributed activity with periodically changing mean frequencies, trains with constant inter spike intervals, and stimulus trains derived from in vivo responses to natural sounds. All stimuli were embedded in chronic background activity attempting to imitate the naturally occurring spontaneous activity in the auditory brain stem. We found that already the most basic model variant produced very good results, exhibiting very high correlation coefficients between the experimental data and the model predictions. None of the more complex model variants, which incorporated receptor desensitization, synaptic facilitation, and double-exponential recovery from depression, showed improved data-prediction matching accuracy. These findings are in contrast to previous modeling work performed in nonchronically active synapses, where the inclusion of additional physiological parameters into the modeling process tended to result in models with higher accuracy. Our findings suggest that the functional state of chronically active calyces may differ from the functional state of silent calyces and that this functional state of chronically active synapses can be described in relatively simple terms. </jats:p>",0

Combination Pharmacotherapy in Alcoholism: A Novel Treatment Approach,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Combination pharmacotherapy has proven effective in a number of psychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. However, compared with other affective disorders, few studies have explored the use of combination therapy in alcoholism, and the majority have been limited to animal models. There is evidence to support a role for combination therapy in alcoholism. For example, several neurochemical systems, including the dopaminergic, serotonergic, and opioidergic, appear to affect alcohol intake. Studies in several different types of alcohol-preferring rats have suggested that coadministration of agents to target more than one of these systems simultaneously may produce beneficial effects on alcohol intake, while avoiding problematic effects, such as alterations in food or water intake. Data from preliminary clinical studies have shown trends toward combination therapy reducing alcohol intake in humans. While such findings are encouraging, they must be explored further in larger, randomized, double-blind trials.</jats:p>",0

Role of AMPA receptor trafficking in NMDA receptor‐dependent synaptic plasticity in the rat lateral amygdala,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Stimulated exocytosis and endocytosis of post‐synaptic α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid subtype of glutamate receptors (AMPARs) have been proposed as primary mechanisms for the expression of hippocampal CA1 long‐term potentiation (LTP) and long‐term depression (LTD), respectively. LTP and LTD, the two most well characterized forms of synaptic plasticity, are thought to be important for learning and memory in behaving animals. Both LTP and LTD can also be induced in the lateral amygdala (LA), a critical structure involved in fear conditioning. However, the role of AMPAR trafficking in the expression of either LTP or LTD in this structure remains unclear. In this study, we show that NMDA receptor‐dependent LTP and LTD can be reliably induced at the synapses of the auditory thalamic inputs to the LA in brain slices. The expression of LTP was prevented by post‐synaptic blockade of vesicle‐mediated exocytosis with application of a light chain of <jats:italic>Clostridium tetanus</jats:italic> neurotoxin and was associated with increased cell‐surface AMPAR expression. In contrast, the expression of LTD was prevented by post‐synaptic application of a glutamate receptor 2‐derived interference peptide, which specifically blocks the stimulated clathrin‐dependent endocytosis of AMPARs, and was correlated with a reduction in plasma membrane‐surface expression of AMPARs. These results strongly suggest that regulated trafficking of post‐synaptic AMPARs is also involved in the expression of LTP and LTD in the LA.</jats:p>",0

Pairing-specific long-term depression of Purkinje cell excitatory postsynaptic potentials results from a classical conditioning procedure in the rabbit cerebellar slice,"<jats:p> 1. Using a rabbit cerebellar slice preparation, we stimulated a classical conditioning procedure by stimulating parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cells with the use of a brief, high-frequency train of eight constant-current pulses 80 ms before climbing fiber inputs to the same Purkinje cell were stimulated with the use of a brief, lower frequency train of three constant-current pulses. In all experiments, we assessed the effects of stimulation by measuring the peak amplitude of Purkinje cell excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to single parallel fiber test pulses. 2. Intradendritically recorded Purkinje cell EPSPs underwent a long-term (&gt; 20 min) reduction in peak amplitude (30%) after paired stimulation of the parallel and climbing fibers but not after unpaired or parallel fiber alone stimulation. We call this phenomenon pairing-specific long-term depression (PSD). 3. Facilitation of the peak amplitude of a second EPSP elicited by a parallel fiber train occurred both before and after paired stimulation suggesting that the locus of depression was not presynaptic. Depression of the peak amplitude of a depolarizing response to focal application of glutamate following pairings of parallel and climbing fiber stimulation added support to a suggested postsynaptic locus of the PSD effect. 4. The application of aniracetam potentiated EPSP peak amplitude by 40%, but these values returned to baseline as a result of pairings. With the removal of aniracetam from the bath 20 min after pairings, normal levels of pairing-specific EPSP depression were observed, indicating that the effect did not result from direct desensitization of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptors. 5. Incubation of slices in the protein kinase inhibitor H-7 potentiated EPSP peak amplitudes slightly (9%), but peak amplitudes returned to baseline levels after pairings. The net reduction in EPSP peak amplitude of &lt; 10% after pairings suggested that H-7 partially blocked PSD and that, in turn, PSD involved protein kinases. 6. The means of induction and the specificity of those means suggest that the phenomenology of PSD is fundamentally different from that of long-term depression. PSD only occurs with pairings of trains of parallel fiber and climbing fiber stimulation; it occurs without the need for bicuculline; and it can overcome the blocking effects of aniracetam. 7. Nevertheless, the involvement of protein kinases and the potential role of calcium suggest that the mechanisms involved in the induction of PSD and long-term depression have a number of features in common. 8. Because of the pairing-specific nature of the long-term synaptic depression observed in these experiments, PSD provides a mechanism that may contribute to the role of the cerebellar cortex in classical conditioning. </jats:p>",0

Serotonin Induces Long-Term Depression at Corticostriatal Synapses,"<jats:p>The striatum has important roles in motor control and action learning and, like many brain regions, receives multiple monoaminergic inputs. We have examined serotonergic modulation of rat and mouse corticostriatal neurotransmission and find that serotonin (5-HT) activates 5-HT<jats:sub>1b</jats:sub>receptors resulting in a long-term depression (LTD) of glutamate release and striatal output that we have termed 5-HT–LTD. 5-HT–LTD is presynaptically mediated, cAMP pathway dependent, and inducible by endogenous striatal 5-HT, as revealed by application of a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor. 5-HT–LTD is mutually occlusive with dopamine/endocannabinoid-dependent LTD, suggesting that these two forms of LTD act on the same corticostriatal terminals. Thus, serotonergic and dopaminergic mechanisms exist that may interact to persistently sculpt corticostriatal circuits, potentially influencing action learning and striatal-based disorders.</jats:p>",0

Effects of Antihypertensive Medication on the Cardiovascular Response to Ketamine in Rats,"<jats:p>The effects of hydralazine, clonidine, propranolol and methyldopa medications on the cardiovascular response to ketamine anaesthesia were studied in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. Except in propranolol‐ and methyldopa‐treated animals, blood pressure was increased by ketamine in all groups. The heart rate was increased only in the normotensive control rats, whereas it was reduced in both the unmedicated and all of the medicated SH rats. Plasma renin activity under ketamine anaesthesia was markedly higher in normotensive control rats than in any of the SH groups. The pressor responses to dopamine and metaraminol were not altered by propranolol medication, but hydralazine suppressed these responses, while they were markedly intensified by clonidine and methyldopa treatment. Similarly, small additional doses of ketamine caused a pressor response only in clonidine‐ and methyldopa‐treated animals, whereas in the other groups the response was depressive. The tolerance to haemorrhagic shock during ketamine anaesthesia was notably improved by hydralazine and methyldopa medication, but impaired by propranolol treatment.</jats:p><jats:p>The results suggest that, with special reference to shock tolerance, hydralazine and methyldopa, and to a lesser extent also clonidine, have a favourable effect on the circulation under ketamine anaesthesia, whereas the action of beta‐blockade may be harmful.</jats:p>",0
Melatonin synergizes with citalopram to induce antidepressant‐like behavior and to promote hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is affected in some neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. Numerous evidence indicates that plasma levels of melatonin are decreased in depressed patients. Also, melatonin exerts positive effects on the hippocampal neurogenic process and on depressive‐like behavior. In addition, antidepressants revert alterations of hippocampal neurogenesis present in models of depression following a similar time course to the improvement of behavior. In this study, we analyzed the effects of both, citalopram, a widely used antidepressant, and melatonin in the Porsolt forced swim test. In addition, we investigated the potential antidepressant role of the combination of melatonin and citalopram (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MLTCITAL</jats:styled-content>), its type of pharmacological interaction on depressive behavior, and its effect on hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we found decreased immobility behavior in mice treated with melatonin (&lt;14–33%) and citalopram (&lt;17–30%). Additionally, the <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MLTCITAL</jats:styled-content> combination also decreased immobility (&lt;22–35%) in comparison with control mice, reflecting an antidepressant‐like effect after 14 days of treatment. Moreover, <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MLTCITAL</jats:styled-content> decreased plasma corticosterone levels (≤13%) and increased cell proliferation (&gt;29%), survival (&gt;39%), and the absolute number of ‐associated new neurons (&gt;53%) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These results indicate that the <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MLTCITAL</jats:styled-content> combination exerts synergism to induce an antidepressant‐like action that could be related to the modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. This outcome opens the opportunity of using melatonin to promote behavioral benefits and hippocampal neurogenesis in depression and also supports the use of the <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">MLTCITAL</jats:styled-content> combination as an alternative to treat depression.</jats:p>",1

Electroconvulsive Shock Increases Tyrosine Hydroxylase Activity in the Brain and Adrenal Gland of the Rat,"<jats:p>A single application of electroconvulsive shock produced a rapid but short-lasting increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity above control values in the rat adrenal medulla and striatum. After repeated electroconvulsive shock treatment (once per day for 7 days), tyrosine hydroxylase activity increased significantly in the locus ceruleus, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, hippocampus, cerebellum, and frontal cortex and remained elevated for 4 to 8 days. Adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase activity increased 1 day after the termination of repeated electroconvulsive shock treatments and remained elevated for at least 24 days, possibly reflecting the establishment of a new and higher steady-state level of catecholamine biosynthesis in the adrenal. These findings suggest that the persistent changes in tyrosine hydroxylase activity produced by repeated electroconvulsive shock may be a factor contributing to the long-lasting antidepressant effects of this treatment.</jats:p>",0

Frequency‐dependent recruitment of inhibition mediated by stellate cells in the rat cerebellar cortex,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the cerebellum, dendritic inhibition of Purkinje cells (PCs) is mediated by stellate cells (SCs). These inhibitory interneurons are critically involved in the cerebellar network; they control the timing and firing frequency of PCs, the only output cells of the cerebellar cortex. However, the underlying properties of parallel fiber (PF) to SC excitatory synapses have not been fully determined. To characterize the conditions favoring the recruitment of SCs in the cerebellum, we analyzed evoked and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded from SCs of rat cerebellar slices. We found that SC EPSCs evoked with single suprathreshold‐intensity stimulations were mostly unitary, with a large amplitude and variable latencies, and failed with a high rate. Increasing the frequency of stimulation above 60 Hz significantly reduced failures, whereas mean SC EPSC amplitude was increased by less than 20%. Decreasing failures at PF‐SC synapses experimentally enhanced the number of asynchronous SC EPSCs per stimulation but, again, moderately increased the mean SC EPSC amplitude. Finally, brief presynaptic bursts transiently depressed synaptic transmission. This depression resulted from the release of endocannabinoids and might act as a negative‐feedback mechanism. Thus, we conclude that SC EPSCs evoked with single suprathreshold‐intensity stimulations are mostly unitary and that PF‐SC synapse efficacy is highly regulated by the presynaptic temporal pattern of activity and the frequency of afferent inputs. Such synaptic properties may control the responsiveness of SC synapses to the frequency of PF stimulations, which may control the spatial extent and duration of the recruitment of inhibition in the cerebellar cortex. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",0
Calcium Time Course as a Signal for Spike-Timing–Dependent Plasticity,"<jats:p> Calcium has been proposed as a postsynaptic signal underlying synaptic spike-timing–dependent plasticity (STDP). We examine this hypothesis with computational modeling based on experimental results from hippocampal cultures, some of which are presented here, in which pairs and triplets of pre- and postsynaptic spikes induce potentiation and depression in a temporally asymmetric way. Specifically, we present a set of model biochemical detectors, based on plausible molecular pathways, which make direct use of the time course of the calcium signal to reproduce these experimental STDP results. Our model features a modular structure, in which long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) components compete to determine final plasticity outcomes; one aspect of this competition is a veto through which appropriate calcium time courses suppress LTD. Simulations of our model are also shown to be consistent with classical LTP and LTD induced by several presynaptic stimulation paradigms. Overall, our results provide computational evidence that, while the postsynaptic calcium time course contains sufficient information to distinguish various experimental long-term plasticity paradigms, small changes in the properties of back-propagation of action potentials or in synaptic dynamics can alter the calcium time course in ways that will significantly affect STDP induction by any detector based exclusively on postsynaptic calcium. This may account for the variability of STDP outcomes seen within hippocampal cultures, under repeated application of a single experimental protocol, as well as for that seen in multiple spike experiments across different systems. </jats:p>",0

Decrease of the platelet 5‐HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor function by long‐term imipramine treatment in endogenous depression,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Background</jats:title><jats:p>Animal studies have found that many antidepressants induce decreases in both the density and the functional activity of the serotonin 2A (5‐HT<jats:sub>2A</jats:sub>) receptor subtype.

"Coping with Chronic Social Stress in Mice: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal/ Sympathetic-Adrenal-Medullary Axis Activity, Behavioral Changes and Effects of Antalarmin Treatment: Implications for the Study of Stress-Related Psychopathologies","<jats:p>The aim of this study was to analyze the individual differences that lead to the development of psychopathological changes in response to chronic social stress. We also assessed the ability of an antagonist of the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptors to reverse the effects of stress. Male adult mice were exposed to repeated defeat experiences for 21 days using a sensorial contact model. After 18 days of defeat, two groups of subjects were established (active and passive), according to their behaviors during social confrontation. Antalarmin treatment was given for 4 and 6 days. The results corroborated previous data indicating that subjects who adopted a passive coping strategy had higher corticosterone levels after 21 days of defeat and decreased resting levels 3 days later. Moreover, they showed higher resting expression levels of hypothalamic CRH than their active counterparts. On day 24, the experimental animals were subjected to another social defeat to determine whether the stress response remained. The increase in corticosterone and hypothalamic CRH levels was similar for all of the stressed subjects, but the passive subjects also had a greater CRH response in the amygdala. Passive subjects had decreased levels of adrenal dopamine β-hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase and plasma adrenaline compared to the active subjects, and lower plasma noradrenaline levels than manipulated controls. The passive profile of physiological changes in both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axes has been associated with changes related to mood disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. The active coping profile is characterized by similar corticosterone resting levels to controls and increased SAM activity. Both profiles showed alterations in the novel palatable and forced swimming tests, with the passive profile being the most vulnerable to the effects of stress in this last test. Pharmacological treatment with antalarmin failed to reverse the effects of stress.</jats:p>",1

Chronic fluoxetine treatment upregulates 5‐HT uptake sites and 5‐HT<sub>2</sub> receptors in rat brain: An autoradiographic study,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of chronic treatment with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor used widely in the treatment of depression, on the distribution and density of 5‐HT uptake sites, 5‐HT<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> receptors, and vesicular amine uptake sites in rat brain. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i. p.) was administered daily for 21 days. The density of 5‐HT uptake sites labelled by [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]paroxetine, 5‐HT<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> receptors labelled by [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]ketanserin in presence of tetrabenazine and vesicular amine uptake sites labelled by [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]ketanserin in the presence of mianserin were measured by quantitative autoradiography in 22 areas of rat brain, using coronal tissue sections. Chronic administration of fluoxetine produced significant increases in the density of 5‐HT uptake sites in layers of frontoparietal cortex (by 32–43%), of striate cortex (by 55%), in CA1 field of hippocampus (by 111%) and in superior colliculus (by 20%). Fluoxetine treatment also resulted in upregulation of 5‐HT<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> receptors in layers of frontparietal cortex (31–38%) and in CA2‐3 fields of hippocampus (by 39%). The density of tetrabenazine‐sensitive vesicular amine uptake sites in the caudate‐putamen was also significantly increased (by 66%). The observed alterations in 5‐HT uptake site and 5‐HT<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> receptor densities are likely a part of adaptive neuronal changes that occur after chronic administration of fluoxetine and may be related to the antidepressant effect of the drug. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",0

Reduced 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>- and GABA<sub>B</sub>Receptor Function in Dorsal Raphé Neurons Upon Chronic Fluoxetine Treatment of Socially Stressed Rats,"<jats:p>Autoinhibitory serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>) in dorsal raphé nucleus (DRN) have been implicated in chronic depression and in actions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Due to experimental limitations, it was never studied at single-cell level whether changes in 5-HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>receptor functionality occur in depression and during SSRI treatment. Here we address this question in a social stress paradigm in rats that mimics anhedonia, a core symptom of depression. We used whole cell patch-clamp recordings of 5-HT- and baclophen-induced G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) currents as a measure of 5-HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>- and GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>receptor functionality. 5-HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>- and GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>receptor-mediated GIRK-currents were not affected in socially stressed rats, suggesting that there was no abnormal (auto)inhibition in the DRN on social stress. However, chronic fluoxetine treatment of socially stressed rats restored anticipatory behavior and reduced the responsiveness of 5-HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>receptor-mediated GIRK currents. Because GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>receptor-induced GIRK responses were also suppressed, fluoxetine does not appear to desensitize 5-HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>receptors but rather one of the downstream components shared with GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>receptors. This fluoxetine effect on GIRK currents was also present in healthy animals and was independent of the animal's “depressed” state. Thus our data show that symptoms of depression after social stress are not paralleled by changes in 5-HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>receptor signaling in DRN neurons, but SSRI treatment can alleviate these behavioral symptoms while acting strongly on the 5-HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>receptor signaling pathway.</jats:p>",1

Precisely Localized LTD in the Neocortex Revealed by Infrared-Guided Laser Stimulation,"<jats:p>In a direct approach to elucidate the origin of long-term depression (LTD), glutamate was applied onto dendrites of neurons in rat neocortical slices. An infrared-guided laser stimulation was used to release glutamate from caged glutamate in the focal spot of an ultraviolet laser. A burst of light flashes caused an LTD-like depression of glutamate receptor responses, which was highly confined to the region of “tetanic” stimulation (&lt;10 micrometers). A similar depression of glutamate receptor responses was observed during LTD of synaptic transmission. A spatially highly specific postsynaptic mechanism can account for the LTD induced by glutamate release.</jats:p>",0

Continuous pulmonary C-fiber stimulation produces sustained reflex cardiovascular depression,"<jats:p> We used an isolated perfused in situ left lung preparation to evaluate the hemodynamic response to specific pulmonary C-fiber stimulation with capsaicin in two groups of anesthetized dogs. In one group (n = 6), continuous administration of capsaicin at 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 into the isolated pulmonary circulation produced sustained (20 min) reflex decreases in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, maximal left ventricular rate of pressure over time, and heart rate. These effects were abolished by vagotomy. In a second group (n = 5) of atropinized dogs, a mild hemorrhage was first performed in each dog during control conditions (capsaicin vehicle administration). The hemorrhage was performed by removing 10% of blood volume over 3 min and then replacing this blood 3 min later. After reinfusion and stabilization, the mild hemorrhage was repeated during continuous administration of capsaicin (6.0 +/- 1.0 microgram.kg-1.min-1) into the isolated pulmonary circulation. The decrease of mean arterial pressure in response to hemorrhage was significantly greater during capsaicin administration than during control conditions. Lung denervation prevented the effect of capsaicin administration on the response to hemorrhage. We concluded that continuous pulmonary C-fiber stimulation produces sustained cardiovascular depression and compromises the hemodynamic response to mild hemorrhage in dogs. This latter effect may represent a central alteration of baroreflex gain. </jats:p>",0

A gamma‐aminobutyric‐acid‐mediated inhibition of neurones in the nucleus tractus solitarius of the cat.,<jats:p>1. Extracellular recordings were made from 123 synaptically activated neurones in the nucleus tractus solitarius of the chloralose‐anaesthetized cat. 2. Ninety‐one neurones were activated by electrical stimulation of cardiac or pulmonary vagal branches and thirty‐two by stimulation of the aortic nerve. 3. Ionophoretic application of GABA abolished or markedly reduced the evoked or spontaneous activity of each neurone tested. These inhibitory effects were antagonized by the simultaneous ionophoretic application of bicuculline. 4. Glycine inhibited the evoked activity of 60% of neurones tested. This inhibition could be antagonized by the simultaneous application of strychnine. 5. Application of bicuculline alone increased the evoked or spontaneous activity of a large proportion of the neurones; strychnine alone had no significant effect on the evoked or spontaneous activity of the neurones. 6. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that GABA acts as an inhibitory transmitter substance within the nucleus tractus solitarius.</jats:p>,0

Individual Cerebellar Purkinje Cells Express Different cGMP Phosphodiesterases (PDEs):<i>In Vivo</i>Phosphorylation of cGMP-Specific PDE (PDE5) as an Indicator of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) Activation,"<jats:p>The nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway has been implicated as playing a crucial role in the induction of cerebellar long-term depression (LTD). The amplitude and duration of the cGMP signal is controlled by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Here we identify PDE5 and PDE1B as the two major cGMP-hydrolyzing PDEs specifically and differentially expressed in the Purkinje neurons of mouse cerebellum. PDE5 was found in all Purkinje neurons, whereas PDE1B was detected only in a subset of these cells, suggesting that individual Purkinje cells may differentially regulate cGMP, depending on the PDE isozymes expressed.</jats:p><jats:p>Although expression of guanylate cyclase and/or cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in Purkinje cells have been reported, neither cGMP accumulation nor PKG activation in these cells<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>has been demonstrated. To determine if changes in PKG activation and PDE5 regulation occur<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>we have examined the phosphorylation of PDE5 in mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analyses using a phosphospecific PDE5 antibody. Injection of sodium nitroprusside or selective PKG activators into the lateral ventricle of mouse brain induced PDE5 phosphorylation<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>, but was completely missing in Purkinje cell-specific PKG I knock-out mice. In cerebellar slices, treatment with sildenafil or IBMX led to different levels of phospho-PDE5 accumulation and activation of PDE5. These results suggest that phosphorylation of PDE5 in Purkinje neurons after cGMP-PKG activation performs a critical role in the termination of the cGMP signal during LTD progression; moreover, PDE5 phosphorylation may be used as an<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>indicator for PKG activation.</jats:p>",0

Population genetics after fragmentation: the case of the endangered Spanish imperial eagle (<i>Aquila adalberti</i>),"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The highly endangered Spanish imperial eagle,<jats:italic>Aquila adalberti</jats:italic>, has suffered from both population decline and fragmentation during the last century. Here we describe the current genetic status of the population using an extensive sampling of its current distribution range and both mitochondrial control region sequences and nuclear microsatellite markers. Results were evaluated in comparison to those obtained for the Eastern imperial eagle,<jats:italic>Aquila heliaca</jats:italic>, its nearest extant relative. Mitochondrial haplotype diversity was lower in the Spanish than in the Eastern species whereas microsatellite allelic richness and expected heterozygosity did not differ. Both allelic richness and expected heterozygosity were lower in the small Parque Nacional de Doñana breeding nucleus compared to the remaining nuclei. A signal for a recent genetic bottleneck was not detected in the current Spanish imperial eagle population. We obtained low but significant pairwise<jats:italic>F</jats:italic><jats:sub>ST</jats:sub>values that were congruent with a model of isolation by distance.<jats:italic>F</jats:italic><jats:sub>ST</jats:sub>and exact tests showed differentiation among the peripheral and small Parque Nacional de Doñana population and the remaining breeding subgroups. The centrally located Montes de Toledo population did not differ from the surrounding Centro, Extremadura and Sierra Morena populations whereas the latter were significantly differentiated. On the other hand, a Bayesian approach identified two groups, Parque Nacional de Doñana and the rest of breeding nuclei. Recent migration rates into and from Parque Nacional de Doñana and the rest of breeding nuclei were detected by assignment methods and estimated as 2.4 and 5.7 individuals per generation, respectively, by a Bayesian approach. We discuss how management strategies should aim at the maintenance of current genetic variability levels and the avoidance of inbreeding depression through the connection of the different nuclei.</jats:p>",0

"CyPPA, a positive modulator of small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, inhibits phasic uterine contractions and delays preterm birth in mice","<jats:p> Organized uterine contractions, including those necessary for parturition, are dependent on calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels in myometrial smooth muscle cells. Recent evidence suggests that small-conductance Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>-activated potassium channels (K<jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>2), specifically isoforms K<jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>2.2 and 2.3, may control these contractions through negative feedback regulation of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> entry. We tested whether selective pharmacologic activation of K<jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>2.2/2.3 channels might depress uterine contractions, providing a new strategy for preterm labor intervention. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed expression of both K<jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>2.2 and K<jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>2.3 in the myometrium of nonpregnant (NP) and pregnant (gestation day 10 and 16; D10 and D16, respectively) mice. Spontaneous phasic contractions of isolated NP, D10, and D16 uterine strips were all suppressed by the K<jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>2.2/2.3-selective activator CyPPA in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was antagonized by the selective K<jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>2 inhibitor apamin. Whereas CyPPA sensitivity was reduced in D10 and D16 versus NP strips (pIC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> 5.33 ± 0.09, 4.64 ± 0.03, 4.72 ± 0.10, respectively), all contractions were abolished between 30 and 60 μM. Blunted contractions were associated with CyPPA depression of spontaneous Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> events in myometrial smooth muscle bundles. Augmentation of uterine contractions with oxytocin or prostaglandin F<jats:sub>2α</jats:sub> did not reduce CyPPA sensitivity or efficacy. Finally, in an RU486-induced preterm labor model, CyPPA significantly delayed time to delivery by 3.4 h and caused a 2.5-fold increase in pup retention. These data indicate that pharmacologic stimulation of myometrial K<jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>2.2/2.3 channels effectively suppresses Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>-mediated uterine contractions and delays preterm birth in mice, supporting the potential utility of this approach in tocolytic therapies. </jats:p>",0

A one‐year‐old, male, mixed‐breed dog was presented with fever, depression and persistent cough of one month’s duration. Clinical examination revealed temperature of 39·5°C, loud bronchovesicular sounds on thoracic auscultation and attenuated cardiac sounds. Thoracic radiographs showed a moderate bilateral pleural effusion and a diffuse interstitial pulmonary pattern, with an alveolar pattern in one lobe. Routine haematology revealed anaemia and leucocytosis with eosinophilia, basophilia and thrombocytopenia. Coagulation assays showed a consumptive coagulopathy resembling disseminated intravascular coagulation. The relationship between haemothorax and the presence of <jats:italic>A vasorum </jats:italic>larvae in the pleural effusion is discussed.

Target‐cell‐specific bidirectional synaptic plasticity at hippocampal output synapses,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>It is commonly accepted that the hippocampus is critically involved in the explicit memory formation of mammals. The subiculum is the principal target of CA1 pyramidal cells and thus serves as the major relay station for the outgoing hippocampal information. Pyramidal cells in the subiculum can be classified according to their firing properties into burst‐spiking and regular‐spiking cells. In the present study we demonstrate that burst‐spiking and regular‐spiking cells show fundamentally different forms of low frequency‐induced synaptic plasticity in rats. In burst‐spiking cells, low‐frequency stimulation (at 0.5–5 Hz) induces frequency‐dependent long‐term depression (LTD) with a maximum at 1 Hz. This LTD is dependent on the activation of NMDAR and masks an mGluR‐dependent long‐term potentiation (LTP). In contrast, in regular‐spiking cells low‐frequency stimulation induces an mGluR‐dependent LTP that masks an NMDAR‐dependent LTD. Both processes depend on postsynaptic Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>‐signaling as BAPTA prevents the induction of synaptic plasticity in both cell types. Thus, mGluR‐dependent LTP and NMDAR‐dependent LTD occur simultaneously at CA1‐subiculum synapses and the predominant direction of synaptic plasticity relies on the cell type investigated. Our data indicate a novel mechanism for the sliding‐threshold model of synaptic plasticity, in which induction of LTP and LTD seems to be driven by the relative activation state of NMDAR and mGluR. Our observation that the direction of synaptic plasticity correlates with the discharge properties of the postsynaptic cell reveals a novel and intriguing mechanism of target specificity that may serve in tuning the significance of neuronal information by trafficking hippocampal output onto either subicular burst‐spiking or regular‐spiking cells.</jats:p>",0

"Signals causing change in morphological phenotype, growth mode, and gene expression of vascular endothelial cells","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Comparison of three different lines of bovine aortal endothelial cells provides a clear demonstration of reversible morphologic phenotype coincidental with change in expression and growth mode. These phenotypic forms can be externally controlled so that cells may exist either in an epithelioid contact‐inhibitable state or as a fibroblastoid non‐contact‐inhibitable state.</jats:p><jats:p>Clonal cell line N (normal) shows a strong tendency to maintain the epithelioid phenotype. Clonal cell line Sp (sprout) can readily and reversibly adopt the epithelioid or fibroblastoid phenotype. A factor in normal serum is responsible for maintaining the cells in the epithelioid phenotype. This factor could be a growth factor since several polypeptide growth factors are shown to drive cells from the fibroblastoid phenotype to the epithelioid phenotype within 11 hours. This growth factor‐induced change is not mediated through induced DNA synthesis. Clonal cell line V (variant) normally maintains the fibroblastoid phenotype but can be directed to the epithelioid phenotype provided cells are on an appropriate collagenous matrix.</jats:p><jats:p>Associated with these changes in morphological phenotype are depression of the expression of the pro α<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> chain of collagen type I which may be characteristic of the contact‐inhibited state and of an 80,000 mol wt polypeptide synthesized only by cells in the fibroblastoid phenotype. An endothelial cell collagen ECl (mol wt 177,000) was synthesized by all cell lines regardless of phenotype whereas a suspected breakdown product EC3 (mol wt 100,000) was found only in the epithelioid phenotype. Other differences and similarities between cell lines include expression of a 135,000 mol wt glycoprotein GP (V and N), the procollagen of collagen type III (N) of fibronectin (N, V, Sp), and of the pro α<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> chain of collagen type I (Sp, V). The characteristic expression of each line and its response to signals controlling morphologic phenotype impinges on the question of whether there exist several distinct types of vascular endothelial cells with different functional potentials controlled by extracellular signals.</jats:p>",0

Renomedullary and intestinal hyaluronan content during body water excess: a study in rats and gerbils,"<jats:p>Our previous studies in rats have suggested a role for renomedullary hyaluronan (HA) in water homeostasis. The gerbil is known for its unique ability to conserve water. In the present study renal papillary and intestinal HA were compared between groups of anaesthetized gerbils and rats before and after up to 6 h of <jats:sc>i.v.</jats:sc> water loading. Baseline papillary HA in gerbils was only 37 % of that in the rat. Water loading in rats increased the papillary HA content. Elevation was maximal (+27 %, <jats:styled-content><jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05</jats:styled-content>) after 2 h of water loading and then declined to control levels after 6 h of water loading (+3 %, n.s.). In contrast, the gerbil responded with a decreased papillary HA content during water loading. The depression was maximal after 2 h (‐49 %, <jats:styled-content><jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05</jats:styled-content>) and was still 41 % below the control values after 6 h (<jats:styled-content><jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05</jats:styled-content>). The urine flow rate increased rapidly in the rat and its maximum, 21 times above the control level (<jats:styled-content><jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05</jats:styled-content>), occurred at the HA peak, i.e. after 2 h of water loading while in the gerbil, the urine flow rate increased slowly and slightly and was only six times above control values after 6 h of water loading (<jats:styled-content><jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05</jats:styled-content>). The HA content along the intestine was similar in the two species: lowest in the duodenum and jejunum and highest in the distal colon. To conclude, in the rat, the elevation of papillary interstitial HA during acute water loading would counteract water reabsorption by changing the physico‐chemical characteristics of the interstitial matrix favouring rapid water diuresis. This would work as a complement to the powerful regulation by ADH. The gerbil has a diametrically different regulation of papillary HA turnover during water loading. The decreased papillary HA level during water loading and the slow and small diuretic response may represent a genetic difference in adaptation to enhance the ability to conserve water in an arid environment.</jats:p>",0

Elevated diaphragm electromyogram during neonatal hypoxic ventilatory depression,"<jats:p> Diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) was obtained in eight 48-h-old unanesthetized monkeys while breathing air and then either of two different hypoxic gas mixtures (12 or 8% O2 in N2) for 5 min. Minute ventilation (VI) rose significantly above control levels by 1 min of hypoxemia while animals were breathing either of the hypoxic gas mixtures as tidal volume (VT) and slope and rate moving average EMG increased. The relative gains in VI were associated with comparable increases in diaphragmatic neural activity per minute (EMG/min = peak EMG X frequency) during this early phase of hypoxemia. VI subsequently fell to control levels (inspired O2 fraction = 12%, arterial PO2 = 23 +/- 3 Torr) or significantly below (inspired O2 fraction = 8%, arterial PO2 = 18 +/- 0.4 Torr) by 5 min of hypoxemia, secondary to changes in VT. Despite the decline in VI, slope and rate moving average EMG, and EMG/min remained statistically above control values by 5 min of hypoxemia, although there was a trend for EMG/min to decrease slightly from the 1-min peak response. These findings demonstrate that hypoxic-induced depression of neural input to the diaphragm is not independently responsible for the biphasic nature of the newborn ventilatory response, although it cannot be ruled out as a contributor. The fall in inspiratory volumes despite constant elevated EMG activity suggests the presence of a change in respiratory mechanics and/or an impairment in diaphragmatic contractile function without offsetting neural compensatory activity. </jats:p>",0

Antioxidant Enzyme Activities and Malondialdehyde Levels in Patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"<jats:p>To examine the importance of free radicals in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), we aimed to evaluate whether malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT)] activity levels were associated with OCD. The patients were divided into two subgroups according to whether DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) was accompanied (OCD + MDD) or not (OCD – MDD). The MDA and antioxidant enzyme levels both in patients and controls were determined. SOD activity levels were significantly higher in the OCD + MDD group compared with the control and the OCD – MDD group. Although the OCD – MDD group had slightly higher SOD activity levels as compared with the controls, the difference was not statistically significant. GSH-Px activity levels were statistically significantly higher in both groups compared with controls. Likewise, there was a significant difference in GSH-Px activity levels between the OCD + MDD and OCD – MDD group. CAT activity levels were slightly higher in the OCD + MDD group compared with the OCD – MDD and control group. MDA levels in both groups were significantly higher than in controls. In addition, the difference in MDA levels between both groups was statistically significant. In conclusion, our results suggest that OCD is associated with free radicals and that it may be a heterogeneous subtype including some biological indications of anxiety and affective disorders. More comprehensive and detailed studies are needed to decipher the exact role of free radicals in OCD.</jats:p>",0

Increased respiratory activity with exercise leads to O2- production by the NADPH oxidase reaction and the subsequent generation of H2O2 from O2- by spontaneous dismutation or by the superoxide dismutase reaction. The long-lasting (24-h) depression of contractile function after exercise has been linked to damage of one or more proteins important in the excitation-contraction coupling process. We studied mechanically and chemically skinned fibers from the extensor digitorum longus muscle of the rat to evaluate the effects of a 5-min exposure to 1.0 mM H2O2 on muscle function. We found that H2O2 had no effect on the isometric force-producing properties of the contractile apparatus or on Ca2+ uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It did, however, significantly affect Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Maximum depolarization-induced Ca2+ release was inhibited, and the sensitivity to depolarization was decreased. Ca(2+)-induced release was completely blocked. We conclude that elevated levels of H2O2 with exercise are capable of damaging one or more proteins of the excitation-contraction coupling process to produce a disruption in function that can account, at least in part, for the long-lasting effects of fatiguing stimulation. </jats:p>",0

RV instantaneous intraventricular diastolic pressure and velocity distributions in normal and volume overload awake dog disease models,"<jats:p> Intraventricular diastolic right ventricular (RV) flow field dynamics were studied by functional imaging using three-dimensional (3D) real-time echocardiography with sonomicrometry and computational fluid dynamics in seven awake dogs at control with normal wall motion (NWM) and RV volume overload with diastolic paradoxical septal motion. Burgeoning flow cross section between inflow anulus and chamber walls induces a convective pressure rise, which represents a “convective deceleration load” (CDL). High spatiotemporal resolution dynamic pressure and velocity distributions of the intraventricular RV flow field revealed time-dependent, subtle interactions between intraventricular local acceleration and convective pressure gradients. During the E-wave upstroke, the total pressure gradient along intraventricular flow is the algebraic sum of a pressure decrease contributed by local acceleration and a pressure rise contributed by a convective deceleration that partially counterbalances the local acceleration gradient. This underlies the smallness of early diastolic intraventricular gradients. At peak volumetric inflow, local acceleration vanishes and the total adverse intraventricular gradient is convective. During the E-wave downstroke, the strongly adverse gradient embodies the streamwise pressure augmentations from both local and convective decelerations. It induces flow separation and large-scale vortical motions, stronger in NWM. Their dynamic corollaries on intraventricular pressure and velocity distributions were ascertained. In the NWM pattern, the strong ring-like vortex surrounding the central core encroaches on the area available for flow toward the apex. This results in higher linear velocities later in the downstroke of the E wave than at peak inflow rate. The augmentation of CDL by ventriculoannular disproportion may contribute to E wave and E-to-A ratio depression with chamber dilatation. </jats:p>",0

Effects of tetrodotoxin on the slowly adapting stretch receptor neurone of lobster,"<jats:p>1. A study has been made of the effects of tetrodotoxin on the impulse activity, resting membrane potential, input resistance, and the generator potential and its after‐hyperpolarization of the slowly adapting stretch receptor neurone of the lobster.</jats:p><jats:p>2. Tetrodotoxin was able to abolish completely within about 2 min the impulse activity in most cells, when given in a dose of 2 × 10<jats:sup>−8</jats:sup> g/ml., but in all cells, when administered in a dose of 4 × 10<jats:sup>−8</jats:sup> g/ml. After blockage by the toxin in concentrations as high as 4 × 10<jats:sup>−6</jats:sup> g/ml. for periods of up to 30 min the action potential was restored by washing the preparation in physiological solution for 1 hr.</jats:p><jats:p>3. In a concentration of 4 × 10<jats:sup>−8</jats:sup> g/ml. tetrodotoxin produced within 1–2 min an average increase of 4·8 mV of the resting membrane potential and a simultaneous 47% reduction of the resting input resistance. These effects were reversed by washing the preparation in physiological solution for 1 hr.</jats:p><jats:p>4. Tetrodotoxin administered in doses as high as 4 × 10<jats:sup>−6</jats:sup> g/ml. for periods of up to 30 min had no effect on the amplitude of the steady phase of the generator potential.</jats:p><jats:p>5. In a concentration of 4 × 10<jats:sup>−8</jats:sup> g/ml. tetrodotoxin produced within 5 min a 65% reduction of the amplitude of the hyperpolarization following the generator potential. This effect was reversed by washing the preparation in physiological solution for 1 hr.</jats:p><jats:p>6. The simultaneous increase in resting membrane potential and decrease in membrane resistance is suggested to be due to an elevated potassium permeability besides a reduced sodium conductance. The constancy in height of the generator potential in the presence of a decreased membrane resistance makes necessary the assumption of an augmented generator current. The decrease in amplitude of the hyperpolarization following the generator potential may be the result of an increase in potassium conductance and/or a reduction in acceleration of an electrogenic pump in consequence of a diminished sodium influx during the generator potential.</jats:p>",0

"Maintenance of meiotic arrest in bovine oocytes using the S-enantiomer of roscovitine: effects on maturation, fertilization and subsequent embryo development in vitro","<jats:p>The overall objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the S-enantiomer of roscovitine (inhibitor of p34<jats:sup>cdc2</jats:sup>/cyclin B kinase) to maintain bovine cumulus–oocyte complexes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage for extended times after removal from antral follicles without compromising subsequent maturation, fertilization and embryo development. Oocytes were cultured in 0, 12.5, 25 or 50 μmol/l S-roscovitine for 24 h. Hoechst staining showed that 50 μmol/l S-roscovitine maintained &gt;90% of oocytes at the GV stage and inhibited gonadotropin-induced cumulus expansion. Fewer oocytes underwent nuclear maturation after <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> maturation (Hoechst staining) when cultured in 50 μmol/l S-roscovitine for 66 versus 21 or 42 h. Zona pellucida (ZP) hardening (pronase resistance), cortical granule types (lens culinaris agglutinin–fluorescein isothiocyanate), nuclear maturation and fertilization with frozen-thawed spermatozoa (Hoechst staining) were assessed after culture of oocytes in 50 μmol/l S-roscovitine for 0, 24 or 48 h. Neither ZP hardening, nor nuclear maturation nor fertilization were altered by roscovitine culture for 48 h. A higher proportion of oocytes had a type III cortical granule pattern (premature translocation to the oolemma) after roscovitine culture for 48 h. However, embryo development was not compromised as cleavage, development to 8–16 cell and blastocyst stages were at least comparable in control and roscovitine-treated oocytes. In conclusion, the studies have shown that S-roscovitine reversibly maintained bovine oocytes at the GV stage for 48 h. However, maintenance of oocytes in static culture for 48 h was not sufficient to improve development above non-treated controls.</jats:p>",0

Effects of Imipramine on T Cell Subsets in Olfactory Bulbectomized Mice,"<jats:p>To elucidate the immunological outcome in antidepressant therapy, the effects of acute or chronic imipramine (IMP) treatment on T cell subsets were examined in sham-operated (SO) and olfactory bulbectomized (OB) mice. Olfactory bulbectomy decreased the ratio of Lyt2-positive suppressor T cells to L3T4-positive T helper cells. Acute IMP treatment did not exert any effect on the ratio in SO nor in OB mice. Chronic IMP administration was found to significantly increase the ratio in SO and OB mice and, as a result, the ratio was significantly higher in SO mice compared with the control, while the ratio was normalized in OB mice. The present study may be suggestive of the immune activation in depression and of the immunosuppressive effects of antidepressants.</jats:p>",1
Acute stress‐mediated increases in extracellular glutamate levels in the rat amygdala: differential effects of antidepressant treatment,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Depressive illness is associated with changes in amygdalar volume, and stressful life events are known to precipitate depressive episodes in this patient population. Stress affects amygdalar synaptic plasticity and several neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in stress‐mediated changes in the brain, including the glutamatergic system. However, the role of the glutamatergic system in stress‐mediated plasticity in the amygdala remains to be determined. Accordingly the current study examined the stress modulation of extracellular glutamate levels in the basolateral nucleus (BLA) and the central nucleus (CeA) of the amygdala by <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> microdialysis. Acute stress increased extracellular glutamate levels in the BLA and CeA, although the dynamics of these stress‐mediated changes were dramatically different in these amygdalar nuclei. Tetrodotoxin administration reduced basal, and completely eliminated stress‐mediated increases in glutamate efflux in the amygdala, demonstrating that stress effects are dependent on local axonal depolarization. Moreover, stress‐mediated increases in glutamate efflux in the BLA were inhibited by the antidepressant tianeptine but not by the selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Collectively, these data demonstrate that stress‐induced modulation of glutamate neurochemistry reflects a fundamental pathological change that may contribute to the aetiology and progression of depressive illness, and suggest that some antidepressants such as tianeptine may elicit their clinical effects by modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission.</jats:p>",0

Release of superoxide-dependent relaxing factor(s) from endothelial cells,"<jats:p> In the present work, an experimental system was designed to study superoxide anion radical, implicated as the cause of vascular dilatation. To circumvent its direct effect, we employed a two-bath system. When the endothelial cells (EC) were exposed to electrical field stimulation (EFS) or to a hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase system in bath A plus its physiological buffer solution suffused on a helical strip of cat basilar artery in bath B, the contraction to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was depressed to approximately 40-50% of the control value. The reduction was not elicited on EFS in a state of calcium deficiency or in the absence of EC. The depression could be prevented by pretreatment with superoxide dismutase (SOD), but not with an effective dose of catalase, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), mannitol, or indomethacin. The percent depression of contraction was paralleled by an increase in SOD-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction, which was not associated with cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate formation. These results suggest that superoxide-dependent relaxing factor is released from EC differently than the endothelium-derived relaxing factor mediated by acetylcholine. </jats:p>",0

β-Asarone Reverses Chronic Unpredictable Mild  Stress-Induced Depression-Like Behavior and Promotes Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Rats,"<jats:p>In this study, we investigated the influence of β-asarone, the major ingredient of Acorus tatarinowii Schott, on depressive-like behavior induced by the chronic unpredictable mild stresses (CUMS) paradigm and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. The results show that β-asarone treatment partially reversed the CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors in both the forced swim and sucrose preference tests. The behavioral effects were associated with increased hippocampal neurogenesis indicated by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunoreactivity. β-Asarone treatment significantly increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at levels of transcription and translation. Moreover, CUMS caused significant reduction in ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation, both of which were partially attenuated by β-asarone administration. It is important to note that β-asarone treatment had no effect on total levels or phosphorylation state of any of the proteins examined in ERK1/2-CREB pathway in no stress rats, suggesting that β-asarone acts in a stress-dependent manner to block ERK1/2-CREB signaling. We did not observe a complete reversal of depression-like behaviors to control levels by β-asarone. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that adult neurogenesis is involved in the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of β-asarone, suggesting that β-asarone is a promising candidate for the treatment of depression.</jats:p>",1

Effect of maternal ethanol consumption on foetal and neonatal rat hepatic protein synthesis,"<jats:p>Effects of maternal ethanol consumption were investigated on the rates of protein synthehsis by livers of foetal and neonatal rats both in vivo and in vitro, and on the activities of enzymes involved in protein synthesis and degradation. The rates of general protein synthesis by ribosomes in vitro studied by measuring the incorporation of [14C]leucine into ribosomal protein showed that maternal ethanol consumption resulted in an inhibition of the rates of protein synthesis by both foetal and neonatal livers from the ethanol-fed group. The rates of incorporation of intravenously injected [14C]leucine into hepatic proteins were also significantly lower in the foetal, neonatal and adult livers from the ethanol-fed group. Incubation of adult-rat liver slices with ethanol resulted in an inhibition of the incorporation of [14C]leucine into hepatic proteins; however, this effect was not observed in the foetal liver slices. This effect of externally added ethanol was at least partially prevented by the addition of pyrazole to the adult liver slices. Pyrazole addition to foetal liver slices was without significant effect on the rates of protein synthesis. Cross-mixing experiments showed that the capacity of both hepatic ribosomes and pH5 enzyme fractions to synthesize proteins was decreased in the foetal liver from the ethanol-fed group. Maternal ethanol consumption resulted in a decrease in hepatic total RNA content, RNA/DNA ratio and ribosomal protein content in the foetal liver. Foetal hepatic DNA content was not significantly affected. Ethanol consumption resulted in a significant decrease in proteolytic activity and the activity of tryptophan oxygenase in the foetal, neonatal and adult livers. It is possible that the mechanisms of inhibition of protein synthesis observed here in the foetal liver after maternal ethanol consumption may be responsible for at least some of the changes observed in ‘foetal alcohol syndrome’.</jats:p>",0

At necropsy, abnormal venous drainage of the right cranial and middle lung lobes was found. A dilated major pulmonary vein from these lobes passed across the lateral aspect of the right caudal lung lobe prior to entering the heart, and subpleural veins from the affected lobes were enlarged and tortuous. These vascular abnormalities were considered incidental. There were no apparent congenital abnormalities of the heart and the animal's clinical signs were related to lymphoma of the brain.</jats:p>",0

The protein kinase mTOR is a critical regulator of protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus as well as synaptic plasticity associated with central and peripheral pain sensitization. We examined the role of mTOR signaling in pain-associated entorhinal cortex (EC) - hippocampal synaptic plasticity to reveal possible cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of chronic pain on cognition and emotion. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p> Subcutaneous injection of bee venom (BV) into one hind paw to induce PPN resulted in sustained (&gt; 8 h) mTOR phospho-activation and enhanced phosphorylation of the mTOR target p70 S6 kinase (S6K) in the hippocampus. The magnitude and duration of long-term potentiation (LTP) in both EC - dentate gyrus (DG) and EC - CA1 synaptic pathways were elevated in BV-treated rats as measured by microelectrode array recording. Moreover, the number of potentiated synapses in the hippocampus was markedly upregulated by BV-induced PPN. Both elevated mTOR-S6K signaling and enhanced LTP induced by BV injection were reversed by systemic injection of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA). Rats injected with BV exhibited markedly reduced ambulation and exploratory activity in the open field (signs of depression and anxiety) compared to controls, and these effects were also reversed by RAPA. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p> We suggest that PPN-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity in EC - hippocampal pathways and the behavioral effects of PPN are dependent on mTOR-S6K signaling. </jats:p></jats:sec>",0
Suppressive Effect of Juzen‐Taiho‐To on Lung Metastasis of B16 Melanoma Cells <i>In Vivo</i>,"<jats:p>Juzen‐Taiho‐To (JTT) is well known to be one of Kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine consisted of 10 component herbs and used for the supplemental therapy of cancer patients with remarkably success. However, the precise mechanisms by which JTT could favorably modify the clinical conditions of cancer patients are not well defined. The present study, therefore, was undertaken to examine the possible mechanisms of JTT on prevention of cancer metastasis using experimental mouse model. JTT was well mixed with rodent chow at concentrations of either 0.2 or 1.0%, and administered orally <jats:italic>ad libitum</jats:italic>, which was started 1 week before tumor cell injection and continue throughout the experiment. Oral administration of JTT at concentration 0.2 and 1.0% into C57BL/6 male mice significantly inhibited tumor metastasis in lungs, which was induced by the intravenous injection of 2 × 10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> B16 melanoma cell. JTT at a concentration of 1.0% also significantly suppressed lung metastasis of B16 melanoma cell from hind footpad in C57BL/6 mice. In the second part of experiments, the influence of the depression of natural killer (NK) cell, natural killer T (NKT) cell and several types of cytokines on JTT‐mediated inhibition of tumor cell metastasis. Intraperitoneal injection of anti asialo‐GM1 antibody against NK cells and anti NK‐1.1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to NKT cells abrogated the inhibitory action of JTT on lung metastasis of B16 melanoma cells. Although intraperitoneal administration of anti‐IFN‐<jats:italic>γ</jats:italic> mAb scarcely affected the inhibitory action of JTT on tumor cell metastasis, injection of amrinone, which used for IL‐12 suppression, significantly decreased the ability of JTT to prevent tumor cell metastasis. These results strongly suggest that oral administration of JTT caused increase in the production of IL‐12, which is responsible for the activation of both NK cell and NKT cell, in the lungs and results in inhibition of B16 melanoma cell metastasis in the lungs.</jats:p>",0

In vivo Dilatation of the Ductus Arteriosus by Rho Kinase Inhibition in the Rat,"<jats:p>&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt; Fasudil hydrochloride, a Rho kinase inhibitor, was reported to dilate the constricted ductus arteriosus in vitro, and was suggested as a neonatal bridge to heart surgery. &lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt; To clarify the in vivo effectiveness of fasudil to dilate the neonatal ductus arteriosus, and its usefulness as a bridge to heart surgery. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; We studied the dose and timing of administration of fasudil in the neonatal rat. Postnatal ductal closure was studied on the 21st gestational day following cesarean section and incubation for 30–480 min in room air at 33°C, with a rapid whole-body freezing method. In control rats, the ductus closed rapidly after birth, and the ductal diameter was 0.80 and 0.12 mm at 0 and 30 min after birth. Fasudil was injected peritoneally into the neonate, and the ductus was studied 30 min after injection and 60 min after birth. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Fasudil, 10 mg/kg, injected within 5 min after birth, dilated the ductus completely to 0.8 mm, and the dose used clinically, 1 mg/kg, dilated the ductus to 0.4 mm. The ductus-dilating effect of fasudil decreased rapidly as the neonatal ductus constricted. Fasudil, 100 mg/kg, dilated the ductus completely, but induced severe respiratory depression and frequent death in 1-hour-old rats. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; Fasudil dilates the neonatal ductus arteriosus dose-dependently in the rat. Fasudil in large doses dilates the neonatal ductus completely, but is associated with fatal side effects, including respiratory depression.</jats:p>",0
Effects of Dopamine and Other Catecholamines on the Splanchnic Circulation,"<jats:p> Studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of dopamine (3, 4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine) and other catecholamines on the mesenteric vascular bed in dogs. Mesenteric and hepatic artery blood flows were measured with electromagnetic blood flow transducers. Catecholamines were infused intra-arterially into a branch-of the mesenteric artery. Dopamine consistently decreased mesenteric and hepatic artery blood flows at all dose levels studied (5–100 mg/kg). Phenoxybenzamine (12.5 mg/kg) blocked the effects of norepinephrine (0.05–1.0 μg/kg) and reversed the responses to dopamine in the mesenteric bed to those of pure vasodilation (no transient constriction was observed) but failed to abolish the constrictor action of dopamine on the hepatic artery. Propranolol or haloperidol, when administered with the phenoxybenzamine, did not attenuate the mesenteric responses to dopamine. Haloperidol prevented the hepatic artery vasoconstriction produced by dopamine but did not alter isoproterenol-induced hepatic artery vasodilation. No competitive action was observed between dopamine and norepinephrine or isoproterenol. These results suggest that (1) dopamine produces selective vasodilation of the mesenteric bed which is not blocked by haloperidol, and (2) dopamine has a unique action on the hepatic vascular bed which is blocked by haloperidol. </jats:p>",0

Impairment of macrophage functions after ingestion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes or isolated malarial pigment.,"<jats:p>Human monocyte-derived macrophages ingest diamide-treated red blood cells (RBC), anti-D immunoglobulin (Ig)G-opsonized RBC, or Plasmodium falciparum ring-stage parasitized RBC (RPRBC), degrade ingested hemoglobin rapidly, and can repeat the phagocytic cycle. Monocytes fed with trophozoite-parasitized RBC (TPRBC), which contain malarial pigment, or fed with isolated pigment are virtually unable to degrade the ingested material and to repeat the phagocytic cycle. Monocytes fed with pigment display a long-lasting oxidative burst that does not occur when they phagocytose diamide-treated RBC or RPRBC. The phorbol myristate acetate-elicited oxidative burst is irreversibly suppressed in monocytes fed with TPRBC or pigment, but not in monocytes fed with diamide-treated or IgG-opsonized RBC. This pattern of inhibition of phagocytosis and oxidative burst suggests that malarial pigment is responsible for the toxic effects. Pigment iron released in the monocyte phagolysosome may be the responsible element. 3% of total pigment iron is labile and easily detached under conditions simulating the internal environment of the phagolysosome, i.e., pH 5.5 and 10 microM H2O2. Iron liberated from pigment could account for the lipid peroxidation and increased production of malondialdehyde observed in monocytes fed with pigment or in RBC ghosts and liposomes incubated at pH 6.5 in presence of pigment and low amounts of H2O2. Removal of the labile iron fraction from pigment by repeated treatments with 0.1 mM H2O2 at pH 5.5 reduces pigment toxicity. It is suggested that iron released from ingested pigment is responsible for the intoxication of monocytes. In acute and chronic falciparum infections, circulating and tissue-resident phagocytes are seen filled with TPRBC and pigment particles over long periods of time. Moreover, human monocytes previously fed with TPRBC are unable to neutralize pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and tumor cells, and macrophage responses decline during the course of human and animal malaria. The present results may offer a mechanistic explanation for depression of cellular immunity in malaria.</jats:p>",0

Quantitative Analysis of Calcium-Dependent Vesicle Recruitment and Its Functional Role at the Calyx of Held Synapse,"<jats:p>Recruitment of release-ready vesicles at synapses is one of the important factors, which determine dynamic properties of signaling between neurons in the brain. It has been shown that the rate of vesicle recruitment is accelerated by strong synaptic activity. An elevated concentration of calcium ions in the presynaptic terminal ([Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>]<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>) has been proposed to be responsible for this effect. However, the precise relationship between [Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>]<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>and recruitment has not been established yet, and the functional consequences of accelerated recruitment during synaptic activity have not been quantified experimentally. To probe the intracellular Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>dependence of vesicle recruitment and to examine its functional role during trains of action potential (AP)-like stimuli, we monitored [Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>]<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>and synaptic responses simultaneously with paired recordings at the calyx of Held synapse. We found that a distinct, rapidly releasing vesicle pool is replenished with a rate that increases linearly with [Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>]<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>, without any apparent cooperativity. The slope factor for this increase is ∼1 pool/(μ<jats:sc>m</jats:sc>·s). Blocking Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>-dependent recruitment specifically with a calmodulin binding peptide revealed that the steady-state EPSCs during 100 Hz AP-like trains were maintained through this Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>-dependent recruitment mechanism. Using a simple model of vesicle dynamics, we estimated that the recruitment rate accelerated 10-fold during the steady-state compared with the rate at resting [Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>]<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>. We could also demonstrate an approximate sixfold increase in release probability (facilitation) during the initial 5–15 AP-like stimuli of such trains in our experimental condition, regardless of EPSC depression.</jats:p>",0
INHIBITION BY INDOMETHACIN OF OVULATION INDUCED BY HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPHIN IN IMMATURE RATS PRIMED WITH PREGNANT MARE SERUM GONADOTROPHIN,"<jats:p>Treatment of immature rats with pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin followed by human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) caused an acute and temporary increase in concentrations of progesterone, testosterone and oestradiol in plasma with maximum levels 3 h after the administration of HCG.</jats:p>
      <jats:p>Concurrent injection of indomethacin and HCG reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the mean number of ova shed and this was accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in concentrations of plasma progesterone and testosterone but not of oestradiol when they were measured 3 h after the injection of HCG. The minimum effective dose that blocked ovulation completely at 0 h abolished the acute increase of progesterone and testosterone, suggesting that prostaglandins act on ovulation by stimulating steroidogenesis at an early stage in the preovulatory process. The anti-ovulatory action of the minimum effective dose at 0 h became progressively less potent as the time between injection of HCG and administration of indomethacin was increased, although plasma concentrations of progesterone and testosterone measured at autopsy 18 h after treatment with HCG had not changed appreciably. When indomethacin was administered 10 h after HCG, the relationship between the dose of indomethacin and the mean number of ova differed from that observed when simultaneous injections of indomethacin and HCG were given, and the minimum effective dose that prevented ovulation was much higher than that at 0 h, suggesting that prostaglandins act differently on ovulation in the later stage of the preovulatory process.</jats:p>
      <jats:p>It was concluded that prostaglandins may mediate the action of HCG on ovulation through two mechanisms which operate at different stages of the preovulatory process.</jats:p>",0

Molecular determinants for selective recognition of antidepressants in the human serotonin and norepinephrine transporters,"<jats:p>
            Inhibitors of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) are widely used in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Although SERT/NET selectivity is a key determinant for the therapeutic properties of these drugs, the molecular determinants defining SERT/NET selectivity are poorly understood. In this study, the structural basis for selectivity of the SERT selective inhibitor citalopram and the structurally closely related NET selective inhibitor talopram is delineated. A systematic structure-activity relationship study allowed identification of the substituents that control activity and selectivity toward SERT and NET and revealed a common pattern showing that SERT and NET have opposite preference for the stereochemical configuration of these inhibitors. Mutational analysis of nonconserved SERT/NET residues within the central substrate binding site was performed to determine the molecular basis for inhibitor selectivity. Changing only five residues in NET to the complementary residues in SERT transferred a SERT-like affinity profile for

            -talopram was largely unaffected by any mutations within the central substrate binding site of SERT and NET and in the outer vestibule of NET, suggesting that citalopram and talopram bind to distinct sites on SERT and NET. Together, these findings provide important insight into the molecular basis for SERT/NET selectivity of antidepressants, which can be used to guide rational development of unique transporter inhibitors with fine-tuned transporter selectivity.

Sustained Running in Rats Administered Corticosterone Prevents the Development of Depressive Behaviors and Enhances Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Synaptic Plasticity without Increasing Neurotrophic Factor Levels,"<jats:p> We have previously shown that voluntary running acts as an anxiolytic and ameliorates deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial learning. It also reduces depression-like behaviors that are normally observed in rats that were administered either low (30 mg/kg) or moderate (40 mg/kg) doses of corticosterone (CORT). However, the protective effects of running were absent in rats treated with a high (50 mg/kg) dose of CORT. We examined whether allowing animals to exercise for 2 weeks prior and/or concurrently with the administration of 50 mg/kg CORT treatment could have similar protective effects. We examined hippocampal neurogenesis using immuno-histochemical staining of proliferative and survival cells with the thymidine analogs (BrdU, CIdU, and IdU). In addition, we monitored synaptic protein expression and quantified the levels of neurotrophic factors in these animals as well as performing behavioral analyses (forced swim test and sucrose preference test). Our results indicate that the depressive phenotype and reductions in neurogenesis that normally accompany high CORT administration could only be prevented by allowing animals to exercise both prior to and concurrently with the CORT administration period. These animals also showed increases in both synaptophysin and PSD-95 protein levels, but surprisingly, neither brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) nor insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels were increased in these animals. The results suggest that persistent exercise can strengthen resilience to stress by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and increasing synaptic protein levels, thereby reducing the deleterious effects of stress. </jats:p>",1

Mercury Inhibition of Neutrophil Activity: Evidence of Aberrant Cellular Signalling and Incoherent Cellular Metabolism,"<jats:p>Exposure to environmental heavy metals has been reported to affect the immune system. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Hg<jats:sup>+2</jats:sup>, acting through membrane proteins, disrupts metabolic dynamics and downstream cell functions in human neutrophils. We found that HgCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> inhibited: (1) polarization and (2) immunoglobulin (Ig)G‐mediated phagocytosis of sheep erythrocytes in a dose‐dependent manner from 2.5 to 10 µ<jats:sc>m</jats:sc>. Because these activities have been linked with pro‐inflammatory signalling, we also studied the effects of HgCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on intracellular signalling by measuring protein tyrosine phosphorylation. HgCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> at doses = 1 µ<jats:sc>m</jats:sc> increased tyrosine phosphorylation. We also studied the effect of HgCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on neutrophil metabolism by measuring NAD(P)H autofluorescence as an indicator of intracellular NAD(P)H concentration. After HgCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> treatment, we found that normal sinusoidal NAD(P)H oscillations became incoherent. We recently reported that the NAD(P)H oscillation frequency is affected by cell migration and activation, which can in turn be regulated by integrin‐mediated signalling. Therefore, we examined the effects of HgCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on cell surface distribution of membrane proteins. After exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of HgCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> we found that CR3, but not other membrane proteins (e.g. uPAR, FcγRIIA and the formyl peptide receptor), became clustered on cell surfaces. We suggest that HgCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> disrupts integrin signalling/functional pathways in neutrophils.</jats:p>",0

Selective 5‐HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor inhibition of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic activity in the rat dorsal and median raphe,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The dorsal (DR) and median (MR) raphe nuclei contain 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT) cell bodies that give rise to the majority of the ascending 5‐HT projections to the forebrain. The DR and MR have differential roles in mediating stress, anxiety and depression. Glutamate and GABA activity sculpt putative 5‐HT neuronal firing and 5‐HT release in a seemingly differential manner in the MR and DR, yet isolated glutamate and GABA activity within the DR and MR has not been systematically characterized. Visualized whole‐cell voltage‐clamp techniques were used to record excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSC and IPSC) in 5‐HT‐containing neurons. There was a regional variation in action potential‐dependent (spontaneous) and basal [miniature (m)] glutamate and GABAergic activity. mEPSC activity was greater than mIPSC activity in the DR, whereas in the MR the mIPSC activity was greater. These differences in EPSC and IPSC frequency indicate that glutamatergic and GABAergic input have distinct cytoarchitectures in the DR and MR. 5‐HT<jats:sub>1B</jats:sub> receptor activation decreased mEPSC frequency in the DR and the MR, but selectively inhibited mIPSC activity only in the MR. This finding, in concert with its previously described function as an autoreceptor, suggests that 5‐HT<jats:sub>1B</jats:sub> receptors influence the ascending 5‐HT system through multiple mechanisms. The disparity in organization and integration of glutamatergic and GABAergic input to DR and MR neurons and their regulation by 5‐HT<jats:sub>1B</jats:sub> receptors may contribute to the distinction in MR and DR regulation of forebrain regions and their differential function in the aetiology and pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disease states.</jats:p>",0

Protective Effect of Ifenprodil Against Spreading Depression in the Mouse Entorhinal Cortex,"<jats:p> In the brain, spreading depression (SD) is characterized by a large extracellular DC shift, a massive failure of ion homeostasis and a transient cessation of neuronal function. Clinically, SD is believed to be involved in various neurological disorders including migraine and cerebrovascular diseases. The propagation of cortical SD requires the release of glutamate, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a crucial role in this process. Here, we have isolated the NMDA receptor-mediated component of extracellularly recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in layers 2–3 of the entorhinal cortex of murine brain slices. In the absence of GABA<jats:sub>A</jats:sub> and AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission, stimulation of layer 6 afferents every 15–90 s elicited spontaneous SD on average within 18.5 min after the start of the stimulation. In the presence of ifenprodil, an NR2B receptor subunit-selective NMDA receptor antagonist, the occurrence of SD was nearly abolished. Our results are consistent with an important role of NR2B subunits in triggering SD in the entorhinal cortex. </jats:p>",0

Effect of lutropin and cycloheximide on lutropin receptors and cyclic AMP production in Leydig tumour cells <i>in vitro</i>,"<jats:p>A system to study lutropin-induced desensitization of tumour Leydig cells in vitro has been investigated. Tumour Leydig cells were purified on a Percoll gradient and then incubated for 30 min with lutropin (0-1000ng/ml). The cells were then washed and incubated in suspension media at 32 degrees C. 125I-labelled human choriogonadotropin binding and basal and lutropin-stimulated cyclic AMP production were determined at various times. Initially the cells showed a dose-dependent decrease in human choriogonadotropin binding (1.18 and 0.13fmol/10(6) cells respectively) followed by an increase at 1 h (2.32 and 0.87fmol/10(6) cells respectively). Human choriogonadotropin binding remained elevated in the cells pre-incubated without lutropin, whereas the cells pre-incubated with lutropin showed a dose-dependent decrease over the next 10 h (2.20-0.18fmol/10(6) cells respectively). Basal production of cyclic AMP initially reflected the pre-incubation conditions (1.17-21.19ng/10(6) cells per h for 0-1000ng of lutropin/ml respectively). However, by 1 h there was a marked rise in basal cyclic AMP production which returned to the initial lower values by 4 h. At all time intervals studied, lutropin-induced cyclic AMP production showed a decrease that was proportional to lutropin concentration in the pre-incubated media. The decreases in human choriogonadotropin binding produced by pre-incubations with lutropin (100ng/ml) was partially inhibited by the presence of cycloheximide in the pre-incubation media and totally prevented by the continuous presence of cycloheximide. These results demonstrate that desensitization of tumour Leydig cells occurs after exposure to lutropin in vitro. This desensitization involves both a loss of plasma membrane receptors for lutropin and lutropin-stimulated adenylate cyclase. These events can be prevented by cycloheximide and are therefore probably dependent on protein synthesis.</jats:p>",0

‘The black dog just came and sat on my face and built a kennel’: Gay men making sense of ‘depression’,"<jats:p> This article reports on in-depth interviews with gay men about their experiences and understanding of depression. It is a key outcome of the collaboration between social researchers, general practitioners and community partners to investigate the management of depression in gay men in primary care settings. As part of the qualitative arm of the project in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 gay men in Sydney and Adelaide (Australia). The approach to discourse analysis is informed by Hallidayan systemic functional linguistics. Six constructions of depression were identified: (1) depression as a constellation of symptoms; (2) symptoms constructed as experience; (3) depression as agent; (4) depression as mental processes; (5) not meeting social expectations; and (6) engaging with psychiatric discourse: constructing alternative positions. Gay men draw on the biomedical model of depression as low mood and loss of pleasure as well as on constructions of depression in terms of social experience. The biomedical model of depression is, however, not positioned as unproblematic. Rather, gay men align or disalign with this discourse according to their own experience, thereby enacting diverse masculinities. Gay men’s discourses of depression are inextricably linked to the community activism of gay men and their community organizations in the context of the HIV epidemic, as well as a synergy between gay men and their doctors. </jats:p>",0

The rate of hydrolysis decreases as the acyl chain length of the substrates increases. The activity against triglycerides of short-chain fatty acids and monoacylesters could be partially separated from that of glycerol-trioleate lipase by ammonium sulfate fractionation. The activity of glycerol-trioleate lipase remained unaffected by heating for 5 min at 60 °C or by addition of bile acids, whereas the activity causing hydrolysis of triglycerides with short-chain fatty acids and monoacylesters decreases up to 60% by analogous treatment. No changes in the hydrolytic activity occurs in presence of sodium heparin. This indicates that this activity is not identical with a lipoprotein lipase.</jats:p>",0

The Effects of Acute Stress-Induced Sleep Disturbance on Acoustic Trauma-Induced Tinnitus in Rats,"<jats:p>Chronic tinnitus is a debilitating condition and often accompanied by anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. It has been suggested that sleep disturbance, such as insomnia, may be a risk factor/predictor for tinnitus-related distress and the two conditions may share common neurobiological mechanisms. This study investigated whether acute stress-induced sleep disturbance could increase the susceptibility to acoustic trauma-induced tinnitus in rats. The animals were exposed to unilateral acoustic trauma 24 h before sleep disturbance being induced using the cage exchange method. Tinnitus perception was assessed behaviourally using a conditioned lick suppression paradigm 3 weeks after the acoustic trauma. Changes in the orexin system in the hypothalamus, which plays an important role in maintaining long-lasting arousal, were also examined using immunohistochemistry. Cage exchange resulted in a significant reduction in the number of sleep episodes and acoustic trauma-induced tinnitus with acoustic features similar to a 32 kHz tone at 100 dB. However, sleep disturbance did not exacerbate the perception of tinnitus in rats. Neither tinnitus alone nor tinnitus plus sleep disturbance altered the number of orexin-expressing neurons. The results suggest that acute sleep disturbance does not cause long-term changes in the number of orexin neurons and does not change the perception of tinnitus induced by acoustic trauma in rats.</jats:p>",0

Pathobiology of A/Chicken/Hong Kong/220/97 (H5N1) Avian Influenza Virus in Seven Gallinaceous Species,"<jats:p> Direct bird-to-human transmission, with the production of severe respiratory disease and human mortality, is unique to the Hong Kong-origin H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, which was originally isolated from a disease outbreak in chickens. The pathobiology of the A/chicken/Hong Kong/ 220/97 (H5N1) (HK/220) HPAI virus was investigated in chickens, turkeys, Japanese and Bobwhite quail, guinea fowl, pheasants, and partridges, where it produced 75-100% mortality within 10 days. Depression, mucoid diarrhea, and neurologic dysfunction were common clinical manifestations of disease. Grossly, the most severe and consistent lesions included splenomegaly, pulmonary edema and congestion, and hemorrhages in enteric lymphoid areas, on serosal surfaces, and in skeletal muscle. Histologic lesions were observed in multiple organs and were characterized by exudation, hemorrhage, necrosis, inflammation, or a combination of these features. The lung, heart, brain, spleen, and adrenal glands were the most consistently affected, and viral antigen was most often detected by immunohistochemistry in the parenchyma of these organs. The pathogenesis of infection with the HK/220 HPAI virus in these species was twofold. Early mortality occurring at 1-2 days postinoculation (DPI) corresponded to severe pulmonary edema and congestion and virus localization within the vascular endothelium. Mortality occurring after 2 DPI was related to systemic biochemical imbalance, multiorgan failure, or a combination of these factors. The pathobiologic features were analogous to those experimentally induced with other HPAI viruses in domestic poultry. </jats:p>",0
Acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor levels in spinal cord cultures are not regulated by alterations in heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>The present study was undertaken to assess both the levels of acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors in spinal cord cultures and to determine how they were presented to responsive cells. Western blots detected a single acidic fibroblast growth factor‐like protein (17 kDa) and two (18 kDa, 24 kDa) basic fibroblast growth factor‐immunoreactive proteins, the levels of which varied with the antibody used. Levels of all three proteins were unaltered in cultures grown in the presence of a mitotic inhibitor, which greatly reduced the number of astrocytes. Cell blots showed increased survival of spinal cord neurons at M<jats:sub>r</jats:sub> that corresponded with the three proteins detected immunologically. Solubilized cultures separated on a P100 column showed mitogenic activity for NIH3T3 cells from 17–18 and 24 kDa fractions. Treatment of the cultures with heparitinase did not decrease the levels of acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors detected by Western blots, suggesting that these proteins were not associated with extracellular membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The major fraction of both proteins appeared to be intracellular with a minor amount complexed with extracellular matrix proteins. An inhibitor of xylose‐linked proteoglycan synthesis significantly altered heparan sulfate proteoglycan deposition into extracellular matrix, but did not alter the levels of acidic or basic fibroblast growth factors detected by Western blots, or the levels of choline acetyltransferase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, or aspartate aminotransferase activities. These results indicate that both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors are stored predominantly intracellularly, with only a minor fraction complexed with extracellular proteins. We suggest that these intracellular proteins may be released following injury in the CNS and mediate a cascade of neuroprotective events.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Calcium-Dependent But Action Potential-Independent BCM-Like Metaplasticity in the Hippocampus,"<jats:p>The Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (BCM) computational model, which incorporates a metaplastic sliding threshold for LTP induction, accounts well for experience-dependent changes in synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex. BCM-like metaplasticity over a shorter timescale has also been observed in the hippocampus, thus providing a tractable experimental preparation for testing specific predictions of the model. Here, using extracellular and intracellular electrophysiological recordings from acute rat hippocampal slices, we tested the critical BCM predictions (1) that high levels of synaptic activation will induce a metaplastic state that spreads across dendritic compartments, and (2) that postsynaptic cell-firing is the critical trigger for inducing that state. In support of the first premise, high-frequency priming stimulation inhibited subsequent long-term potentiation and facilitated subsequent long-term depression at synapses quiescent during priming, including those located in a dendritic compartment different to that of the primed pathway. These effects were not dependent on changes in synaptic inhibition or NMDA/metabotropic glutamate receptor function. However, in contrast to the BCM prediction, somatic action potentials during priming were neither necessary nor sufficient to induce the metaplasticity effect. Instead, in broad agreement with derivatives of the BCM model, calcium as released from intracellular stores and triggered by M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation was critical for altering subsequent synaptic plasticity. These results indicate that synaptic plasticity in stratum radiatum of CA1 can be homeostatically regulated by the cell-wide history of synaptic activity through a calcium-dependent but action potential-independent mechanism.</jats:p>",0

Cyclic AMP plays a critical role in C3a-receptor–mediated regulation of dendritic cells in antigen uptake and T-cell stimulation,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The biochemical basis for complement acting directly on antigen-presenting cells to enhance their function in T-cell stimulation has been unclear. Here we present evidence that engagement of C3a receptor (C3aR) on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) leads to alterations in the level of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a potent negative regulator of inflammatory cytokines. C3aR activation-induced depression of cAMP was associated with enhanced capacity of DCs for antigen uptake and T-cell stimulation. Conversely, C3aR-deficient DCs showed elevation of cAMP and impaired properties for antigen uptake and immune stimulation. Similarities in the phenotype of C3-deficient and C3aR-deficient DCs suggest that local production of C3 with extracellular metabolism to C3a is an important driver of DC alterations in cAMP. The finding of a link between complement and adaptive immune stimulation through cAMP offers new insight into how innate and adaptive immunity combine to generate efficient effector and memory responses.</jats:p>",0

Analysis of a Metalloporphyrin Antioxidant Mimetic (MnTE-2-PyP) as a Radiomitigator: Prostate Tumor and Immune Status,"<jats:p> Due to radiation-induced immune depression and development of pathologies such as cancer, there is increasing urgency to identify radiomitigators that are effective when administered after radiation exposure. The main goal of this study was to determine the radiomitigation capacity of MnTE-2-PyP[Mn(III) tetrakis (N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl) porphyrin], a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, and evaluate leukocyte parameters in spleen and blood. C57BL/6 mice were total-body exposed to 2 Gy γ-rays (Co-60), i.e., well below a lethal dose, followed by subcutaneous implantation of 5 × 10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> RM-9 prostate tumor cells and initiation of MnTE-2-PyP treatment (day 0); interval between each procedure was 1–2 h. The drug was administered daily (12 times). Tumor progression was monitored and immunological analyses were performed on a subset per group on day 12. Animals treated with MnTE-2-PyP alone had significantly slower tumor growth compared to mice that did not receive the drug (P &lt; 0.05), while radiation alone had no effect. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with MnTE-2-PyP alone significantly increased spleen mass relative to body mass; the numbers of splenic white blood cells (WBC) and lymphocytes (B and T), as well as circulating WBC, granulocytes, and platelets, were high compared to one of more of the other groups (P &lt; 0.05). The results show that MnTE-2-PyP slowed RM-9 tumor progression and up-regulated immune parameters, but mitigation of the effects of 2 Gy total-body irradiation were minimal. </jats:p>",0

Early Life Stress Alters Adult Serotonin 2C Receptor Pre-mRNA Editing and Expression of the α Subunit of the Heterotrimeric G-Protein Gq,"<jats:p>Infant maternal separation, a paradigm of early life stress in rodents, elicits long-lasting changes in gene expression that persist into adulthood. In BALB/c mice, an inbred strain with spontaneously elevated anxiety and stress reactivity, infant maternal separation led to increased depression-like behavioral responses to adult stress and robustly increased editing of serotonin 2C receptor pre-mRNA. Chronic fluoxetine treatment of adult BALB/c mice exposed to early life stress affected neither their behavioral responses to stress nor their basal 5-HT<jats:sub>2C</jats:sub>pre-mRNA editing phenotype. However, when fluoxetine was administered during adolescence, depression-like behavioral responses to stress were significantly diminished in these mice, and their basal and stress-induced 5-HT<jats:sub>2C</jats:sub>pre-mRNA editing phenotypes were significantly lower. Moreover, when BALB/c mice exposed to early life stress were raised in an enriched postweaning environment, their depression-like behavioral responses to adult stress were also significantly diminished. However, their 5-HT<jats:sub>2C</jats:sub>pre-mRNA editing phenotype remained unaltered. Hence, the similar behavioral effects of enrichment and fluoxetine treatment during adolescence were not accompanied by similar changes in 5-HT<jats:sub>2C</jats:sub>pre-mRNA editing. Enriched and nonenriched BALB/c mice exposed to early life stress also exhibited significantly increased expression of mRNA and protein encoding the Gαq subunit of G-protein that couples to 5-HT<jats:sub>2A/2C</jats:sub>receptors. In contrast, Gαq expression levels were significantly lower in fluoxetine-treated mice. These findings suggest that compensatory changes in Gαq expression occur in mice with persistently altered 5-HT<jats:sub>2C</jats:sub>pre-mRNA editing and provide an explanation for the dissociation between 5-HT<jats:sub>2C</jats:sub>receptor editing phenotypes and behavioral stress responses.</jats:p>",1

Enaminones and norepinephrine employ convergent mechanisms to depress excitatory synaptic transmission in the rat nucleus accumbens <i>in vitro</i>,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We recently reported that anticonvulsant anilino enaminones depress excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) indirectly via γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting on GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> receptors [<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b1"">S.B. Kombian <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>. (2005)</jats:ext-link><jats:italic>Br. J. Pharmacol</jats:italic>., 145, 945–953]. Norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), both known to be involved in seizure disorders, also depress EPSCs in this nucleus. The current study explored a possible interaction between enaminones and adrenergic and/or dopaminergic mechanisms that may contribute to their synaptic depression and anticonvulsant effect. Using whole‐cell recording in rat forebrain slices containing the NAc, we show that NE‐induced, but not DA‐induced, EPSC depression occludes E139‐induced EPSC depressant effect. UK14,304, a selective α<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> receptor agonist, mimicked the synaptic effect of NE and also occluded E139 effects. Phentolamine, a non‐selective α‐adrenergic antagonist that blocked NE‐induced EPSC depression, also blocked the E139‐induced EPSC depression. Furthermore, yohimbine, an α<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐adrenoceptor antagonist, also blocked the E139‐induced EPSC depression, while prazosin, a selective α<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>‐adrenergic antagonist, and propranolol, a non‐selective β‐adrenoceptor antagonist, did not block the E139 effect. Similar to the E139‐induced EPSC depression, the NE‐induced EPSC depression was also blocked by the GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> receptor antagonist, CGP55845. By contrast, however, neither SCH23390 nor sulpiride, D1‐like and D2‐like DA receptor antagonists, respectively, blocked the E139‐induced synaptic depression. These results suggest that NE and E139, but not DA, employ a similar mechanism to depress EPSCs in the NAc, and support the hypothesis that E139, like NE, may act on α<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐adrenoceptors to cause the release of GABA, which then mediates synaptic depression via GABA<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> receptors.</jats:p>",0

α‐Amanitin and 5‐fluorouridine inhibition of serumstimulated DNA synthesis in quiescent AKR‐2B mouse embryo cells,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>AKR‐2B mouse embryo cells undergoing the serum‐stimulated transition from a quiescent to a proliferating state exhibit an increase in the rate of hnRNA synthesis which appears to be mediated through an increase in the actual number of RNA polymerase II molecules. α‐Amanitin, administered early in the prereplication interval following stimulation, effectively inhibits hnRNA synthesis, polysomal mRNA accumulation, polyribosome formation, and subsequent DNA synthesis, and cell division. Unexpectedly, α‐amanitin treatment also produces almost complete inhibition of the synthesis of 45SrRNA precursor and the increase in accumulation of cytoplasmic rRNA following serum stimulation. In order to determine whether the inhibition of new ribosomal synthesis might in itself be sufficient to prevent serum‐stimulated DNA synthesis, the effects of 5‐fluorouridine (5‐FU), a specific inhibitor of 45SrRNA processing, were investigated. If added within eight hours following serum stimulation, 5‐FU was found to completely inhibit subsequent DNA synthesis. These results suggest that quescent AKR‐2B cells do not contain a sufficient excess of ribosomes to support the synthesis of proteins which are required for DNA synthesis in response to serum growth factors. Furthermore, an early polymerase II mediated synthesis of mRNA (s) coding for some factor(S) necessary for ribosomal gene transcription may be an essential step in the serum‐stimulated synthesis of new ribosomes.</jats:p>",0

Elimination of exercise-induced regional myocardial dysfunction by a bradycardiac agent in dogs with chronic coronary stenosis.,"<jats:p>We have previously demonstrated that the beneficial effect of cardioselective beta-blockade on exercise-induced ischemia is due entirely to negative chronotropism. Therefore we studied the effect of a new bradycardiac agent (UL-FS 49) in 10 dogs with chronic coronary artery stenosis produced by an ameroid constrictor. Regional myocardial function (sonomicrometers, wall thickness) and blood flow (microspheres) were measured during a control treadmill exercise bout and an identical run 3 hr later after the administration of UL-FS 49 (1.0 mg/kg iv). In the control run, heart rate increased from 114 +/- 20 to 230 +/- 19 beats/min and systolic wall thickening (%WT) in the poststenotic myocardium decreased from 23.3 +/- 5.2% at rest to 9.3 +/- 5.0%, a 60% reduction. Subendocardial blood flow in the ischemic area decreased from 1.04 +/- 0.30 to 0.55 +/- 0.40 ml/min/g, blood flow per beat decreased from 9.1 X 10(-3) to 2.5 X 10(-3) ml/g, and mean transmural flow failed to increase (1.06 +/- 0.30 vs 1.08 +/- 0.39 ml/min/g). During exercise with UL-FS 49, heart rate increased from 89 +/- 10 to only 139 +/- 10 beats/min. End-diastolic left ventricular pressure was increased compared with that during the control run (35.7 +/- 3.0 vs 28.9 +/- 5.5 mm Hg) but left ventricular peak systolic pressure and dP/dt were unchanged. %WT in the ischemic zone did not change significantly during exercise with UL-FS 49 (23.3 +/- 7.9% at rest, 21.5 +/- 8.4% during the run), and in the nonischemic zone it increased to the same extent as during the control run.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</jats:p>",0

The effect was not seen when cysteamine‐HCl was administered at 600 or 1200 mg/kg of the diet. In Experiment 2 broiler chicks administered cysteamine‐HCl at 1800 mg/kg of the diet had an increased incidence of gizzard ulceration and decreased growth performance.

Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blocks induction of IL-1 beta mRNA in mice brain in response to peripheral LPS,"<jats:p> To test the possibility that the vagus nerve is involved in the communication between the immune system and the brain, we injected sham-operated and vagotomized mice with physiological saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 400 micrograms/kg ip). Vagotomy attenuated LPS-induced depression of general activity measured 2 h after treatment but did not alter the increase in plasma levels of IL-1 beta in response to LPS. In addition, vagotomy abrogated the LPS-induced increase in the levels of transcripts for IL-1 beta, as determined by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription, in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, but not in the pituitary of vagotomized mice. This relationship between the effects of vagotomy on the behavioral effects of LPS and the LPS-induced brain expression of IL-1 beta mRNA indicates that vagal afferent fibers play a prominent role in the pathways of communication between the immune system and the brain. </jats:p>",0

Regulation of excitability and plasticity by endocannabinoids and PKA in developing hippocampus,"<jats:p>
            The activity-dependent strengthening and weakening of synaptic transmission are hypothesized to be the basis of not only memory and learning but also the refinement of neural circuits during development. Here we report that, in the developing CA1 area of the hippocampus, endocannabinoid (eCB)-mediated heterosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission is associated with PKA-mediated homosynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP). This form of LTD was dominant at postnatal days 2–10 (P2–P10), attenuated during development, and finally disappeared in the mature hippocampus. Heterosynaptic LTD of excitatory postsynaptic currents in the developing hippocampus was expressed presynaptically, spread to neighboring neurons, and was mediated by eCBs. Heterosynaptic LTD of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials was associated with a decrease in fiber volley amplitude with a similar time course. Depression of fiber volleys was blocked by K

            channel blockers, suggesting the involvement of the decrease in presynaptic excitability in heterosynaptic LTD. In the P2–P5 hippocampus, eCBs also attenuate LTP and fiber volleys in homosynaptic pathways and help to prevent too much excitability in the neonatal hippocampus where the GABAergic system is poorly developed and even excitatory. In the hippocampus older than P6 (P &gt; 6), however, LTP is protected from eCB-mediated depression by PKA activated at presynaptic sites by high-frequency stimulation, serving to highlight PKA-mediated LTP by weakening inactive synapses even in adjacent cells. Thus, eCBs and PKA make synapses plastic without changing excitability homeostasis in the developing hippocampus.

Olfactory Deficits Cause Anxiety-Like Behaviors in Mice,"<jats:p>Anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent fear in the absence of immediate threat and represent the most common psychiatric diseases, with an estimated 28% lifetime prevalence worldwide (Kessler et al., 2010). While symptoms of anxiety are typically evoked by sensory stimuli, it is unknown whether sensory deficits contribute to the development of anxiety disorders. Here we examine the effect of defined genetic mutations that compromise the function of the olfactory system on the development of anxiety-like behaviors in mice. We show that the functional inactivation of the main olfactory epithelium, but not the vomeronasal organ, causes elevated levels of anxiety. Anxiety-like behaviors are also observed in mice with a monoclonal nose, that are able to detect and discriminate odors but in which the patterns of odor-evoked neural activity are perturbed. In these mice, plasma corticosterone levels are elevated, suggesting that olfactory deficits can lead to chronic stress. These results demonstrate a central role for olfactory sensory cues in modulating anxiety in mice.</jats:p>",0
Cortical spreading depression and gene regulation: Relevance to migraine,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) may be the underlying mechanism of migraine aura. The role of CSD in initiating a migraine headache remains to be determined, but it might involve specific changes in gene expression in the brain. To examine these changes, four episodes of CSD at 5‐minute intervals were induced in the mouse brain by application of 300mM KCl, and gene expression was examined 2 hours later using cDNA array and reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. Controls consisted of groups that received anesthesia only, attachment of recording electrodes only, and application of 0.9% NaCl. Of the over 1,180 genes examined in our experiments, those consistently regulated by CSD included vasoactive peptides; the vasodilator atrial natriuretic peptide was induced by CSD, while the vasoconstrictor neuropeptide Y was downregulated. Other genes specifically regulated by CSD were involved in oxidative stress responses (major prion protein, glutathione‐S‐transferase‐5, and apolipoprotein E). L‐type calcium channel mRNA was upregulated. In summary, CSD regulates genes that are intrinsic to its propagation, that identify accompanying vascular responses as a potential source of pain, and that protect against its potential pathological consequences. We believe these observations have strong relevance to the mechanisms of migraine and its outcomes.</jats:p>",0

Effect of Long-Term Cyclophosphamide Treatment on T and B Lymphocytes in Normal Guinea Pigs,"<jats:p>The effect of long-term repeated cyclophosphamide administration at low doses on T and B lymphocyte levels in the blood, lymph nodes and thymus of the guinea pig has been studied. A significant depletion of B cell levels occurred in the blood and the lymph nodes. Although there was evidence of depression of T cell levels in both blood and thymus, these changes were not statistically significant, except in the case of total T lymphocyte levels in the blood in one experiment. It is suggested that differences in sensitivity of T and B cells to cyclophosphamide may be related to differences in proliferative turnover and in their capacitv to repair damage to DNA.</jats:p>",0

Effect of a synthetic progestin on ventilatory response to hypoxia in anesthetized rats,"<jats:p> Effects on ventilatory responses to progressive isocapnic hypoxia of a synthetic potent progestin, chlormadinone acetate (CMA), were determined in the halothane-anesthetized male rat. Ventilation during the breathing of hyperoxic gas was largely unaffected by treatment with CMA when carotid chemoreceptor afferents were kept intact. The sensitivity to hypoxia evaluated by hyperbolic regression analysis of the response curve did not differ between the control and CMA groups. The reduction of ventilation after bilateral section of the carotid sinus nerve (CSN) in hyperoxia was less severe in CMA-treated than in untreated animals. Furthermore, the CMA-treated rats showed a larger increase in ventilation during the hypoxia test and a lower PO2 break point for ventilatory depression. Inhibition of hypoxic ventilatory depression by CMA persisted even after the denervation of CSN. We conclude that exogenous progestin likely protects regulatory mechanism(s) for respiration against hypoxic depression through a stimulating action independent of carotid chemoreceptor afferents and without a change in the sensitivity of the ventilatory response to hypoxia. </jats:p>",0

Actions of microiontophoretically applied ibotenate on cat spinal interneurones,"<jats:p> Microiontophoretic applications of ibotenate, an amino acid analogue of glutamate, evoked biphasic responses from single dorsal horn interneurones of the cat spinal cord, i.e., an initial increase in the firing rate followed by a sustained depression of spontaneous firing. A reduced cell sensitivity to excitatory amino acids or peripheral field stimulation was also found during the ibotenate-induced depression. These effects were not produced by glutamate, quisqualate, or kainate, although occasional transient reductions of spontaneous cell firing were observed after application of glutamate. It is suggested that ibotenate might act on inhibitory as well as excitatory receptors of cat spinal interneurones. </jats:p>",0

Permanent Relief from Intermittent Cold Stress-Induced Fibromyalgia-Like Abnormal Pain by Repeated Intrathecal Administration of Antidepressants,"<jats:sec><jats:title>Background:</jats:title><jats:p> Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic widespread pain, which is often refractory to conventional painkillers. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that antidepressants are effective in treating FM pain. We previously established a mouse model of FM-like pain, induced by intermittent cold stress (ICS). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p> In this study, we find that ICS exposure causes a transient increase in plasma corticosterone concentration, but not in anxiety or depression-like behaviors. A single intrathecal injection of an antidepressant, such as milnacipran, amitriptyline, mianserin or paroxetine, had an acute analgesic effect on ICS-induced thermal hyperalgesia at post-stress day 1 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, repeated daily antidepressant treatments during post-stress days 1-5 gradually reversed the reduction in thermal pain threshold, and this recovery was maintained for at least 7 days after the final treatment. In addition, relief from mechanical allodynia, induced by ICS exposure, was also observed at day 9 after the cessation of antidepressant treatment. In contrast, the intravenous administration of these antidepressants at conventional doses failed to provide relief. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title><jats:p> These results suggest that the repetitive intrathecal administration of antidepressants permanently cures ICS-induced FM pain in mice. </jats:p></jats:sec>",0
Definition of a metal-dependent/Li(+)-inhibited phosphomonoesterase protein family based upon a conserved three-dimensional core structure.,"<jats:p>Inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, inositol monophosphate phosphatase, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase share a sequence motif, Asp-Pro-(Ile or Leu)-Asp-(Gly or Ser)-(Thr or Ser), that has been shown by crystallographic and mutagenesis studies to bind metal ions and participate in catalysis. We compared the six alpha-carbon coordinates of this motif from the crystal structures of these three phosphatases and found that they are superimposable with rms deviations ranging from 0.27 to 0.60 A. Remarkably, when these proteins were aligned by this motif a common core structure emerged, defined by five alpha-helices and 11 beta-strands comprising 155 residues having rms deviations ranging from 1.48 to 2.66 A. We used the superimposed structures to align the sequences within the common core, and a distant relationship was observed suggesting a common ancestor. The common core was used to align the sequences of several other proteins that share significant similarity to inositol monophosphate phosphatase, including proteins encoded by fungal qa-X and qutG, bacterial suhB and cysQ (identical to amtA), and yeast met22 (identical to hal2). Evolutionary comparison of the core sequences indicate that five distinct branches exist within this family. These proteins share metal-dependent/Li(+)-sensitive phosphomonoesterase activity, and each predicted tree branch exhibits unique substrate specificity. Thus, these proteins define an ancient structurally conserved family involved in diverse metabolic pathways including inositol signaling, gluconeogenesis, sulfate assimilation, and possibly quinone metabolism. Furthermore, we suggest that this protein family identifies candidate enzymes to account for both the therapeutic and toxic actions of Li+ as it is used in patients treated for manic depressive disease.</jats:p>",0

Anesthetic Techniques for Fetal Surgery,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>

            <jats:title>Background:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Use of high-dose inhalational anesthesia during open fetal surgery may induce maternal–fetal hemodynamic instability and fetal myocardial depression. The authors’ preliminary human retrospective study demonstrated less fetal bradycardia and left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lower dose desflurane supplemented with propofol and remifentanil IV anesthesia (SIVA). In this animal study, the authors compare maternal–fetal effects of high-dose desflurane anesthesia (HD-DES) and SIVA.</jats:p>

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Of 26 instrumented midgestational ewes, data from 11 animals exposed to both SIVA and HD-DES in random sequences and six animals exposed to HD-DES while maternal normotension was maintained were analyzed.

            <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Compared with SIVA, HD-DES resulted in significant maternal hypotension (mean arterial pressure difference, 19.53 mmHg; 95% CI, 17.6–21.4; <jats:italic toggle=""yes"">P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.0001), fetal acidosis (pH 7.11 <jats:italic toggle=""yes"">vs</jats:italic>. 7.24 at 150 min, <jats:italic toggle=""yes"">P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001), and decreased uterine blood flow.

SOD prevents damage and attenuates eicosanoid release in a rabbit model of necrotizing enterocolitis,"<jats:p> Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) was produced in anesthetized rabbits by transmural injection of intestinal loops with an acidified solution of casein and calcium gluconate, mimicking the luminal milieu of afflicted neonates. Intravenous infusion of superoxide dismutase (SOD) 15 min after NEC induction prevented intestinal damage. In ex vivo perfused intestinal loops, we determined the sites of eicosanoid release and their contribution to the vascular effects of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) in damaged and SOD-salvaged intestine. The vascular effluent was the primary site of stimulated eicosanoid release. The vascular responses to fMLP (vasoconstriction) and PAF (vasodilation) were not altered by SOD, although vascular resistance was higher in the SOD group. SOD treatment attenuated 1) transmural fluid shifts in ex vivo perfused intestinal preparations, an index of vascular permeability, 2) fMLP-induced prostaglandin E2, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) release, and 3) PAF-induced release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and LTB4. Stimulated thromboxane B2 release was not altered by SOD. Thus NEC can be established by a luminal insult that causes local generation of free radicals and exaggerated release of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. </jats:p>",0

STUDIES ON LYMPHOID ACTIVITY,"<jats:p>It has been shown that resistance to transplanted cancer follows stimulation of the lymphoid tissue when the stimulation is induced by either heat or small doses of x-rays. In this paper we have attempted to determine whether the degree of immunity had a quantitative relation to the amount of the stimulation. Fortunately, the two methods at our disposal give stimulation of markedly different characters. The small dose of x-rays gives a sluggish lymphoid cell reaction of short duration with a definite latent period between the treatment and the evidence of marked stimulation, while after heat a short period of depression is followed by a sharp stimulation continuing over a much longer period. The cancer inoculation into groups of mice made immediately after exposure to x-rays shows little resistance, while the inoculation made at the height of the stimulation phase shows a definite increase in the immunity. Animals inoculated with cancer immediately after the heat treatment exhibit a pronounced immunity, but not so marked as that shown when the inoculation is made at the height of the stimulation.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>The amount of resistance shown when the cancer inoculation is made at the height of the moderately stimulating effect following exposure to x-rays, is much less than that seen when the inoculation is made at the height of the heat effect when the degree of stimulation is much greater. When the lymphocytosis sets in after the tumor graft is established only a slight effect is noted. All these results together are taken to indicate that the degree of immunity is dependent on the amount of lymphoid stimulation existing either at the time of or following soon after the cancer inoculation.</jats:p>",0

Time course and calcium dependence of transmitter release at a single ribbon synapse,"<jats:p>
            At the first synapse in the auditory pathway, the receptor potential of mechanosensory hair cells is converted into a firing pattern in auditory nerve fibers. For the accurate coding of timing and intensity of sound signals, transmitter release at this synapse must occur with the highest precision. To measure directly the transfer characteristics of the hair cell afferent synapse, we implemented simultaneous whole-cell recordings from mammalian inner hair cells (IHCs) and auditory nerve fiber terminals that typically receive input from a single ribbon synapse. During a 1-s IHC depolarization, the synaptic response depressed &gt;90%, representing the main source for adaptation in the auditory nerve. Synaptic depression was slightly affected by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor desensitization; however, it was mostly caused by reduced vesicular release.

Translational profiling of hypocretin neurons identifies candidate molecules for sleep regulation,"<jats:p>Hypocretin (orexin; Hcrt)-containing neurons of the hypothalamus are essential for the normal regulation of sleep and wake behaviors and have been implicated in feeding, anxiety, depression, and reward. The absence of these neurons causes narcolepsy in humans and model organisms. However, little is known about the molecular phenotype of these cells; previous attempts at comprehensive profiling had only limited sensitivity or were inaccurate. We generated a Hcrt translating ribosome affinity purification (bacTRAP) line for comprehensive translational profiling of all ribosome-bound transcripts in these neurons in vivo. From this profile, we identified &gt;6000 transcripts detectably expressed above background and 188 transcripts that are highly enriched in these neurons, including all known markers of the cells. Blinded analysis of in situ hybridization databases suggests that ∼60% of these are expressed in a Hcrt marker-like pattern. Fifteen of these were confirmed with double labeling and microscopy, including the transcription factor <jats:italic>Lhx9</jats:italic>. Ablation of this gene results in a &gt;30% loss specifically of Hcrt neurons, without a general disruption of hypothalamic development. Polysomnography and activity monitoring revealed a profound hypersomnolence in these mice. These data provide an in-depth and accurate profile of Hcrt neuron gene expression and suggest that <jats:italic>Lhx9</jats:italic> may be important for specification or survival of a subset of these cells.</jats:p>",0

Adrenergic and Serotoninergic Mechanisms in Gastric Secretion in Rats,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> The influence of adrenergic and serotoninergic mechanisms on gastric secretion was investigated using fistula‐ and pylorus‐ligated rats. Secretion was increased by the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor α‐methyltyrosine. This effect could be reversed by L‐DOPA. 6‐hydroxydopamine also increased gastric output. The tryptophane hydroxylase inhibitor <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‐chlorophenylalanine reduced gastric output and abolished the increase in gastric secretion induced by α‐methyltyrosine.</jats:p><jats:p>The antisecretory effect of serotonin was found to be antagonized by α‐methyltyrosine. Pre‐treatment with 6‐hydroxydopamine also diminished the anti‐secretory effect of serotonin.</jats:p><jats:p>The results indicate the possibility of the existence of an inhibiting peripheral adrenergic tonus in the regulation of gastric secretion in rats. Furthermore it is suggested, that the anti‐secretory effect of large doses of serotonin may be due to displacement of noradrenaline in catecholamine neurones. Finally the question is raised whether a balance between serotoninergic and adrenergic mechanisms in the regulation of gastric secretion may exist in rats.</jats:p>",0
Protein kinase C modulates exogenous acetylcholine current in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The modulation of acetylcholine‐activated current (I<jats:sub>ACh</jats:sub>) by protein kinase C (PKC) was studied in Xenopus laevis oocytes microinjected with either mRNA extracted from C2C12 myotubes (C2C12 mRNA) or RNAs encoding murine αβγδ subunits of the nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR). Voltage‐clamped oocytes were treated for 90 sec with 12‐0‐tetradecanoylphorbol‐13‐acetate (TPA, 300 nM), a potent PKC activator. Transient increase in the amplitude and acceleration in the decay of I<jats:sub>ACh</jats:sub> were invariably observed within minutes of TPA application, and were independent of extracellular Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> concentration. Both parameters recovered to control within 20–30 min; then a slight depression of I<jats:sub>ACh</jats:sub> developed. By this time, an initial PKC down regulation was observed. At the peak of TPA‐induced potentiation, dose‐response relations suggested an increased binding affinity of nAChR for the neurotransmitter. 4a‐phorbol 12,13‐didecanoate (300 nM), a biologically inactive analogue of TPA, did not affect I<jats:sub>ACh</jats:sub>, while staurosporine (5–10 μM), a potent inhibitor of PKC activity, suppressed the action of TPA on I<jats:sub>ACh</jats:sub>. In oocytes co‐injected with C2C12 mRNA and with rat brain mRNA, I<jats:sub>ACh</jats:sub> was potentiated by 5‐hydroxytryptamine (10 μM), whose receptors are coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The nAChR‐channel activity in cell‐attached patches increased when TPA was applied to the oocytes. In 50% of the oocytes examined, a sustained depression of the single channel activity followed. We conclude that in Xenopus oocytes an endogenous PKC system regulates the function of embryonic‐type muscle nAChRs. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",0

Barbiturates depress vagal motor pathway to ferret trachea at ganglia,"<jats:p> To determine which site in the vagal motor pathway to airway smooth muscle is most sensitive to depression by barbiturates, we recorded isometric muscle tension in vitro and stimulated the vagal motor pathway at four different sites before and after exposure to barbiturates. In isolated tracheal rings from ferrets, we stimulated muscarinic receptors in the neuromuscular junction by exogenous acetylcholine, postganglionic nerve fibers by electrical fluid stimulation, and the postsynaptic membrane in ganglia by 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP). We also developed a tracheal nerve-muscle preparation to stimulate preganglionic fibers in the vagus nerve electrically. Activation of ganglia by DMPP or by vagus nerve stimulation was depressed by barbiturates at 10-fold lower concentrations than those depressing the activation of postganglionic nerves or the neuromuscular junction. These findings suggest that the postsynaptic membrane in parasympathetic ganglia is the site in the vagal motor pathway most sensitive to depression by barbiturates. </jats:p>",0

Ciliated cells were observed on the dorsal surface of the tongue in all embryos which exceeded 18 mm in crown-rump length. The presence of a foramen caecum was observed in 18 (51%) cadavers from 35 human adults. Several circumvallate papillae were found in a 10-mm-deep foramen caecum on the side adjacent to the anterior two thirds of the tongue.

A Postsynaptic Interaction between Dopamine D<sub>1</sub>and NMDA Receptors Promotes Presynaptic Inhibition in the Rat Nucleus Accumbens via Adenosine Release,"<jats:p>The mechanism underlying dopamine D<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>receptor-mediated attenuation of glutamatergic synaptic input to nucleus accumbens (NAcc) neurons was investigated in slices of rat forebrain, using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. The depression by dopamine of EPSCs evoked by single-shock cortical stimulation was stimulus-dependent. Synaptic activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors was critical for this effect, because dopamine-induced EPSC depressions were blocked by the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist<jats:sc>d</jats:sc>/<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5). Application of NMDA also depressed the EPSC, and both this effect and the dopamine depressions were blocked by the A<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), implicating adenosine release in the EPSC depression. A<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>receptor agonists also depressed EPSCs by a presynaptic action, causing increased paired-pulse facilitation, but this was insensitive to AP5. Activation of D<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>receptors enhanced both postsynaptic inward currents evoked by NMDA application and the isolated NMDA receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission. The biochemical processes underlying the dopamine-induced EPSC depression did not involve either protein kinase A or the production of cAMP and its metabolites, because this effect was resistant to the protein kinase inhibitors H89 and H7 and the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram. We conclude that activation of postsynaptic D<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>receptors enhances the synaptic activation of NMDA receptors in nucleus accumbens neurons, thereby promoting a transsynaptic feedback inhibition of glutamatergic synaptic transmission via release of adenosine. Unusually for D<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>receptors, this phenomenon occurs independently of adenylyl cyclase stimulation. This process may contribute to the locomotor stimulant action of dopaminergic agents in the NAcc.</jats:p>",0

Effect of lidocaine and quinidine on steady-state characteristics and recovery kinetics of (dV/dt)max in guinea pig ventricular myocardium.,"<jats:p>We studied the effects of quinidine and lidocaine on the steady-state relationship between membrane potential and the maximum rate of rise of the action potential, (dV/dt)max, and on the recovery kinetics of (dV/dt)max in guinea pig papillary muscles. The steady-state relationships were determined in fibers stimulated at 0.2/sec and depolarized with KCl. Recovery kinetics were determined at various resting membrane potentials by assessing (dV/dt)max in progressively earlier premature action potentials. Lidocaine caused a dose-dependent decrease in (dV/dt)max, shifted the curve defining the steady-state relationship along the voltage axis in the direction of more negative potentials, and slowed the recovery kinetics of (dV/dt)max. Quinidine caused a dose-dependent decrease in (dV/dt)max but did not alter the shape of the curves defining either the steady-state relationship or the recovery kinetics of (dV/dt)max. Both drugs depressed membrane responsiveness as determined in premature action potentials originating from incompletely repolarized fibers. Our study indicates that the mechanisms whereby quinidine and lidocaine influence (dV/dt)max are different. It is possible that this difference may underlie some of the differences in the clinical effects of these two drugs.</jats:p>",0

Loss of inhibition precedes delayed spontaneous seizures in the hippocampus after tetanic electrical stimulation,"<jats:p> 1. The electrophysiological consequences of a ""continuous"" hippocampal stimulation protocol consisting of 10-s-long stimulus trains administered every 11 s for 90 min to the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized rats were studied. During the period of stimulation, there was an initial phase with tonic discharges occurring every 1-2 min followed by a secondary phase in which there were well-demarcated recurrent clonic seizures. 2. At the end of the 90 min stimulation period, 7 out of a total of 14 animals studied show epileptiform activity that lasted one-half hour. The other half show disappearance of epileptiform activity within 2 min after terminating the stimulus. In all the animals a quiescent period then followed. In 11 of the animals studied, spontaneous seizures reappeared after the quiescent period had been present for several hours. 3. A paired-pulse method that in previous studies had been shown to reflect the functional state of GABAergic inhibition was employed. Paired-pulse depression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was measured before administration of stimulus trains, in the quiescent period following the trains, and during and after spontaneous seizures. By comparing indices of maximal inhibition under the various experimental conditions, estimates of the relative amount of inhibition lost could be made. 4. All animals showed reduction of paired-pulse depression in the quiescent period following stimulation when compared with prestimulation values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </jats:p>",0

Inhibition of corticosteroid production by sodium pentobarbitone in rat adrenocortical preparations,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
        <jats:p>It is possible that some of the effects of sodium pentobarbitone on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in the intact animal may be attributable to direct actions on the adrenal cortex. The effects of the barbiturate on steroid production by rat adrenal preparations <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> have therefore been examined. In zona glomerulosa cells, pentobarbitone inhibited basal steroid production in a dose-related fashion. For aldosterone and corticosterone, the doses required for 50% inhibition of production (IC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>) were 1·2 mmol pentobarbitone/l and 3·7 mmol/l respectively. Steroidogenesis was inhibited at lower levels of pentobarbitone in the presence of 1 nmol ACTH/l (IC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> = 0·5 mmol pentobarbitone/l for aldosterone and 2·2 mmol/l for corticosterone). In zona fasciculata/reticularis cells, production of corticosterone was similarly reduced with an IC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> of 2·8 mmol pentobarbitone/l for basal production and 1·3 mmol/l for ACTH-stimulated production. The dose-related increases in corticosterone production produced by ACTH (0·1–1000 pmol/l) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (0·1–1·0 mmol/l) were also eliminated in the presence of 2 mmol pentobarbitone/l. The effects of pentobarbitone (1–4 mmol/l) on the production of pregnenolone and deoxycorticosterone (DOC) were also studied. In zona fasciculata/reticularis cells, the responses of both pregnenolone and DOC were bell-shaped with increases at 1 mmol pentobarbitone/l, which fell back to control levels at 4 mmol pentobarbitone/l. Stimulation of DOC, accompanied by decreases in aldosterone and corticosterone production, was also seen in zona glomerulosa cells at 1 mmol pentobarbitone/l.</jats:p>
        <jats:p>The effect of 1 mmol pentobarbitone/l on the conversion of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (5-cholestene-3β,22(R)-diol), pregnenolone, progesterone and DOC to corticosterone and aldosterone by zona glomerulosa preparations was studied. There was a comparable reduction in the conversion of these precursors (2 μmol/l) to aldosterone with yields decreased to 20–30% of those found in the absence of pentobarbitone. The dose required for 50% reduction of the conversion of progesterone (2 μmol/l) to aldosterone was 0·55 mmol pentobarbitone/l and for corticosterone the dose was 1·75 mmol pentobarbitone/l.</jats:p>
        <jats:p>The results obtained show that pentobarbitone is an effective inhibitor of corticosteroid biosynthesis in rat adrenal cells, and suggest that its effects are brought about by inhibition of cytochrome P450-mediated hydroxylations.</jats:p>

Activity-dependent depression of mechanosensory discharge in Aplysia,"<jats:p> 1. Inhibition of action potential discharge in Aplysia mechanosensory neurons after noxious stimulation has not been described previously. The present studies investigated depressive effects of prolonged noxious stimulation and repetitive intracellular activation on the number and latency of action potentials evoked by test stimuli applied to the tail or the nerve innervating the tail. Action potential discharge was monitored in the somata of mechanonociceptors in the pleural ganglia. 2. Repeated brief pinches delivered at 5-s intervals to a sensory neuron's receptive field on the tail initially caused intense activation (10-25 spikes recorded in the soma) followed by a progressive decrease or ""wind-down"" of spike number during subsequent pinches. 3. Repeated application to the tail of noxious shock that caused intense activation of sensory neurons (10-22 spikes during the initial shock) produced progressive wind-down of discharge similar to that produced by repeated tail pinch. However, sensory neurons that showed lower activation (1-9 spikes) to the same shock displayed wind-up of discharge during the 10 shocks. These results suggested that prolonged, intense activation depresses subsequent action potential discharge. 4. Changes in the time required for spikes evoked in the tail to reach the central soma were used as an indicator of changes in the excitability and/or conduction velocity of peripheral branches. Repeated pinch within a sensory neuron's receptive field caused an increase in the latency of discharge elicited by test shocks within the receptive field that lasted &gt; or = 10 min. Repetitive intracellular stimulation of the sensory neuron soma caused a similar increase in latency. 5. Repetitive soma activation decreased the number of spikes evoked 10 s later by a test shock in the sensory neuron's receptive field, indicating that spike activity depresses the initiation and/or conduction of spikes in peripheral branches. Surprisingly, repeated pinch to the receptive field caused no significant change in the number of spikes evoked by the same test shock. This difference suggests that tail pinch produces concomitant facilitatory effects that oppose the depressive effects of intense spike activity. 6. Depressive effects of repeated pinch and repetitive soma activation were expressed in the axon between the receptive field and the CNS. Spikes evoked by brief test shocks delivered to the nerve containing the axon of the recorded sensory neuron showed a transient increase in latency (perhaps due to a decrease in conduction velocity) after either procedure. Repeated pinch, but not repetitive soma activation, also caused an increase in spike threshold in the nerve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </jats:p>",0

The class I agents other than lidocaine were almost uniformly effective in terminating the arrhythmia (disopyramide in six of seven dogs, propafenone in six of six, flecainide in seven of seven, and SC-40230 in seven of seven). Termination was preceded by a marked increase in cycle length (ranging from +78% with propafenone to +55% with disopyramide), but with the exception of disopyramide, class I agents did not significantly shorten the excitable gap. With disopyramide the gap decreased from 49 +/- 3% to 28 +/- 3% of the cycle length. With no class I agent did the wavelength of effective refractoriness increase to approach the cycle length of the arrhythmia. Lidocaine, used as a negative control, terminated the reentry in one dog with modest prolongation of the cycle length. Terminations with class I agents correlated with depression of conduction rather than prolongation of refractoriness. In contrast with class I agents, D-sotalol prolonged the cycle length minimally (+10%) and terminated the arrhythmia in six of seven dogs. It decreased the excitable gap from 42 +/- 4% to 26 +/- 6% of the cycle, but it still did not cause the wavelength of effective refractoriness to equal the cycle length. Terminations by D-sotalol seemed to result from either failure of the lateral boundaries of the circus path or reflection within the path.</jats:p>",0

L-Type Calcium Channels Mediate Mechanically Induced Bone Formation In Vivo,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Cell and tissue culture studies suggest that the long-lasting (L-type) voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) play a role in the signaling cascade in bone cells after mechanical loading. We investigated whether the L-type VSCC mediates mechanically induced bone formation in vivo using two L-type VSCC antagonists verapamil and nifedipine. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: control group (Veh), two verapamil-treated groups (20 mg/kg, Vera-L; 100 mg/kg, Vera-H), and two nifedipine-treated groups (20 mg/kg, Nife-L; 100 mg/kg, Nife-H). One bout of mechanical loading was applied to the right tibia 90 minutes after oral administration of verapamil or 30 minutes after oral administration of nifedipine. Mechanical loading increased mineralizing surface (MS/bone surface [BS]), mineral apposition rate (MAR), and bone formation rate (BFR/BS) on the endocortical surface in loaded tibias of control animals compared with nonloaded (left) tibias. Verapamil and nifedipine suppressed the load-induced increase in BFR/BS observed in vehicle-treated controls by 56–61% (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and 56–74% (p &amp;lt; 0.01), respectively. Yet, significant differences in MS/BS and BFR/BS between right and left limbs were found in verapamil- and nifedipine-treated animals, indicating that the treatments did not completely abolish load-induced bone formation. This study shows that blocking the L-type calcium channel in vivo substantially suppresses the mechanically induced increase in bone formation that normally would occur and suggests that the L-type calcium channel mediates mechanically induced bone adaptation in vivo.</jats:p>",0
Body temperature depression and peripheral heat loss accompany the metabolic and ventilatory responses to hypoxia in low and high altitude birds,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The objectives of this study were to compare the thermoregulatory,metabolic and ventilatory responses to hypoxia of the high altitude bar-headed goose with low altitude waterfowl. All birds were found to reduce body temperature (Tb) during hypoxia, by up to 1–1.5°C in severe hypoxia. During prolonged hypoxia, Tb stabilized at a new lower temperature. A regulated increase in heat loss contributed to Tb depression as reflected by increases in bill surface temperatures (up to 5°C) during hypoxia. Bill warming required peripheral chemoreceptor inputs, since vagotomy abolished this response to hypoxia. Tb depression could still occur without bill warming, however, because vagotomized birds reduced Tb as much as intact birds. Compared to both greylag geese and pekin ducks, bar-headed geese required more severe hypoxia to initiate Tb depression and heat loss from the bill. However, when Tb depression or bill warming were expressed relative to arterial O2 concentration (rather than inspired O2) all species were similar; this suggests that enhanced O2 loading,rather than differences in thermoregulatory control centres, reduces Tb depression during hypoxia in bar-headed geese. Correspondingly, bar-headed geese maintained higher rates of metabolism during severe hypoxia (7% inspired O2), but this was only partly due to differences in Tb. Time domains of the hypoxic ventilatory response also appeared to differ between bar-headed geese and low altitude species. Overall, our results suggest that birds can adjust peripheral heat dissipation to facilitate Tb depression during hypoxia,and that bar-headed geese minimize Tb and metabolic depression as a result of evolutionary adaptations that enhance O2transport.</jats:p>",0

Effects of oxytocin on recollections of maternal care and closeness,"<jats:p>Although the infant–caregiver attachment bond is critical to survival, little is known about the biological mechanisms supporting attachment representations in humans. Oxytocin plays a key role in attachment bond formation and maintenance in animals and thus could be expected to affect attachment representations in humans. To investigate this possibility, we administered 24 IU intranasal oxytocin to healthy male adults in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover designed study and then assessed memories of childhood maternal care and closeness—two features of the attachment bond. We found that the effects of oxytocin were moderated by the attachment representations people possess, with less anxiously attached individuals remembering their mother as more caring and close after oxytocin (vs. placebo) but more anxiously attached individuals remembering their mother as less caring and close after oxytocin (vs. placebo). These data contrast with the popular notion that oxytocin has broad positive effects on social perception and are more consistent with the animal literature, which emphasizes oxytocin's role in encoding social memories and linking those memories to the reward value of the social stimulus.</jats:p>",0
The MK2/3 cascade regulates AMPAR trafficking and cognitive flexibility,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The interplay between long-term potentiation and long-term depression (LTD) is thought to be involved in learning and memory formation. One form of LTD expressed in the hippocampus is initiated by the activation of the group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Importantly, mGluRs have been shown to be critical for acquisition of new memories and for reversal learning, processes that are thought to be crucial for cognitive flexibility. Here we provide evidence that MAPK-activated protein kinases 2 and 3 (MK2/3) regulate neuronal spine morphology, synaptic transmission and plasticity. Furthermore, mGluR-LTD is impaired in the hippocampus of MK2/3 double knockout (DKO) mice, an observation that is mirrored by deficits in endocytosis of GluA1 subunits. Consistent with compromised mGluR-LTD, MK2/3 DKO mice have distinctive deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial reversal learning. These novel findings demonstrate that the MK2/3 cascade plays a strategic role in controlling synaptic plasticity and cognition.</jats:p>",0

Protection from arabinofuranosylcytosine and n-mustard-induced myelotoxicity using hemoregulatory peptide pGlu-Glu-Asp-Cys-Lys monomer and dimer,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>We have previously shown that the synthetic peptide pGlu-Glu-Asp-Cys- Lys (pEEDCK monomer) inhibits the cytostatic drug-induced proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells CFU-S. Keeping CFU-S quiescent by pEEDCK treatment renders them insensitive to cycle-specific cytostatic drugs and leads to reduced toxicity. Here we show that pEEDCK application during repeated (twice) administration of clinically relevant (nonlethal) 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) doses reduced the percentage of CFU-S in S-phase from 60%-70% to 25%-30% and led to a sustained stem cell number in the bone marrow (BM), whereas unprotected mice had lost about 75% of their CFU-S population. Owing to its cysteine content, the pEEDCK monomer is easily oxidized. The resulting dimer (pEEDCK)2 is a potent stimulator of hematopoiesis. As we show, it can be used for postchemotherapy acceleration of hematologic recovery, similar to the use of recombinant hematopoietic growth factors. A single injection of 30 micrograms/kg pEEDCK monomer to mice 2 hours before the second Ara-C injection retarded onset of neutropenia (by 2 to 3 days) and improved recovery after depression. The quantitative degree of neutropenia was not changed. Postchemotherapy (Ara-C administered twice, followed by N-mustard) infusion of the stimulatory (pEEDCK)2 dimer (1.4 micrograms/kg/d) produced a 4.6-fold increase of progenitor levels (6.7 CFU-GM/1,000 BM cells v 1.45 CFU-GM/1,000 in normal mice) 2 days after the end of the cytostatic treatment when CFU- GM were not detectable in unprotected mice. This increase was followed after several days by strongly elevated granulocyte counts, which remained high for approximately 1 week. Up to 75% of the peripheral leukocytes were mature polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) during this phase. Ara-C (twice) and monomer treatment as above followed by dimer infusion resulted in the complete protection of hematopoiesis. Mice treated with the protective pEEDCK monomer plus stimulatory dimer did not develop the leukocyte depression noted in unprotected animals. The inhibitory monomer appears to keep the stem cell population numerically and qualitatively intact, thus providing optimum target cell conditions for the subsequent stimulator (dimer) treatment. Our results show that the hemoregulatory peptide monomer and dimer can be used for improving the hematologic status of mice treated with clinically relevant doses of cytostatic drugs (antimetabolite and alkylating, alone and in combination). Combining both peptides can prevent occurrence of neutropenia completely. Both peptides can be obtained easily by chemical synthesis and are also active on human cells. They are thus highly promising candidates for application as multilevel hemoprotectors in cancer chemotherapy.</jats:p>",0
