"Genome Characterization of a Pathogenic Porcine Rotavirus B Strain Identified in Buryat Republic, Russia in 2015","<jats:p>An outbreak of enteric disease of unknown etiology with 60% morbidity and 8% mortality in weaning piglets occurred in November 2015 on a farm in Buryat Republic, Russia. Metagenomic sequencing revealed the presence of rotavirus B in feces from diseased piglets while no other pathogens were identified. Clinical disease was reproduced in experimentally infected piglets, yielding the 11 RVB gene segments for strain Buryat15, with an RVB genotype constellation of G12-P[4]-I13-R4-C4-M4-A8-N10-T4-E4-H7. This genotype constellation has also been identified in the United States. While the Buryat15 VP7 protein lacked unique amino acid differences in the predicted neutralizing epitopes compared to the previously published swine RVB G12 strains, this report of RVB in Russian swine increases our epidemiological knowledge on the global prevalence and genetic diversity of RVB.</jats:p>",1
Antibiotics in Feed Induce Prophages in Swine Fecal Microbiomes,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Antibiotics are a cost-effective tool for improving feed efficiency and preventing disease in agricultural animals, but the full scope of their collateral effects is not understood. Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; therefore, one collateral effect could be prophage induction in the gut microbiome at large. Here we used metagenomics to evaluate the effect of two antibiotics in feed (carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and penicillin]) on swine intestinal phage metagenomes (viromes). We also monitored the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population shifts in both the phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes, such as multidrug resistance efflux pumps, were identified in the viromes, but in-feed antibiotics caused no significant changes in their abundance. The abundance of phage integrase-encoding genes was significantly increased in the viromes of medicated swine over that in the viromes of nonmedicated swine, demonstrating the induction of prophages with antibiotic treatment. Phage-bacterium population dynamics were also examined. We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of

            bacteria (prey) when
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            phages (predators) were abundant, supporting the “kill-the-winner” ecological model of population dynamics in the swine fecal microbiome. The data show that gut ecosystem dynamics are influenced by phages and that prophage induction is a collateral effect of in-feed antibiotics.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            This study advances our knowledge of the collateral effects of in-feed antibiotics at a time in which the widespread use of “growth-promoting” antibiotics in agriculture is under scrutiny. Using comparative metagenomics, we show that prophages are induced by in-feed antibiotics in swine fecal microbiomes and that antibiotic resistance genes were detected in most viromes. This suggests that in-feed antibiotics are contributing to phage-mediated gene transfer, potentially of antibiotic resistance genes, in the swine gut. Additionally, the so-called “kill-the-winner” model of phage-bacterium population dynamics has been shown in aquatic ecosystems but met with conflicting evidence in gut ecosystems. The data support the idea that swine fecal
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            bacteria and their phages follow the kill-the-winner model. Understanding the role of phages in gut microbial ecology is an essential component of the antibiotic resistance problem and of developing potential mitigation strategies.

Identification of a Novel Hepacivirus in Domestic Cattle from Germany,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to represent one of the most significant threats to human health. In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses, and dogs, indicating a widespread distribution of hepaciviruses among animals. By applying unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a novel virus of the genus
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepacivirus</jats:named-content>
            was discovered in a bovine serum sample.
            <jats:italic>De novo</jats:italic>

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepacivirus</jats:named-content>
            . Viral RNA screening determined that 1.6% (

            <jats:italic>n =</jats:italic>
            5) of 158 investigated cattle herds in Germany were positive for bovine hepacivirus. Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of animals from one dairy herd proved that a substantial percentage of cows were infected, with some of them being viremic for over 6 months. Clinical and postmortem examination revealed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from different organs and tissues, together with the presence of an miR-122 binding site in the viral genome, strongly suggests a liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for HCV infections in humans.

          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Livestock animals act as important sources for emerging pathogens. In particular, their large herd size and the existence of multiple ways of direct and food-borne infection routes emphasize their role as virus reservoirs. Apart from the search for novel viruses, detailed characterization of these pathogens is indispensable in the context of risk analysis. Here, we describe the identification of a novel HCV-like virus in cattle. In addition, determination of the prevalence and of the course of infection in cattle herds provides valuable insights into the biology of this novel virus. The results presented here form a basis for future studies targeting viral pathogenesis of bovine hepaciviruses and their potential to establish zoonotic infections.

Phage–bacteria relationships and CRISPR elements revealed by a metagenomic survey of the rumen microbiome,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play an important role in balancing microbes within an ecosystem and facilitating horizontal gene transfer. Although bacteriophages are abundant in rumen environments, little is known about the types of viruses present or their interaction with the rumen microbiome. We undertook random pyrosequencing of virus‐enriched metagenomes (viromes) isolated from bovine rumen fluid and analysed the resulting data using comparative metagenomics. A high level of diversity was observed with up to 28 000 different viral genotypes obtained from each environment. The majority (∼78%) of sequences did not match any previously described virus. Prophages outnumbered lytic phages approximately 2:1 with the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types being associated with members of the dominant rumen phyla (<jats:italic>Firmicutes</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Proteobacteria</jats:italic>). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed an enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. We expanded our analysis to include previously described metagenomic data and 14 reference genomes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were detected in most of the microbial genomes, suggesting previous interactions between viral and microbial communities.</jats:p>",1

Characterisation of the Virome of Tonsils from Conventional Pigs and from Specific Pathogen-Free Pigs,"<jats:p>Porcine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by a number of different microorganisms, as well as by non-infectious factors such as the management and environment of the animals. It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development.</jats:p>",1
Identification and complete genome characterization of a novel picornavirus in turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),"<jats:p>Members of the family <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic> are important pathogens of humans and animals, although compared with the thousands of known bird species (&gt;10 000), only a few (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 11) picornaviruses have been identified from avian sources. This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples collected from eight turkey farms in Hungary. Using RT-PCR, both healthy (two of three) and affected (seven of eight) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome were shown to be shedding viruses in seven (88 %) of the eight farms. The viral genome sequence (turkey/M176/2011/HUN; GenBank accession no. JQ691613) shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (96 %) to the partial P3 genome region of a picornavirus reported recently in turkey and chickens from the USA and probably belongs to the same species. In the P1 and P2 regions, turkey/M176/2011/HUN is related most closely to, but distinct from, the kobuviruses and turdivirus 1. Complete genome analysis revealed the presence of characteristic picornaviral amino acid motifs, a potential type II-like 5′ UTR internal ribosome entry site (first identified among avian-origin picornaviruses) and a conserved, 48 nt long ‘barbell-like’ structure found at the 3′ UTR of turkey/M176/2011/HUN and members of the picornavirus genera <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Kobuvirus</jats:italic>. The general presence of turkey picornavirus – a novel picornavirus species – in faecal samples from healthy and affected turkeys in Hungary and in the USA suggests the worldwide occurrence and endemic circulation of this virus in turkey farms. Further studies are needed to investigate the aetiological role and pathogenic potential of this picornavirus in food animals.</jats:p>",1
Genetic characterization of a novel picornavirus in turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) distinct from turkey galliviruses and megriviruses and distantly related to the members of the genus Avihepatovirus,"<jats:p>This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples of healthy (1/3) and affected (6/8) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome in Hungary. The virus was detected at seven of the eight farms examined. The turkey/M176-TuASV/2011/HUN genome (KC465954) was genetically different from the currently known picornaviruses of turkey origin (megriviruses and galliviruses), and showed distant phylogenetic relationship and common genomic features (e.g. uncleaved VP0 and three predicted and unrelated 2A polypeptides) to duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) of the genus <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic>. The complete genome analysis revealed multiple distinct genome features like the presence of two in-tandem aphthovirus 2A-like sequence repeats with DxExNPG/P ‘ribosome-skipping’ sites (76 %, 23/30 amino acids identical), with the first aphthovirus 2A-like sequence being located at the end of the VP1 capsid protein (VP1/2A1 ‘ribosome-skipping’ site). The phylogenetic analyses, low sequence identity (33, 32 and 36 % amino acid identity in P1, P2 and P3 regions) to DHAV, and the type II-like internal ribosome entry site suggests that this turkey picornavirus is related to, but distinct from the genus <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> and it could be the founding member of a novel <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> sister-clade genus.

These findings support the notion that BoAstV infection is a common cause of encephalitis in cattle. Phylogenetically, BoAstV-CH13 was closely related to rare astrovirus isolates from encephalitis cases in animals and a human patient. Future research needs to be directed toward the pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiology, and potential cross-species transmission of these neurotropic astroviruses.

Diarrhoea is a common disease in yaks, resulting in major economic losses. To investigate the diversity of viral species, we reported the metagenomics-derived virome in a pooled faecal sample of 20 diarrhoeic yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhoeic samples, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, were influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared with healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrhoeal samples, indicating a correlation with the clinical symptoms of diarrhoea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a near-full genome was obtained from a diarrhoeic sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4–66.2 % similarity with other related bovine AstVs from faeces. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome demonstrated that the yak AstV fell within the bovine AstVs cluster, but was located in a unique lineage, suggesting a novel AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had closer similarity and genetically relationship with deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than that of the bovine AstVs.

Novel Parvoviruses from Wild and Domestic Animals in Brazil Provide New Insights into Parvovirus Distribution and Diversity,"<jats:p>Parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) are small, single-stranded DNA viruses. Many parvoviral pathogens of medical, veterinary and ecological importance have been identified. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate the diversity of parvoviruses infecting wild and domestic animals in Brazil. We identified 21 parvovirus sequences (including twelve nearly complete genomes and nine partial genomes) in samples derived from rodents, bats, opossums, birds and cattle in Pernambuco, São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul states. These sequences were investigated using phylogenetic and distance-based approaches and were thereby classified into eight parvovirus species (six of which have not been described previously), representing six distinct genera in the subfamily Parvovirinae. Our findings extend the known biogeographic range of previously characterized parvovirus species and the known host range of three parvovirus genera (Dependovirus, Aveparvovirus and Tetraparvovirus). Moreover, our investigation provides a window into the ecological dynamics of parvovirus infections in vertebrates, revealing that many parvovirus genera contain well-defined sub-lineages that circulate widely throughout the world within particular taxonomic groups of hosts.</jats:p>",1

Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea in Europe: In-Detail Analyses of Disease Dynamics and Molecular Epidemiology,"<jats:p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease of swine caused by the eponymous virus (PEDV) which belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae virus family. Following the disastrous outbreaks in Asia and the United States, PEDV has been detected also in Europe. In order to better understand the overall situation, the molecular epidemiology, and factors that might influence the most variable disease impact; 40 samples from swine feces were collected from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries and sequenced by shot-gun next-generation sequencing. A total of 38 new PEDV complete coding sequences were generated. When compared on a global scale, all investigated sequences from Central and South-Eastern Europe formed a rather homogeneous PEDV S INDEL cluster, suggesting a recent re-introduction. However, in-detail analyses revealed two new clusters and putative ancestor strains. Based on the available background data, correlations between clusters and location, farm type or clinical presentation could not be established. Additionally, the impact of secondary infections was explored using the metagenomic data sets. While several coinfections were observed, no correlation was found with disease courses. However, in addition to the PEDV genomes, ten complete viral coding sequences from nine different data sets were reconstructed each representing new virus strains. In detail, three pasivirus A strains, two astroviruses, a porcine sapelovirus, a kobuvirus, a porcine torovirus, a posavirus, and an enterobacteria phage were almost fully sequenced.</jats:p>",1

A porcine enterovirus G associated with enteric disease contains a novel papain-like cysteine protease,"<jats:p>Identification of unknown pathogens in pigs displaying enteric illness is difficult due to the large diversity of bacterial and viral species found within faecal samples. Current methods often require bacterial or viral isolation, or testing only a limited number of known species using quantitative PCR analysis. Herein, faeces from two 25-day-old piglets with diarrhoea from Texas, USA, were analysed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing to rapidly identify possible pathogens. Our analysis included a bioinformatics pipeline of rapid short-read classification and <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> genome assembly which resulted in the identification of a porcine enterovirus G (EV-G), a complete genome with substantial nucleotide differences (&gt;30 %) among current sequences, and a novel non-structural protein similar in sequence to the <jats:italic>Torovirus</jats:italic> papain-like cysteine protease (PL<jats:sup>pro</jats:sup>).

Diversity of viruses detected by deep sequencing in pigs from a common background,"<jats:p> Although advances in nucleic acid sequencing have enabled the discovery of many infectious agents, challenges remain for scientists and veterinary diagnosticians trying to design animal studies with a minimum of variables and to interpret laboratory results. To evaluate pyrosequencing technology as a potential screening method to estimate the virome in pigs, fecal samples were collected from 4 pigs out of a group of 175 that had been raised together since birth. A number of viruses were detected, demonstrating the application of this technology to determine the background “noise” in the pigs. However, pyrosequencing also demonstrated the diversity of viruses within a group of animals and how that can confound experimental design and obscure a definitive diagnosis. </jats:p>",1

A Metagenomics and Case-Control Study To Identify Viruses Associated with Bovine Respiratory Disease,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a common health problem for both dairy and beef cattle, resulting in significant economic loses. In order to identify viruses associated with BRD, we used a metagenomics approach to enrich and sequence viral nucleic acids in the nasal swabs of 50 young dairy cattle with symptoms of BRD. Following deep sequencing,
            <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>
            assembly, and translated protein sequence similarity searches, numerous known and previously uncharacterized viruses were identified. Bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine influenza D virus, bovine parvovirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 6, bovine rhinitis A virus, and multiple genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus were identified. The genomes of a previously uncharacterized astrovirus and picobirnaviruses were also partially or fully sequenced. Using real-time PCR, the rates of detection of the eight viruses that generated the most reads were compared for the nasal secretions of 50 animals with BRD versus 50 location-matched healthy control animals. Viruses were detected in 68% of BRD-affected animals versus 16% of healthy control animals. Thirty-eight percent of sick animals versus 8% of controls were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. Significantly associated with BRD were bovine adenovirus 3 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (

            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.006), which were detected either alone or in combination in 62% of animals with BRD. A metagenomics and real-time PCR detection approach in carefully matched cases and controls can provide a rapid means to identify viruses associated with a complex disease, paving the way for further confirmatory tests and ultimately to effective intervention strategies.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Bovine respiratory disease is the most economically important disease affecting the cattle industry, whose complex root causes include environmental, genetics, and infectious factors. Using an unbiased metagenomics approach, we characterized the viruses in respiratory secretions from BRD cases and identified known and previously uncharacterized viruses belonging to seven viral families. Using a case-control format with location-matched animals, we compared the rates of viral detection and identified 3 viruses associated with severe BRD signs. Combining a metagenomics and case-control format can provide candidate pathogens associated with complex infectious diseases and inform further studies aimed at reducing their impact.

A Novel Porcine Circovirus Distantly Related to Known Circoviruses Is Associated with Porcine Dermatitis and Nephropathy Syndrome and Reproductive Failure,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) is clinically manifested by postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), respiratory and enteric disease, reproductive failure, and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an essential component of PCVAD, although an etiologic role in PDNS is not well established. Here, a novel circovirus, designated porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3), was identified in sows that died acutely with PDNS-like clinical signs. The capsid and replicase proteins of PCV3 are only 37% and 55% identical to PCV2 and bat circoviruses, respectively. Aborted fetuses from sows with PDNS contained high levels of PCV3 (7.57 × 10
            <jats:sup>7</jats:sup>
            genome copies/ml), and no other viruses were detected by PCR and metagenomic sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of sow tissue samples identified PCV3 antigen in skin, kidney, lung, and lymph node samples localized in typical PDNS lesions, including necrotizing vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Further study of archived PDNS tissue samples that were negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis identified 45 of 48 that were PCV3 positive by quantitative PCR (qPCR), with 60% of a subset also testing positive for PCV3 by IHC analysis. Analysis by qPCR of 271 porcine respiratory disease diagnostic submission samples identified 34 PCV3-positive cases (12.5%), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of anti-PCV3 capsid antibodies in serum samples found that 46 (55%) of 83 samples tested were positive. These results suggest that PCV3 commonly circulates within U.S. swine and may play an etiologic role in reproductive failure and PDNS. Because of the high economic impact of PCV2, this novel circovirus warrants further studies to elucidate its significance and role in PCVAD.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            While porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) was first identified in sporadic cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in Canada in the early 1990s, an epidemic of severe systemic disease due to PCV2 spread worldwide in the ensuing decade. Despite being effectively controlled by commercial vaccines, PCV2 remains one of the most economically significant viruses of swine. Here, a novel porcine circovirus (PCV3) that is distantly related to known circoviruses was identified in sows with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) and reproductive failure. PCV2, which has previously been associated with these clinical presentations, was not identified. High levels of PCV3 nucleic acid were observed in aborted fetuses by quantitative PCR, and PCV3 antigen was localized in histologic lesions typical of PDNS in sows by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. PCV3 was also identified in archival PDNS diagnostic samples that previously tested negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis. The emergence of PCV3 warrants further investigation.

"Viral communities associated with porcine respiratory disease complex in intensive commercial farms in Sichuan province, China","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), a common piglet disease, causes substantive economic losses in pig farming. To investigate the viral diversity associated with PRDC, the viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 PRDC-affected piglets were investigated using metagenomics. By deep sequencing and <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> assembly, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but most viruses comprised small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque teno sus virus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC. These results illustrate the complexity of viral communities in the PRDC-affected piglets and highlight the candidate viruses associated with it.</jats:p>",1

The Fecal Virome of Pigs on a High-Density Farm,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Swine are an important source of proteins worldwide but are subject to frequent viral outbreaks and numerous infections capable of infecting humans. Modern farming conditions may also increase viral transmission and potential zoonotic spread. We describe here the metagenomics-derived virome in the feces of 24 healthy and 12 diarrheic piglets on a high-density farm. An average of 4.2 different mammalian viruses were shed by healthy piglets, reflecting a high level of asymptomatic infections. Diarrheic pigs shed an average of 5.4 different mammalian viruses. Ninety-nine percent of the viral sequences were related to the RNA virus families<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Picornaviridae</jats:named-content>,<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Astroviridae</jats:named-content>,<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Coronaviridae</jats:named-content>, and<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Caliciviridae</jats:named-content>, while 1% were related to the small DNA virus families<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Circoviridae</jats:named-content>,<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">and Parvoviridae.</jats:named-content>Porcine RNA viruses identified, in order of decreasing number of sequence reads, consisted of kobuviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and teschoviruses. The near-full genomes of multiple novel species of porcine astroviruses and bocaviruses were generated and phylogenetically analyzed. Multiple small circular DNA genomes encoding replicase proteins plus two highly divergent members of the<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Picornavirales</jats:named-content>order were also characterized. The possible origin of these viral genomes from pig-infecting protozoans and nematodes, based on closest sequence similarities, is discussed. In summary, an unbiased survey of viruses in the feces of intensely farmed animals revealed frequent coinfections with a highly diverse set of viruses providing favorable conditions for viral recombination. Viral surveys of animals can readily document the circulation of known and new viruses, facilitating the detection of emerging viruses and prospective evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials.</jats:p>",1

Nanopore sequencing as a revolutionary diagnostic tool for porcine viral enteric disease complexes identifies porcine kobuvirus as an important enteric virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Enteric diseases in swine are often caused by different pathogens and thus metagenomics are a useful tool for diagnostics. The capacities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics were investigated here. First, cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were already detected at 7 seconds after start of sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3 h. Next, diarrheic feces of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed. Almost all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages, which may have reshaped the piglet’s microbiome. Contigs matched <jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Escherichia</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Enterococcus</jats:italic> phages. Moreover, porcine kobuvirus was discovered in the feces for the first time in Belgium. Suckling piglets shed kobuvirus from one week of age, but an association between peak of viral shedding (10<jats:sup>6.42</jats:sup>–10<jats:sup>7.01</jats:sup> copies/swab) and diarrheic signs was not observed during a follow-up study. Retrospective analysis showed the widespread (n = 25, 56.8% positive) of genetically moderately related kobuviruses among Belgian diarrheic piglets. MinION enables rapid detection of enteric viruses. Such new methodologies will change diagnostics, but more extensive validations should be conducted. The true enteric pathogenicity of porcine kobuvirus should be questioned, while its subclinical importance cannot be excluded.</jats:p>",1

Influenza H7N9 and H9N2 Viruses: Coexistence in Poultry Linked to Human H7N9 Infection and Genome Characteristics,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Avian influenza virus A of the novel H7N9 reassortant subtype was recently found to cause severe human respiratory infections in China. Live poultry markets were suspected locations of the human H7N9 infection sources, based on the cases' exposure histories and sequence similarities between viral isolates. To explore the role of live poultry markets in the origin of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental specimens from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as well as high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified specimens positive for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all of the 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks, and environmental specimens from the markets contained heavily mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2 and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea of the coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, human H7N9 infection cases (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 31) were all negative for H9N2 virus according to real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2, and internal-segment sequences were very close to the sequence of the H9N2 virus circulating in chickens in China recently. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains coexisted with the novel human-pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically linked live poultry markets. Avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus and continues to do so.

            Our results suggest that avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus, a novel reassortant avian influenza virus A subtype, and continues to do so. The finding helps shed light on how the H7N9 virus emerged, spread, and transmitted to humans. It is of considerable interest for assessing the risk of the possible emergence of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced transmissibility to humans.

Viral metagenomics analysis demonstrates the diversity of viral flora in piglet diarrhoeic faeces in China,"<jats:p>To investigate the diversity of viral flora, we used metagenomics to study the viral communities in a pooled faecal sample of 27 diarrhoeic piglets from intensive commercial farms in China. The 15 distinct mammalian viruses identified in the pooled diarrhoeic sample were, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, <jats:italic>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</jats:italic> (PEDV), sapovirus, porcine bocavirus-4 (PBoV-4), sapelovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, PBoV-2, stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus (poSCV), astrovirus (AstV), kobuvirus, posavirus-1, porcine enterovirus-9 (PEV-9), porcine circovirus-like (po-circo-like) virus, picobirnavirus (PBV) and <jats:italic>Torque teno sus virus 2</jats:italic> (TTSuV-2). The prevalence rate of each virus was verified from diarrhoeic and healthy piglets by PCR assay. A mean of 5.5 different viruses were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact co-infected with 11 different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets. Furthermore, we report here for the first time the presence of several recently described viruses in China, and the identification of novel genotypes. Therefore, our investigation results provide an unbiased survey of viral communities and prevalence in faecal samples of piglets.</jats:p>",1
High-throughput whole genome sequencing of <i>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus</i> from cell culture materials and clinical specimens using next-generation sequencing technology,"<jats:p> Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have increasingly played crucial roles in biological and medical research, but are not yet in routine use in veterinary diagnostic laboratories. We developed and applied a procedure for high-throughput RNA sequencing of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from cell culture–derived isolates and clinical specimens. Ten PRRSV isolates with known sequence information, 2 mixtures each with 2 different PRRSV isolates, and 51 clinical specimens (19 sera, 16 lungs, and 16 oral fluids) with various PCR threshold cycle (Ct) values were subjected to nucleic acid extraction, cDNA library preparation (24-plexed), and sequencing. Whole genome sequences were obtained from 10 reference isolates with expected sequences and from sera with a PRRSV real-time reverse transcription PCR Ct ≤ 23.6, lung tissues with Ct ≤ 21, and oral fluids with Ct ≤ 20.6. For mixtures with PRRSV-1 and -2 isolates (57.8% nucleotide identity), NGS was able to distinguish them as well as obtain their respective genome sequences. For mixtures with 2 PRRSV-2 isolates (92.4% nucleotide identity), sequence reads with nucleotide ambiguity at numerous sites were observed, indicating mixed infection; however, individual virus sequences could only be separated when 1 isolate identity and sequence in the mixture is known. The NGS approach described herein offers the prospect of high-throughput sequencing and could be adapted to routine workflows in veterinary diagnostic laboratories, although further improvement of sequencing outcomes from clinical specimens with higher Ct values remains to be investigated. </jats:p>",1

Phylogenetic evidence indicates that pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 viruses were introduced in to South Africa on multiple occasions, based on the presence of two separate lineages, 4bi and 4bii, that have been circulating in Europe and the Far East since the early 1990s. During 2006, a PPMV-1 virus was isolated from an African ground hornbil(l Bucorvus leadbeateri) which becamea cutely infected with PPMV-1 and died, probably after scavenging off infected dove carcasses in the region, since a closely-related PPMV-1 strain was also isolated from doves collected nearby. The hornbill isolate had lCPl and MDT values characteristic of PPMV-1s trains. The threat of PPMV-1 to poultry production and biodiversity in southern Africa highlights the importance of monitoring the spread of this strain.</jats:p>",0

Biological Characterization and Next-Generation Genome Sequencing of the Unclassified Cotia Virus SPAn232 (Poxviridae),"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Cotia virus (COTV) SPAn232 was isolated in 1961 from sentinel mice at Cotia field station, São Paulo, Brazil. Attempts to classify COTV within a recognized genus of the
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Poxviridae</jats:named-content>
            have generated contradictory findings. Studies by different researchers suggested some similarity to myxoma virus and swinepox virus, whereas another investigation characterized COTV SPAn232 as a vaccinia virus strain. Because of the lack of consensus, we have conducted an independent biological and molecular characterization of COTV. Virus growth curves reached maximum yields at approximately 24 to 48 h and were accompanied by virus DNA replication and a characteristic early/late pattern of viral protein synthesis. Interestingly, COTV did not induce detectable cytopathic effects in BSC-40 cells until 4 days postinfection and generated viral plaques only after 8 days. We determined the complete genomic sequence of COTV by using a combination of the next-generation DNA sequencing technologies 454 and Illumina. A unique contiguous sequence of 185,139 bp containing 185 genes, including the 90 genes conserved in all chordopoxviruses, was obtained. COTV has an interesting panel of open reading frames (ORFs) related to the evasion of host defense, including two novel genes encoding C-C chemokine-like proteins, each present in duplicate copies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the highest amino acid identity scores with

"Host–parasite relations of bacteria and phages can be unveiled by <i>Oligostickiness</i>, a measure of relaxed sequence similarity","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Motivation: The recent metagenome analysis has been producing a large number of host-unassigned viruses. Although assigning viruses to their hosts is basically important not only for virology but also for prevention of epidemic, it has been a laborious and difficult task to date. The only effective method for this purpose has been to find them in a same microscopic view. Now, we tried a computational approach based on genome sequences of bacteria and phages, introducing a physicochemical parameter, SOSS (set of oligostickiness similarity score) derived from oligostickiness, a measure of binding affinity of oligonucleotides to template DNA.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Results: We could confirm host–parasite relationships of bacteria and their phages by SOSS analysis: all phages tested (25 species) had a remarkably higher SOSS value with its host than with unrelated bacteria. Interestingly, according to SOSS values, lysogenic phages such as lambda phage (host: Escherichia coli) or SPP1 (host: Bacillus subtilis) have distinctively higher similarity with its host than its non-lysogenic (excretive or virulent) ones such as fd and T4 (host: E.coli) or phages gamma and PZA (host: B.subtilis). This finding is very promising for assigning host-unknown viruses to its host. We also investigated the relationship in codon usage frequency or G+C content of genomes to interpret the phenomenon revealed by SOSS analysis, obtaining evidences which support the hypothesis that higher SOSS values resulted from the cohabitation in the same environment which may cause the common biased mutation. Thus, lysogenic phages which stay inside longer resemble the host.</jats:p>

Etiology and pathology of epidemic outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 infection in Egyptian chicken farms,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Epidemic outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) virus H5N1 have been frequently reported in Egypt during the last nine years. Here we investigate the involvement of AI H5N1 in outbreaks of acute respiratory disease that occurred in several commercial chicken farms in Egypt in 2011, and we describe to the pathology caused by the virus in the course of the outbreak.</jats:p><jats:p>Twenty-one chicken farms with history of acute respiratory symptoms and high mortalities were screened for AI H5N1. Virus identification was based on hemagglutination inhibition test, and PCR detection and sequencing of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. Virus distribution was determined by immunohistochemical staining of AI antigens in organs of infected birds. Standard H&amp;E staining was performed for histological examination of affected organs.</jats:p><jats:p>Eighty-one % of the examined birds, representing 100% of the screened farms, were positive for AI H5N1 virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the isolated virus reveals its affiliation to clade 2.2.1. Viral antigens were localized in the endothelial cells of the heart, liver, lungs and skin, where pathological lesions including congestion, hemorrhages, multifocal inflammation and necrosis were concurrently observed. According to the pattern of the viral antigen and lesion distribution in the visceral organs, we suggest cardiovascular and circulatory failures as the probable cause of death during these outbreaks. In conclusion, the present study further confirms the epidemic status of AI H5N1 virus in Egypt and reveals the highly pathogenic nature of the local isolates.</jats:p>",0

A virus discovery method incorporating DNase treatment and its application to the identification of two bovine parvovirus species,"<jats:p>
            Identification of previously unrecognized viral agents in serum or
 plasma samples is of great medical interest but remains a major
 challenge, primarily because of abundant host DNA. The current methods,
 library screening or representational difference analysis (RDA), are
 very laborious and require selected sample sets. We have developed a
 simple and reproducible method for discovering viruses in single serum
 samples that is based on DNase treatment of the serum followed by
 restriction enzyme digestion and sequence-independent single primer
 amplification (SISPA) of the fragments, and have evaluated its
 performance on known viruses. Both DNA viruses and RNA viruses at a
 concentration of ≈10
            <jats:sup>6</jats:sup>
            genome equivalents per ml were
 reproducibly identified in 50 μl of serum. While evaluating the
 method, two previously unknown parvoviruses were discovered in the
 bovine sera used as diluent. The near complete genome sequence of each
 virus was determined; their classification as two species
 (provisionally named bovine parvoviruses 2 and 3) was confirmed by
 phylogenetic analysis. Both viruses were found to be frequent
 contaminants of commercial bovine serum. DNase treatment of serum
 samples may prove to be a very useful tool for virus discovery. The
 DNase-SISPA method is suitable for screening of a large number of
 samples and also enables rapid sequence determination of high-titer
 viruses.

Antibiotics in Feed Induce Prophages in Swine Fecal Microbiomes,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Antibiotics are a cost-effective tool for improving feed efficiency and preventing disease in agricultural animals, but the full scope of their collateral effects is not understood. Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; therefore, one collateral effect could be prophage induction in the gut microbiome at large. Here we used metagenomics to evaluate the effect of two antibiotics in feed (carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and penicillin]) on swine intestinal phage metagenomes (viromes). We also monitored the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population shifts in both the phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes, such as multidrug resistance efflux pumps, were identified in the viromes, but in-feed antibiotics caused no significant changes in their abundance. The abundance of phage integrase-encoding genes was significantly increased in the viromes of medicated swine over that in the viromes of nonmedicated swine, demonstrating the induction of prophages with antibiotic treatment. Phage-bacterium population dynamics were also examined. We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            bacteria (prey) when
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            phages (predators) were abundant, supporting the “kill-the-winner” ecological model of population dynamics in the swine fecal microbiome. The data show that gut ecosystem dynamics are influenced by phages and that prophage induction is a collateral effect of in-feed antibiotics.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            This study advances our knowledge of the collateral effects of in-feed antibiotics at a time in which the widespread use of “growth-promoting” antibiotics in agriculture is under scrutiny. Using comparative metagenomics, we show that prophages are induced by in-feed antibiotics in swine fecal microbiomes and that antibiotic resistance genes were detected in most viromes. This suggests that in-feed antibiotics are contributing to phage-mediated gene transfer, potentially of antibiotic resistance genes, in the swine gut. Additionally, the so-called “kill-the-winner” model of phage-bacterium population dynamics has been shown in aquatic ecosystems but met with conflicting evidence in gut ecosystems. The data support the idea that swine fecal
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            bacteria and their phages follow the kill-the-winner model. Understanding the role of phages in gut microbial ecology is an essential component of the antibiotic resistance problem and of developing potential mitigation strategies.

Characterization of H5N1 influenza A virus that caused the first highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in Saudi Arabia,"<jats:p>Introduction: Saudi Arabia (SA) experienced a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak in domesticated birds in 2007. Methodology: Forty-three hemagglutinin (HA) and 41 neuraminidase (NA) genes of HPAI H5N1 viruses were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses of completely sequenced genes were performed to compare with other viral HA and NA gene sequences available in the public databases. Results: Molecular characterization of the H5N1 viruses revealed two genetically distinct clades, 2.2.2 and 2.3.1, of H5N1 viruses circulating in the area. Amino acid sequence analysis of the HA gene indicated that the virus from 2.2.2 contained the sequence SPQGERRRK-R/G at the cleavage site, while the virus from 2.3.1 contained the sequence SPQRERRRK-R/G. Additionally, a few mutations with amino acid substitutions such as M226I at N-link glycosylation site were identified in two of these isolates. Amino acid sequence of the NA gene showed a 20-amino-acid deletion in the NA stalk region, required for enhanced virulence of influenza viruses and its adaptation from wild birds to domestic chickens. As close contact between humans and birds is unavoidable, there is a need for a thorough understanding of the virus epidemiology, factors affecting the spread of the virus, and molecular characterization such as phylogeny and substitution rates of H5N1 viruses circulating in the region. Conclusion: Two genetically distinct clades were found to be circulating in the country, which could likely result in recombination and emergence of more virulent viral strains. These findings could be helpful for the authorities devising control measures against these viruses.</jats:p>",0

Double-Stranded RNA High-Throughput Sequencing Reveals a New Cytorhabdovirus in a Bean Golden Mosaic Virus-Resistant Common Bean Transgenic Line,"<jats:p>Using double-strand RNA (dsRNA) high-throughput sequencing, we identified five RNA viruses in a bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV)-resistant common bean transgenic line with symptoms of viral infection. Four of the identified viruses had already been described as infecting common bean (cowpea mild mottle virus, bean rugose mosaic virus, Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus 1, and Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus 2) and one is a putative new plant rhabdovirus (genus Cytorhabdovirus), tentatively named bean-associated cytorhabdovirus (BaCV). The BaCV genome presented all five open reading frames (ORFs) found in most rhabdoviruses: nucleoprotein (N) (ORF1) (451 amino acids, aa), phosphoprotein (P) (ORF2) (445 aa), matrix (M) (ORF4) (287 aa), glycoprotein (G) (ORF5) (520 aa), and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) (ORF6) (114 aa), as well as a putative movement protein (P3) (ORF3) (189 aa) and the hypothetical small protein P4. The predicted BaCV proteins were compared to homologous proteins from the closest cytorhabdoviruses, and a low level of sequence identity (15–39%) was observed. The phylogenetic analysis shows that BaCV clustered with yerba mate chlorosis-associated virus (YmCaV) and rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV). Overall, our results provide strong evidence that BaCV is indeed a new virus species in the genus Cytorhabdovirus (family Rhabdoviridae), the first rhabdovirus to be identified infecting common bean.</jats:p>",0

Bovine-like coronaviruses in domestic and wild ruminants,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) produce a wide spectrum of disease syndromes in different mammalian and avian host species. These viruses are well-recognized for their ability to change tissue tropism, to hurdle the interspecies barriers and to adapt ecological variations. It is predicted that the inherent genetic diversity of CoVs caused by accumulation of point mutations and high frequency of homologous recombination is the principal determinant of these competences. Several CoVs (e.g. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) have been recorded to cross the interspecies barrier, inducing different disease conditions in variable animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is a primary cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in cattle calves, winter dysentery in lactating cows and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Although it has long been known as a restrictive cattle pathogen, CoVs that are closely related to BCoV have been recognized in dogs, humans and in other ruminant species. Biologic, antigenic and genetic analyses of the so-called ‘bovine-like CoVs’ proposed classification of these viruses as host-range variants rather than distinct virus species. In this review, the different bovine-like CoVs that have been identified in domesticated ruminants (water buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary camel, llama and alpaca) and wild ruminants (deer, wild cattle, antelopes, giraffes and wild goats) are discussed in terms of epidemiology, transmission and virus characteristics. The presented data denote the importance of these viruses in the persistence of BCoV in nature, spread to new geographical zones, and continuous emergence of disease epidemics in cattle farms.</jats:p>",0

            West Nile virus has evolved in concert with its expansion across North America, but little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of the virus on local scales. We analysed viral nucleotide sequences from mosquitoes collected in 2005, 2006, and 2007 from a known transmission ‘hot spot’ in suburban Chicago, USA. Within this approximately 11 × 14 km area, the viral envelope gene has increased approximately 0.1% yr
            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>
            in nucleotide-level genetic diversity. In each year, viral diversity was higher in ‘residential’ sites characterized by dense housing than in more open ‘urban green space’ sites such as cemeteries and parks. Phylodynamic analyses showed an increase in incidence around 2005, consistent with a higher-than-average peak in mosquito and human infection rates that year. Analyses of times to most recent common ancestor suggest that WNV in 2005 and 2006 may have arisen predominantly from viruses present during 2004 and 2005, respectively, but that WNV in 2007 had an older common ancestor, perhaps indicating a predominantly mixed or exogenous origin. These results show that the population of WNV in suburban Chicago is an admixture of viruses that are both locally derived and introduced from elsewhere, containing evolutionary information aggregated across a breadth of spatial and temporal scales.

Serotype 2 viruses were the dominant serotype all years except 2012 when serotype 6 viruses represented 63 % of the isolates. High genetic similarity (&gt;94 % identity) between serotype 1 and 2 virus VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, NS1, NS2 and NS3 segments prevented identification of reassortment events for these segments. Additionally, there was little genetic diversity (&gt;96 % identity) within serotypes for VP2, VP5 and VP7. Preferential reassortment within the homologous serotype was observed for VP2, VP5 and VP7 segments for type 1 and type 2 viruses. In contrast, type 6 viruses were all reassortants containing VP2 and VP5 derived from an exotic type 6 with the remaining segments most similar to type 2 viruses. These results suggest that reassortment between type 1 and type 2 viruses requires conservation of the VP2, VP5 and VP7 segment constellation while type 6 viruses only require VP2 and VP5 and are restricted to type 2-lineage VP7. As type 6 VP2 and VP5 segments were exclusively identified in viruses with type 2-derived VP7, these results suggest functional complementation between type 2 and type 6 VP7 proteins.</jats:p>",0

A Phylogeny-Based Global Nomenclature System and Automated Annotation Tool for H1 Hemagglutinin Genes from Swine Influenza A Viruses,"<jats:p>A fundamental goal in the biological sciences is the definition of groups of organisms based on evolutionary history and the naming of those groups. For influenza A viruses (IAVs) in swine, understanding the hemagglutinin (HA) genetic lineage of a circulating strain aids in vaccine antigen selection and allows for inferences about vaccine efficacy. Previous reporting of H1 virus HA in swine relied on colloquial names, frequently with incriminating and stigmatizing geographic toponyms, making comparisons between studies challenging. To overcome this, we developed an adaptable nomenclature using measurable criteria for historical and contemporary evolutionary patterns of H1 global swine IAVs. We also developed a web-accessible tool that classifies viruses according to this nomenclature. This classification system will aid agricultural production and pandemic preparedness through the identification of important changes in swine IAVs and provides terminology enabling discussion of swine IAVs in a common context among animal and human health initiatives.</jats:p>",0

We found that the<jats:italic>PB1</jats:italic>gene of the 1918 pandemic virus had ENC values similar to the H1N1 classical swine and human viruses, but different ENC values from avian as well as H2N2 and H3N2 human viruses. Also, according to the RSCU of the<jats:italic>PB1</jats:italic>gene, the 1918 virus grouped with all human isolates and “classical” swine H1N1 viruses. The phylogenetic studies of all eight RNA gene segments of influenza A viruses may indicate that the 1918 pandemic strain originated from a H1N1 swine virus, which itself might be derived from a H1N1 avian precursor, which was separated from the bulk of other avian viruses in toto a long time ago. The high stability of the RSCU pattern of the<jats:italic>PB1</jats:italic>gene indicated that the integrity of RNA structure is more important for influenza virus evolution than previously thought.</jats:p>",0

Wild-Type Gross Leukemia Virus: Classification of Soluble Antigens (GSA),"<jats:p>
            By inhibiting techniques using indirect immunofluorescence tests and indirect immunoelectron microscopy, the G(Gross) soluble antigens (GSA) in the body fluids of AKR and C58 mice, which have a high incidence of spontaneous leukemia, were classified according to the known specificity of G antigens in the murine Gross leukemia system. GSA existing in the plasma of nonleukemic and leukemic AKR mice and in the ascitic fluid of transplanted AKR spontaneous leukemia K36 showed the several specificities corresponding to G cell surface antigens, GCSAa, b, and c, and type-specific and group-specific viral envelope antigens, tsVEA and gsVEA, respectively. However, the plasma of nonleukemic C58 mice lacks GSAc, which can be recognized by the G-typing mouse serum. GSA corresponding to G

Metagenomic Virome Analysis of Culex Mosquitoes from Kenya and China,"<jats:p>Many blood-feeding arthropods are known vectors of viruses that are a source of unprecedented global health concern. Mosquitoes are an integral part of these arthropod vectors. Advancements in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics has expanded our knowledge on the richness of viruses harbored by arthropods. In the present study, we applied a metagenomic approach to determine the intercontinental virome diversity of Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus in Kwale, Kenya and provinces of Hubei and Yunnan in China. Our results showed that viromes from the three locations were strikingly diverse and comprised 30 virus families specific to vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and protozoa as well as unclassified group of viruses. Though sampled at different times, both Kwale and Hubei mosquito viromes were dominated by vertebrate viruses, in contrast to the Yunnan mosquito virome, which was dominated by insect-specific viruses. However, each virome was unique in terms of virus proportions partly influenced by type of ingested meals (blood, nectar, plant sap, environment substrates). The dominant vertebrate virus family in the Kwale virome was Papillomaviridae (57%) while in Hubei it was Herpesviridae (30%) and the Yunnan virome was dominated by an unclassified viruses group (27%). Given that insect-specific viruses occur naturally in their hosts, they should be the basis for defining the viromes. Hence, the dominant insect-specific viruses in Kwale, Hubei, and Yunnan were Baculoviridae, Nimaviridae and Iflaviridae, respectively. Our study is preliminary but contributes to growing and much needed knowledge, as mosquito viromes could be manipulated to prevent and control pathogenic arboviruses.</jats:p>",0

            Hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to represent one of the most significant threats to human health. In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses, and dogs, indicating a widespread distribution of hepaciviruses among animals. By applying unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a novel virus of the genus

            . Viral RNA screening determined that 1.6% (

            <jats:italic>n =</jats:italic>
            5) of 158 investigated cattle herds in Germany were positive for bovine hepacivirus. Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of animals from one dairy herd proved that a substantial percentage of cows were infected, with some of them being viremic for over 6 months. Clinical and postmortem examination revealed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from different organs and tissues, together with the presence of an miR-122 binding site in the viral genome, strongly suggests a liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for HCV infections in humans.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Livestock animals act as important sources for emerging pathogens. In particular, their large herd size and the existence of multiple ways of direct and food-borne infection routes emphasize their role as virus reservoirs. Apart from the search for novel viruses, detailed characterization of these pathogens is indispensable in the context of risk analysis. Here, we describe the identification of a novel HCV-like virus in cattle. In addition, determination of the prevalence and of the course of infection in cattle herds provides valuable insights into the biology of this novel virus. The results presented here form a basis for future studies targeting viral pathogenesis of bovine hepaciviruses and their potential to establish zoonotic infections.

Poxviruses in Bats … so What?,"<jats:p>Poxviruses are important pathogens of man and numerous domestic and wild animal species. Cross species (including zoonotic) poxvirus infections can have drastic consequences for the recipient host. Bats are a diverse order of mammals known to carry lethal viral zoonoses such as Rabies, Hendra, Nipah, and SARS. Consequent targeted  research is revealing bats to be infected with a rich diversity of novel viruses. Poxviruses were recently identified in bats and the settings in which they were found were  dramatically different. Here, we review the natural history of poxviruses in bats and  highlight the relationship of the viruses to each other and their context in the Poxviridae family. In addition to considering the zoonotic potential of these viruses, we reflect on the broader implications of these findings. Specifically, the potential to explore and exploit this newfound relationship to study coevolution and cross species transmission together with fundamental aspects of poxvirus host tropism as well as bat virology and immunology.</jats:p>",0
"Novel, Potentially Zoonotic Paramyxoviruses from the African Straw-Colored Fruit Bat Eidolon helvum","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bats carry a variety of paramyxoviruses that impact human and domestic animal health when spillover occurs. Recent studies have shown a great diversity of paramyxoviruses in an urban-roosting population of straw-colored fruit bats in Ghana. Here, we investigate this further through virus isolation and describe two novel rubulaviruses: Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2). The viruses form a phylogenetic cluster with each other and other bat-derived rubulaviruses, such as Tuhoko viruses, Menangle virus, and Tioman virus. We developed AchPV1- and AchPV2-specific serological assays and found evidence of infection with both viruses in
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Eidolon helvum</jats:named-content>

            indicates virus persistence within fruit bat populations and suggests spread of AchPVs via horizontal transmission. We also detected possible serological evidence of human infection with AchPV2 in Ghana and Tanzania. It is likely that clinically significant zoonotic spillover of chiropteran paramyxoviruses could be missed throughout much of Africa where health surveillance and diagnostics are poor and comorbidities, such as infection with HIV or

Investigation of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in the Mbala and Kazungula districts of Zambia,"<jats:p>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, highly contagious viral infection of domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals. It is known to be endemic in Zambia, with periodic outbreaks occurring in different geographical areas of the country. This study was conducted to investigate the presence of FMD virus (FMDV) in reported FMD-suspected cases in cattle from the Kazungula and Mbala districts of Zambia. Sixty epithelial tissues or oesophageal-pharyngeal (OP) scrapings (probang samples) were collected from Mbala (n = 51) and Kazungula (n = 9) and examined for FMDV. The FMDV viral RNA and serotypes were examined by realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and antigen Enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Twenty-two samples (36.7%) were positive for the FMDV genome by qRT-PCR with Cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 13 to 31. The FMDV-positive samples from epithelial tissues showed relatively higher Ct values compared to those obtained from OP scrapings, irrespective of geographical location. Forty percent (40%; n = 4) of epithelial tissues from Mbala were serotyped into SAT 2 serotype by antigen ELISA. Kazungula samples were serotyped into SAT 1. These findings indicated that Mbala and Kazungula districts had FMD outbreaks in 2012 that were ascribed to at least FMDV serotype SAT 2 and SAT 1 field strains. Furthermore, regular interaction between buffalos from the Mosi-o Tunya Park and domestic animals from surrounding areas could contribute to the occurrence of regular FMD outbreaks in Kazungula, whilst the uncontrolled animal movements across borders between Mbala and Nsumbawanga could be responsible for disease outbreaks in Mbala. In-depth molecular biological studies, including sequencing and phylogeny of the viruses, should be conducted to elucidate the complex epidemiology of FMD in Zambia, thereby providing valuable information needed for the rational control strategy of FMD in Zambia and neighbouring countries.</jats:p>",0
Isolation and Metagenomic Identification of Avian Leukosis Virus Associated with Mortality in Broiler Chicken,"<jats:p>Avian leukosis virus (ALV) belongs to the family Retroviridae and causes considerable economic losses to the poultry industry. Following an outbreak associated with high mortality in a broiler flock in northern part of Malaysia, kidney tissues from affected chickens were submitted for virus isolation and identification in chicken embryonated egg and MDCK cells. Evidence of virus growth was indicated by haemorrhage and embryo mortality in egg culture. While viral growth in cell culture was evidenced by the development of cytopathic effects. The isolated virus was purified by sucrose gradient and identified using negative staining transmission electron microscopy. Further confirmation was achieved through next-generation sequencing and nucleotide sequence homology search. Analysis of the viral sequences using the NCBI BLAST tool revealed 99-100% sequence homology with exogenous ALV viral envelope protein. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial envelope sequences showed the Malaysian isolate clustered with Taiwanese and Japanese ALV strains, which were closer to ALV subgroup J, ALV subgroup E, and recombinant A/E isolates. Based on these findings, ALV was concluded to be associated with the present outbreak. It was recommended that further studies should be conducted on the molecular epidemiology and pathogenicity of the identified virus isolate.</jats:p>",0

Infection of macrophages by a lymphotropic herpesvirus: a new tropism for Marek's disease virus,"<jats:p>Marek's disease virus (MDV) is classified as an oncogenic lymphotropic herpesvirus of chickens.

The aims of this study were to identify whether MDV infects macrophages<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>and, if so, whether quantitative differences in macrophage infection are associated with MDV strain virulence. Chickens were infected with either virulent MDV (HPRS-16) or ‘hypervirulent’ MDV (C12/130). Flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies recognizing MDV pp38 antigen and leukocyte antigens was used to identify MDV lytically infected cells. Macrophages from HPRS-16- and C12/130-infected chickens were pp38<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>. It is demonstrated that macrophages are pp38<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>because they are infected and not because they have phagocytosed MDV antigens, as assessed by confocal microscopy using antibodies recognizing MDV antigens of the three herpesvirus kinetic classes: infected cell protein 4 (ICP4, immediate early), pp38 (early) and glycoprotein B (gB, late). Spleen macrophages from MDV-infected chickens were ICP4<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, pp38<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>and gB<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, and ICP4 had nuclear localization denoting infection. Finally, MDV pp38<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>macrophages had high inherent death rates, confirming cytolytic MDV infection, although production of virus particles has not been detected yet. These results have two fundamental implications for understanding MDV pathogenesis: (i) MDV evolved to perturb innate, in addition to acquired, immunity and (ii) macrophages are excellent candidates for transporting MDV to primary lymphoid organs during the earliest stages of pathogenesis.</jats:p>",0

‘Schmallenberg virus’ – a novel orthobunyavirus emerging in Europe,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>In 2011, a novel orthobunyavirus of the Simbu serogroup, the Schmallenberg virus (SBV), was discovered using a metagenomic approach. SBV caused a large epidemic in Europe in ruminants. As with related viruses such as Akabane virus, it appears to be transmitted by biting midges. Transplacental infection often results in the birth of malformed calves, lambs and goat kids. In more than 5000 farms in Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, UK, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Denmark and Switzerland acute infections of adult ruminants or malformed SBV-positive offspring were detected, and high seroprevalences were seen in adult ruminants in the core regions in The Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.

Serological characterization of bovine rotaviruses isolated from dairy and beef herds in Argentina,"<jats:p>Bovine rotaviruses isolated from beef and dairy herds in Argentina were serotyped by the immunoperoxidase focus reduction assay as previously described (G. Gerna, M. Battaglia, G. Milenesi, N. Passarani, E. Percivalle, and E. Cattaneo, Infect. Immun. 43:722-729, 1984). Three strains from beef herds were related to the UK and NCDV bovine rotavirus strains defined as serotype 6 (Y. Hoshino, R. G. Wyatt, H. B. Greenberg, J. Flores, and A. Z. Kapikian, J. Infect. Dis. 149:694-702, 1984). Two other strains from dairy herds were classified as bovine viruses related to the bovine B223 strain reported by Woode and co-workers (G. N. Woode, N. E. Kelso, T. F. Simpson, S. K. Gaul, L. E. Evans, and L. Babiuk, J. Clin. Microbiol. 18:358-364, 1983) in the United States. A serotyping antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunoassay to detect serotype 6 rotavirus using a serotype 6-specific monoclonal antibody was developed and evaluated for strain characterization. Characterization of 72 group A rotavirus-positive fecal samples from beef herds and 43 fecal samples from dairy herds showed a predominance of serotype 6 rotavirus in beef herds but both serotype 6 and non-serotype 6 rotaviruses in dairy herds. Analysis of genomic double-stranded RNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that when outbreaks were caused by one serotype only a single electropherotype was present in all samples.</jats:p>",0
Genotype Diversity of Newcastle Disease Virus in Nigeria: Disease Control Challenges and Future Outlook,"<jats:p>Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most important avian diseases with considerable threat to the productivity of poultry all over the world. The disease is associated with severe respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological lesions in chicken leading to high mortality and several other production related losses. The aetiology of the disease is an avian paramyxovirus type-1 or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), whose isolates are serologically grouped into a single serotype but genetically classified into a total of 19 genotypes, owing to the continuous emergence and evolution of the virus. In Nigeria, molecular characterization of NDV is generally very scanty and majorly focuses on the amplification of the partial F gene for genotype assignment. However, with the introduction of the most objective NDV genotyping criteria which utilize complete fusion protein coding sequences in phylogenetic taxonomy, the enormous genetic diversity of the virus in Nigeria became very conspicuous. In this review, we examine the current ecological distribution of various NDV genotypes in Nigeria based on the available complete fusion protein nucleotide sequences (1662 bp) in the NCBI database. We then discuss the challenges of ND control as a result of the wide genetic distance between the currently circulating NDV isolates and the commonest vaccines used to combat the disease in the country. Finally, we suggest future directions in the war against the economically devastating ND in Nigeria.</jats:p>",0

Molecular characterisation of epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus associated with a Tunisian outbreak among cattle in 2006,"<jats:p>In 2006, epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) outbreaks were recorded in the Maghreb (Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria) among cattle, resulting in severe repercussions on herds (oedema of the head, necrotic lesions of the oral mucosa, hyperthermia of the teats, accompanied by anorexia and respiratory distress) and economic losses. The present study gives new information on the molecular characterisation of the EHD virus (EHDV) that had circulated in Tunisia. Genome segments 2, 3, 6, 7 and 10 of EHDV, corresponding to the VP2, VP3, VP5, VP7 and NS3/NS3A proteins, respectively, were amplified from the blood of one animal by RT-PCR and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence comparisons of these five segments with sequences available in the GenBank demonstrated that an EHDV serotype 6 (EHDV-6) had been present in Tunisia in 2006. The possible origin of this strain is discussed.</jats:p>",0

A cada criterio se le adjudicó un coeficiente entre 0 y 7 de acuerdo con su impacto medido con base en la información científica (suma total de 189). La información sobre los criterios para las nueve enfermedades virales analizadas se recolectó mediante la revisión de 81 fuentes publicadas entre 1977 y 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resultados.&lt;/strong&gt; Las tres enfermedades con mayor puntaje y potencial zoonótico fueron la influenza porcina (133), la hepatitis E (123) y la infección por hantavirus (103), y la mayor puntuación se observó en los criterios de epidemiología y salud pública.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusión.&lt;/strong&gt; Los métodos semicuantitativos de priorización son una fuente de información para la toma de decisiones, pero su utilización es poco frecuente en los países en desarrollo por la falta de datos de vigilancia en salud pública.

Analysis of the Variability in the Non-Coding Regions of Influenza A Viruses,"<jats:p>The genomes of influenza A viruses (IAVs) comprise eight negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments. In addition to the protein-coding region, each segment possesses 5′ and 3′ non-coding regions (NCR) that are important for transcription, replication and packaging. The NCRs contain both conserved and segment-specific sequences, and the impacts of variability in the NCRs are not completely understood. Full NCRs have been determined from some viruses, but a detailed analysis of potential variability in these regions among viruses from different host groups and locations has not been performed. To evaluate the degree of conservation in NCRs among different viruses, we sequenced the NCRs of IAVs isolated from different wild bird host groups (ducks, gulls and seabirds). We then extended our study to include NCRs available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Influenza Virus Database, which allowed us to analyze a wider variety of host species and more HA and NA subtypes. We found that the amount of variability within the NCRs varies among segments, with the greatest variation found in the HA and NA and the least in the M and NS segments. Overall, variability in NCR sequences was correlated with the coding region phylogeny, suggesting vertical coevolution of the (coding sequence) CDS and NCR regions.</jats:p>",0

Phage–bacteria relationships and CRISPR elements revealed by a metagenomic survey of the rumen microbiome,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play an important role in balancing microbes within an ecosystem and facilitating horizontal gene transfer. Although bacteriophages are abundant in rumen environments, little is known about the types of viruses present or their interaction with the rumen microbiome. We undertook random pyrosequencing of virus‐enriched metagenomes (viromes) isolated from bovine rumen fluid and analysed the resulting data using comparative metagenomics. A high level of diversity was observed with up to 28 000 different viral genotypes obtained from each environment. The majority (∼78%) of sequences did not match any previously described virus. Prophages outnumbered lytic phages approximately 2:1 with the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types being associated with members of the dominant rumen phyla (<jats:italic>Firmicutes</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Proteobacteria</jats:italic>). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed an enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. We expanded our analysis to include previously described metagenomic data and 14 reference genomes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were detected in most of the microbial genomes, suggesting previous interactions between viral and microbial communities.</jats:p>",0
Using noninvasive metagenomics to characterize viral communities from wildlife,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Microbial communities play an important role in organismal and ecosystem health. While high‐throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and limited quantities of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (<jats:italic>Desmodus rotundus</jats:italic>), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. Based on finding viral contamination in foetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or another nonbiological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low‐input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments and time.</jats:p>",0
Antigenic and genetic characterization of rabies viruses isolated from domestic and wild animals of Brazil identifies the hoary fox as a rabies reservoir,"<jats:p>Fifty Brazilian rabies viruses, collected from many different animal species and several regions of the country, were characterized by partial sequencing of the central, variable region of the <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> gene, a locus useful for sensitive molecular epidemiological studies. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences, which included comparison with other rabies strains recovered from throughout the Americas, identified three main groups of Brazilian viruses, arbitrarily designated BRL-1 to BRL-3. BRL-1 was found in terrestrial carnivores and clusters with other American strains of the cosmopolitan lineage. BRL-2 comprised two distinct isolates, recovered from two species of non-haematophagous bats, that had evolutionary links to insectivorous-bat-derived strains of North America. BRL-3 consisted of isolates from vampire bats and from livestock species probably infected via contact with vampire bats. The terrestrial group was further subdivided into three subtypes: BRL-1a was associated exclusively with dogs and cats, while BRL-1b and BRL-1c were found exclusively in hoary foxes. These observations strongly support the role of the Brazilian hoary fox as a rabies reservoir. Screening of representative Brazilian rabies viruses against a collection of anti-rabies monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified a small panel of mAbs that could be used to discriminate between all Brazilian subgroups as defined by genetic classification in this study.</jats:p>",0
"Human herpesvirus 7 is a T-lymphotropic virus and is related to, but significantly different from, human herpesvirus 6 and human cytomegalovirus.","<jats:p>An independent strain (JI) of human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) was isolated from a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). No significant association could be established by seroepidemiology between HHV-7 and CFS. HHV-7 is a T-lymphotropic virus, infecting CD4+ and CD8+ primary lymphocytes. HHV-7 can also infect SUP-T1, an immature T-cell line, with variable success. Southern blot analysis with DNA probes scanning 58.8% of the human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) genome and hybridizing to all HHV-6 strains tested so far revealed homology to HHV-7 with only 37.4% of the total probe length. HHV-7 contains the GGGTTA repetitive sequence, as do HHV-6 and Marek's disease chicken herpesvirus. DNA sequencing of a 186-base-pair fragment of HHV-7(JI) revealed an identity with HHV-6 and human cytomegalovirus of 57.5% and 36%, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers derived from this sequence (HV7/HV8, HV10/HV11) amplified HHV-7 DNA only and did not amplify DNA from other human herpesviruses, including 12 different HHV-6 strains. Southern blot analysis with the p43L3 probe containing the 186-base-pair HHV-7 DNA fragment hybridized to HHV-7 DNA only. The molecular divergence between human cytomegalovirus, on the one hand, and HHV-6 and HHV-7, on the other, is greater than between HHV-6 and HHV-7, which, in turn, is greater than the difference between HHV-6 strains. This study supports the classification of HHV-7 as an additional member of the human beta-herpesviruses.</jats:p>",0

Genetic analysis of full-length genomes and subgenomic sequences of TT virus-like mini virus human isolates,"<jats:p>The phylogenetic relationship between the complete genomic sequences of ten Japanese and one French isolate of TT virus-like mini virus (TLMV) was investigated. Analysis of the variability of the nucleotide sequences and the detection of signature patterns for overlapping genes suggested that ORFs 1 and 2 are probably functional. However, this was not the case for a putative third ORF, ORF3. Throughout the viral genome, several nucleotide or amino acid motifs that are conserved in circoviruses such as TT virus (TTV) and chicken anaemia virus were identified. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished three main groups of TLMV and allowed the identification of putative recombination breakpoints in the untranslated region. TLMV genomes were detected by PCR in the plasma of 38/50 French blood donors tested and were also identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, faeces and saliva. A phylogenetic study of 37 TLMV strains originating from France, Japan and Brazil showed that groupings were not related to geographical origin.</jats:p>",0
Polymerase errors accumulating during natural evolution of the glycoprotein gene of vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana serotype isolates,"<jats:p>We report the entire glycoprotein (G) gene nucleotide sequences of 26 vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana serotype (VSV IND) type 1 isolates from North and Central America. These sequences are also compared with partial G gene sequences of VSV IND type 2 (Cocal) and type 3 (Alagoas) viruses and the complete G gene sequences of the more distantly related VSV New Jersey (NJ) and Chandipura viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the G gene sequences by maximum parsimony revealed four major lineages or subtypes within the classical VSV IND (type 1) viruses, each with a distinct geographic distribution. A high degree of VSV genetic diversity was found in Central America, with several virus subtypes of both VSV IND and NJ serotypes existing in this mainly enzootic disease region. Nineteen percent sequence variation but no deletions or insertions were evident within the 5' noncoding and the coding regions of the VSV IND type 1 G genes. In addition to numerous base substitutions, the 3' noncoding regions of these viruses also contained numerous base insertions and deletions. This resulted in striking variation in G gene sizes, with gene lengths ranging from 1,652 to 1,868 nucleotides. As the VSV IND type 1 subtypes have diverged from the common ancestor with the NJ subtypes, their G mRNAs have accumulated more 3' noncoding sequence inserts, ranging up to 303 nucleotides in length. These primarily consist of an imprecise reiteration of the sequence UUUUUAA, apparently generated by a unique polymerase stuttering error. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence differences among VSV IND type 1 viruses revealed numerous substitutions within defined antigenic epitopes, suggesting that immune selection may play a role in the evolution of these viruses.</jats:p>",0

Ledantevirus: A Proposed New Genus in the Rhabdoviridae has a Strong Ecological Association with Bats,"<jats:p>The Le Dantec serogroup of rhabdoviruses comprises Le Dantec virus from a human with encephalitis and Keuriliba virus from rodents, each isolated in Senegal. The Kern Canyon serogroup comprises a loosely connected set of rhabdoviruses many of which have been isolated from bats, including Kern Canyon virus from California, Nkolbisson virus from Cameroon, Central African Republic, and Cote d'Ivoire, Kolente virus from Guinea, Mount Elgon bat and Fikirini viruses from Kenya, and Oita virus from Japan. Fukuoka virus isolated from mosquitoes, midges, and cattle in Japan, Barur virus from a rodent in India and Nishimuro virus from pigs in Japan have also been linked genetically or serologically to this group. Here, we analyze the genome sequences and phylogenetic relationships of this set of viruses.

Fatal Ulcerative and Hemorrhagic Typhlocolitis in a Pregnant Heifer Associated with Natural Bovine Enterovirus Type-1 Infection,"<jats:p> One 2-year-old, 7.5 months pregnant Aberdeen Angus out of a herd of 100 apparently healthy cows, died within 10 hours of hospitalization. At necropsy, multiple foci of mucosal hemorrhage and ulceration were observed in the spiral colon and cecum. Virus isolation from intestinal lesions yielded a cytopathic virus, which was revealed by electron microscopy to be an approximately 27 nm, nonenveloped virus. Further characterization by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), sequencing of the 5′UTR and partial VP1 coding region, and phylogenetic analysis classified the virus isolate as bovine enterovirus type 1 (BEV-1). No other significant pathogens were detected. This is the first report of BEV-1 isolated in the USA from an animal with fatal enteric disease in more than 20 years. Further investigation is required to determine the prevalence of BEV in North America and to establish the clinical relevance of this understudied virus. </jats:p>",0
Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Type 2-Induced Meningoencephalitis in a Heifer,"<jats:p> The brain from a 15-month-old, black female Angus, with a 48-hour history of central nervous system disease, was submitted to the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Microscopic findings consisted of acute, multifocal meningoencephalitis, with neuronal degeneration and necrosis and gliosis. Viral isolation yielded noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Virus genotyping classified the virus as BVDV type 2. Immunohistochemical labeling for BVDV antigens with BVD MAb 3.12F1 clone was prominent in the cytoplasm of neurons, glial cells, ependymal epithelium, perivascular macrophages and spindle cells, smooth muscle cells, and intravascular monocytes of the cerebrum and brain stem. Laboratory results support that tissue alterations occurred as a result of BVDV type 2 infection. In the absence of other clinical signs related to BVDV infection and using the microscopic and laboratory evidence presented, we propose that the BVDV type 2 isolated from this case may represent a neurovirulent strain of the virus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of brain lesions and neuronal viral antigen localization in BVDV genotype 2 viral infection, acquired either congenitally or postnatally. </jats:p>",0

Epitope-Blocking Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays for the Detection of Serum Antibodies to West Nile Virus in Multiple Avian Species,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>We report the development of epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the rapid detection of serum antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) in taxonomically diverse North American avian species. A panel of flavivirus-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was tested in blocking assays with serum samples from WNV-infected chickens and crows. Selected MAbs were further tested against serum samples from birds that represented 16 species and 10 families. Serum samples were collected from birds infected with WNV or Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and from noninfected control birds. Serum samples from SLEV-infected birds were included in these experiments because WNV and SLEV are closely related antigenically, are maintained in similar transmission cycles, and have overlapping geographic distributions. The ELISA that utilized MAb 3.1112G potentially discriminated between WNV and SLEV infections, as all serum samples from WNV-infected birds and none from SLEV-infected birds were positive in this assay. Assays with MAbs 2B2 and 6B6C-1 readily detected serum antibodies in all birds infected with WNV and SLEV, respectively, and in most birds infected with the other virus. Two other MAbs partially discriminated between infections with these two viruses. Serum samples from most WNV-infected birds but no SLEV-infected birds were positive with MAb 3.67G, while almost all serum samples from SLEV-infected birds but few from WNV-infected birds were positive with MAb 6B5A-5. The blocking assays reported here provide a rapid, reliable, and inexpensive diagnostic and surveillance technique to monitor WNV activity in multiple avian species.</jats:p>",0

Characterisation of the Virome of Tonsils from Conventional Pigs and from Specific Pathogen-Free Pigs,"<jats:p>Porcine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by a number of different microorganisms, as well as by non-infectious factors such as the management and environment of the animals. It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development.</jats:p>",0

Genetic characterization of bovine viral diarrhea viruses isolated from persistently infected calves born to dams vaccinated against bovine viral diarrhea virus before breeding,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Objective</jats:bold>—To collect and partially characterize strains of bovine viral diarrhea viruses(BVDVs) isolated from persistently infected (PI) calves born to vaccinated dams, determine genetic diversity of the isolated viruses, and identify regional distribution of genetically similar virus subpopulations.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Sample Population</jats:bold>—17 noncytopathic (NCP) BVDVs from PI calves from 11 herds of beef or dairy cattle.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Procedures</jats:bold>—Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures, and BVDV-specific PCR primers were used to amplify &gt; 1,000 bases of the viral genome. Derived sequences were used for molecular phylogenetic analyses to determine the viral genotype and viral genogroup and to assess genetic similarity among BVDVs.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>—Analysis of the 17 NCP strains of BVDV failed to detect a viral genotype or viral genogroup not already reported to exist in the United States. One virus was classified as genotype 1, genogroup 1b, and 16 viruses were classified as genotype 2, genogroup 2a. Genotype 2 strains were genetically diverse, and genetic similarities were not obvious among viruses from geographic regions larger than a small locale.</jats:p>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions and Clinical Relevance</jats:bold>—Viruses isolated from herds where a genotype 1, genogroup 1a BVDV vaccine was administered prior to breeding were primarily genetically diverse genotype 2, genogroup 2a BVDVs. Vaccination with multiple BVDV genotypes may be needed to improve protection. Methods used in this study to obtain and analyze field strains are applicable to assessing efficacy of current BVDV vaccines. Candidates for future vaccines are viruses that appear able to elude the immune response of cattle vaccinated against BVDV with existing vaccines.</jats:p>",0
Prevalence of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Genotypes and Antibody against those Viral Genotypes in Fetal Bovine Serum,<jats:p> One thousand lots of pooled fetal bovine serum (FBS) were tested for contamination with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and/or for contamination with neutralizing antibody against BVDV. Noncytopathic or cytopathic BVDV was isolated from 203 lots of FBS. Analysis of the viral isolates identified 115 type 1 and 65 type 2 BVDV isolates. An additional 23 virus isolates were mixtures of &gt;2 BVDV isolates and were not classified to viral genotype. Further characterization of the type 1 viruses identified 51 subgenotype 1a and 64 subgenotype 1b BVDV isolates. Viral neutralizing antibody was detected in 113 lots of FBS.

          <jats:p>
            Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) were identified and characterized in three avian genomes to gain insight into early retroviral evolution. Using the computer program RetroTector to detect relatively intact ERVs, we identified 500 ERVs in the chicken genome, 150 in the turkey genome, and 1,200 in the zebra finch genome. Previous studies suggested that endogenous alpharetroviruses were present in chicken genomes. In this analysis, a small number of alpharetroviruses were seen in the chicken and turkey genomes; however, these were greatly outnumbered by beta-like, gamma-like, and alphabeta proviruses. While the avian ERVs belonged to the same major groups as mammalian ERVs, they were more heterogeneous. In particular, the beta-like viruses revealed an evolutionary continuum with the gradual acquisition and loss of betaretroviral markers and a transition from beta to alphabeta and then to alpharetroviruses. Thus, it appears that birds may resemble a melting pot for early ERV evolution. Many of the ERVs were integrated in clusters on chromosomes, often near centromeres. About 25% of the chicken ERVs were in or near cellular transcription units; this is nearly random. The majority of these integrations were in the sense orientation in introns. A higher-than-random number of integrations were &gt;100 kb from the nearest gene. Deep-sequencing studies of chicken embryo fibroblasts revealed that about 20% of the 500 ERVs were transcribed and translated. A subset of these were also transcribed

            Studies of avian endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have given us a glimpse of an earlier retroviral world. Three different classes of ERVs were observed with many features of mammalian retroviruses, as well as some important differences. Many avian ERVs were transcribed and translated.

Identification and complete genome characterization of a novel picornavirus in turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),"<jats:p>Members of the family <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic> are important pathogens of humans and animals, although compared with the thousands of known bird species (&gt;10 000), only a few (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 11) picornaviruses have been identified from avian sources. This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples collected from eight turkey farms in Hungary. Using RT-PCR, both healthy (two of three) and affected (seven of eight) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome were shown to be shedding viruses in seven (88 %) of the eight farms. The viral genome sequence (turkey/M176/2011/HUN; GenBank accession no. JQ691613) shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (96 %) to the partial P3 genome region of a picornavirus reported recently in turkey and chickens from the USA and probably belongs to the same species. In the P1 and P2 regions, turkey/M176/2011/HUN is related most closely to, but distinct from, the kobuviruses and turdivirus 1. Complete genome analysis revealed the presence of characteristic picornaviral amino acid motifs, a potential type II-like 5′ UTR internal ribosome entry site (first identified among avian-origin picornaviruses) and a conserved, 48 nt long ‘barbell-like’ structure found at the 3′ UTR of turkey/M176/2011/HUN and members of the picornavirus genera <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Kobuvirus</jats:italic>. The general presence of turkey picornavirus – a novel picornavirus species – in faecal samples from healthy and affected turkeys in Hungary and in the USA suggests the worldwide occurrence and endemic circulation of this virus in turkey farms. Further studies are needed to investigate the aetiological role and pathogenic potential of this picornavirus in food animals.</jats:p>",0
Genetic characterization of a novel picornavirus in turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) distinct from turkey galliviruses and megriviruses and distantly related to the members of the genus Avihepatovirus,"<jats:p>This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples of healthy (1/3) and affected (6/8) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome in Hungary. The virus was detected at seven of the eight farms examined. The turkey/M176-TuASV/2011/HUN genome (KC465954) was genetically different from the currently known picornaviruses of turkey origin (megriviruses and galliviruses), and showed distant phylogenetic relationship and common genomic features (e.g. uncleaved VP0 and three predicted and unrelated 2A polypeptides) to duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) of the genus <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic>. The complete genome analysis revealed multiple distinct genome features like the presence of two in-tandem aphthovirus 2A-like sequence repeats with DxExNPG/P ‘ribosome-skipping’ sites (76 %, 23/30 amino acids identical), with the first aphthovirus 2A-like sequence being located at the end of the VP1 capsid protein (VP1/2A1 ‘ribosome-skipping’ site). The phylogenetic analyses, low sequence identity (33, 32 and 36 % amino acid identity in P1, P2 and P3 regions) to DHAV, and the type II-like internal ribosome entry site suggests that this turkey picornavirus is related to, but distinct from the genus <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> and it could be the founding member of a novel <jats:italic>Avihepatovirus</jats:italic> sister-clade genus.

Characterization of neutralization sites on the circulating variant of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV): a new site is shared by SVDV and the related coxsackie B5 virus,"<jats:p>Using a panel of new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), five neutralizing, conformation-dependent sites have been identified on the antigenic variant of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) circulating currently. In studies on the antigenic conservation of these sites, the four antigenic/genetic groups of SVDV described showed distinguishable patterns, confirming this classification. By sequencing mAb-resistant mutants, the five sites have been mapped precisely and localized on a three-dimensional model of the SVDV capsid. All were found to be orientated, to a different extent, towards the external surface of the capsid. Three of the five sites, located in VP1, VP2 and VP3, correspond to epitopes identified previously in historic isolates as sites 1, 2a and 3b, respectively. Another site, site IV, which maps to position 258 of VP1, corresponds to an epitope reported recently and is described in this study to be specific for isolates of the most recent antigenic group of SVDV. A fifth site is described for the first time and corresponds to the unique neutralizing site that is common to both SVDV and coxsackie B5 virus; it maps to positions 95 and 98 of VP1, but may also include positions nearby that belong to site 1 on the BC-loop of VP1, suggesting the classification of site Ia. These results may have useful diagnostic and epidemiological applications, since mAbs to the new conserved site Ia provide universal reagents for SVDV detection systems, while the specificity of mAbs to site IV make them unique markers for the most recent strains of SVDV.</jats:p>",0

Identical Consensus Sequence and Conserved Genomic Polymorphism of Hepatitis E Virus during Controlled Interspecies Transmission,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>High-throughput sequencing of bile and feces from two pigs experimentally infected with human hepatitis E virus (HEV) of genotype 3f revealed the same full-length consensus sequence as in the human sample. Twenty-nine percent of polymorphic sites found in HEV from the human sample were conserved throughout the infection of the heterologous host. The interspecies transmission of HEV quasispecies is the result of a genomic negative-selection pressure on random mutations which can be deleterious to the viral population. HEV intrahost nucleotide diversity was found to be in the lower range of other human RNA viruses but correlated with values found for zoonotic viruses. HEV transmission between humans and pigs does not seem to be modulated by host-specific mutations, suggesting that adaptation is mainly regulated by ecological drivers.</jats:p>",0

Neurotropic Astrovirus in Cattle with Nonsuppurative Encephalitis in Europe,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Encephalitis is a frequently diagnosed condition in cattle with neurological diseases. Many affected animals present with a nonsuppurative inflammatory reaction pattern in the brain. While this pattern supports a viral etiology, the causative pathogen remains unknown in a large proportion of cases. Using viral metagenomics, we identified an astrovirus (bovine astrovirus [BoAstV]-CH13) in the brain of a cow with nonsuppurative encephalitis. Additionally, BoAstV RNA was detected with reverse transcription-PCR and
            <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
            hybridization in about one fourth (5/22 animals) of cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis of unknown etiology. Viral RNA was found primarily in neurons and at the site of pathology. These findings support the notion that BoAstV infection is a common cause of encephalitis in cattle. Phylogenetically, BoAstV-CH13 was closely related to rare astrovirus isolates from encephalitis cases in animals and a human patient. Future research needs to be directed toward the pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiology, and potential cross-species transmission of these neurotropic astroviruses.

Infection of guinea pigs with the New World arenavirus<jats:italic>Pichindé virus</jats:italic>(PICV) has been used as a biosafety level 2 model for the<jats:italic>Lassa virus</jats:italic>. Despite continuing research, little is known about the molecular basis of pathogenesis, and this has hindered the design of novel antiviral therapeutics. Modulation of the host response is a potential strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases. We have previously investigated the global host response to attenuated and lethal arenavirus infections by using high-throughput immunoblotting and kinomics approaches. In this report, we describe the differential nuclear proteomes of a murine cell line induced by mock infection and infection with attenuated and lethal variants of PICV, investigated by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Spot identification using tandem mass spectrometry revealed the involvement of a number of proteins that regulate inflammation via potential modulation of NF-κB activity and of several heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear proteins. Pathway analysis revealed a potential role for transcription factor XBP-1, a transcription factor involved in major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) expression; differential DNA-binding activity was revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and differences in surface MHC-II expression were seen following PICV infection. These data are consistent with the results of several previous studies and highlight potential differences between transcriptional and translational regulation. This study provides a number of differentially expressed targets for further research and suggests that key events in pathogenesis may be established early in infection.</jats:p>",0
Genomic Sequences of Australian Bluetongue Virus Prototype Serotypes Reveal Global Relationships and Possible Routes of Entry into Australia,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>

            Bluetongue virus (BTV) is transmitted by biting midges (
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Culicoides</jats:named-content>
            spp.). It causes disease mainly in sheep and occasionally in cattle and other species. BTV has spread into northern Europe, causing disease in sheep and cattle. The introduction of new serotypes, changes in vector species, and climate change have contributed to these changes. Ten BTV serotypes have been isolated in Australia without apparent associated disease. Simplified methods for preferential isolation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and template preparation enabled high-throughput sequencing of the 10 genome segments of all Australian BTV prototype serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis reinforced the Western and Eastern topotypes previously characterized but revealed unique features of several Australian BTVs. Many of the Australian BTV genome segments (Seg-) were closely related, clustering together within the Eastern topotypes. A novel Australian topotype for Seg-5 (NS1) was identified, with taxa spread across several serotypes and over time. Seg-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -9, and -10 of BTV_2_AUS_2008 were most closely related to the cognate segments of viruses from Taiwan and Asia and not other Australian viruses, supporting the conclusion that BTV_2 entered Australia recently. The Australian BTV_15_AUS_1982 prototype was revealed to be unusual among the Australian BTV isolates, with Seg-3 and -8 distantly related to other BTV sequences from all serotypes.

Few complete genome sequences of influenza A viruses from Europe are publicly available at the present time and there have been few longitudinal genome studies of human influenza A viruses. We have studied the evolution of circulating human H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006, we analysed 234 Danish human influenza A viruses and characterised 24 complete genomes.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>H3N2 was the prevalent strain in Denmark during the study period, but H1N1 dominated the 2000–2001 season. H1N2 viruses were first observed in Denmark in 2002–2003. After years of little genetic change in the H1N1 viruses the 2005–2006 season presented H1N1 of greater variability than before. This indicates that H1N1 viruses are evolving and that H1N1 soon is likely to be the prevalent strain again. Generally, the influenza A haemagglutinin (HA) of H3N2 viruses formed seasonal phylogenetic clusters. Different lineages co-circulating within the same season were also observed. The evolution has been stochastic, influenced by small ""jumps"" in genetic distance rather than constant drift, especially with the introduction of the Fujian-like viruses in 2002–2003. Also evolutionary stasis-periods were observed which might indicate well fit viruses. The evolution of H3N2 viruses have also been influenced by gene reassortments between lineages from different seasons. None of the influenza genes were influenced by strong positive selection pressure. The antigenic site B in H3N2 HA was the preferred site for genetic change during the study period probably because the site A has been masked by glycosylations. Substitutions at CTL-epitopes in the genes coding for the neuraminidase (NA), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein 1 (M1), non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and especially the nucleoprotein (NP) were observed. The N-linked glycosylation pattern varied during the study period and the H3N2 isolates from 2004 to 2006 were highly glycosylated with ten predicted sequons in HA, the highest amount of glycosylations observed in this study period.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>The present study is the first to our knowledge to characterise the evolution of complete genomes of influenza A H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 isolates from Europe over a time period of seven years from 1999 to 2006.

Molecular Analysis of H7 Avian Influenza Viruses from Australia and New Zealand: Genetic Diversity and Relationships from 1976 to 2007,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Full-genome sequencing of 11 Australian and 1 New Zealand avian influenza A virus isolate (all subtype H7) has enabled comparison of the sequences of each of the genome segments to those of other subtype H7 avian influenza A viruses. The inference of phylogenetic relationships for each segment has been used to develop a model of the natural history of these viruses in Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin segment indicates that the Australian H7 isolates form a monophyletic clade. This pattern is consistent with the long-term, independent evolution that is, in this instance, associated with geographic regions. On the basis of the analysis of the other H7 hemagglutinin sequences, three other geographic regions for which similar monophyletic clades have been observed were confirmed. These regions are Eurasia plus Africa, North America, and South America. Analysis of the neuraminidase sequences from the H7N1, H7N3, and H7N7 genomes revealed the same region-based relationships. This pattern of independent evolution of Australian isolates is supported by the results of analysis of each of the six remaining genomic segments. These results, in conjunction with the occurrence of five different combinations of neuraminidase subtypes (H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N6, H7N7) among the 11 Australian isolates, suggest that the maintenance host(s) is nearly exclusively associated with Australia. The single lineage of Australian H7 hemagglutinin sequences, despite the occurrence of multiple neuraminidase types, suggests the existence of a genetic pool from which a variety of reassortants arise rather than the presence of a small number of stable viral clones. This pattern of evolution is likely to occur in each of the regions mentioned above.</jats:p>",0
Influence of the hepatitis C virus 3′‐untranslated region on IRES‐dependent and cap‐dependent translation initiation,"<jats:p>Translation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic RNA is directed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5′‐untranslated region (5′‐UTR), and the HCV 3′‐UTR enhances IRES activity. Since the HCV 3′‐UTR has a unique structure among 3′‐UTRs, we checked possible communication between the 5′‐ and the 3′‐UTR of HCV during translation using chimeric reporter RNAs. We show that translation directed by the HCV IRES and by the HCV‐like IRES of porcine teschovirus (PTV) which belongs to a quite distinct family of viruses (picornaviruses) or by the EMCV IRES is also enhanced by the HCV 3′‐UTR or by a poly(A)‐tail in different cell types.</jats:p>",0

METHODS: A survey was performed on the number of bats that had been sent for diagnosis by the Seção de Virologia of the Instituto Municipal de Medicina Veterinária Jorge Vaitsman and were positive for rabies. The positive animals were identified, and the isolated viruses were sent for antigenic typification with indirect immunofluorescence. The results were compared with the antigenic panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: During 2001-2010, the laboratory received 555 non-hematophagous bats for rabies diagnosis, with 198 (35.7%) from Rio de Janeiro City. A total of 11 (5.5%) animals were positive for this disease. Antigenic typification revealed the predominance of variant 3 in 9 (81.8%) of the isolated viruses; 1 virus was classified as variant 4 and 1 variant was identified that segregated with the viruses in insectivorous bats. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained in this study showed the presence of the rabies virus in synanthropic populations of non-hematophagous bats in the City of Rio de Janeiro. The circulation of this agent in these animals represents a serious risk to human and animal health and requires attention and control measures by the authorities.</jats:p>",0
Molecular epidemiology of enterovirus and parechovirus infections according to patient age over a 4‐year period in Spain,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>The epidemiology and clinical association of enterovirus (EV) and parechovirus (HPeV) infections, as well as the type‐distribution‐according‐to‐age, were determined during a 4‐year study period in Spain. During 2010–2013, a total of 21,832 clinical samples were screened for EV and the detection frequency was 6.5% (1,430). Of the total EV‐negative samples, only 1,873 samples from 2011 to 2013 were available for HPeV testing. HPeV was detected in 42 (2%) of them. Positive samples were genotyped using PCR and sequencing. EV infections occurred in all age groups of patients: neonates (17%), children 28 days to 2 years (29%), children 2–14 years (40%), and adults (14%). Thirty‐four different EV types were identified. HPeV infections were detected exclusively in infants &lt;8 m (70% neonates, <jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.05). All but one HPeV were HPeV‐3. Differences in type frequency detection were found according to age and clinical manifestation. Coxsackievirus (CV)‐B4 (61%), CV‐B5 (83%), and HPeV‐3 (64%) were more frequent in neonates than in older patients (<jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.05). Echovirus (E)‐3 (60%), E‐18 (47%), E‐25 (62%), CV‐A6 (61%), CV‐A16 (72%), and EV‐71 (75%) were mainly detected in children 28 days to 2 years (<jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.05), whereas, E‐6 (79%), E‐20 (88%), and E‐30 (85%) were predominant in children &gt;2 years and adults (<jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.05). Clinically, meningitis was associated with EV (<jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.01) whereas, encephalitis was more frequent in HPeV‐infected patients. CV‐B types were associated with myocarditis (90%; <jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.05) and EV species A with hand–foot–mouth‐disease/atypical exanthema (88%; <jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.05). <jats:bold><jats:italic>J.

Identification and Analysis of Differentially-Expressed microRNAs in Japanese Encephalitis Virus-Infected PK-15 Cells with Deep Sequencing,"<jats:p>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne Flavivirus, causes acute viral encephalitis with high morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that are important modulators of the intricate  host-pathogen interaction networks. However, our knowledge of the changes that occur in miRNAs in host cells after JEV infection is still limited. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of JEV at the level of posttranscriptional regulation, we used Illumina deep sequencing to sequence two small RNA libraries prepared from PK-15 cells before and after JEV infection. We identified 522 and 427 miRNAs in the infected and uninfected cells, respectively. Overall, 132 miRNAs were expressed significantly differently after challenge with JEV: 78 were upregulated and 54 downregulated. The sequencing results for selected miRNAs were confirmed with RT-qPCR. GO analysis of the host target genes revealed that these dysregulated miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, including the metabolic pathway, inflammatory response and immune response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the comparative expression of miRNAs in PK-15 cells after JEV infection. Our findings will underpin further studies of miRNAs’ roles in JEV replication and identify potential candidates for antiviral therapies against JEV.</jats:p>",0

First detection and molecular characterization of<i>Nebovirus</i>in Brazil,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Nebovirus</jats:italic>is a new genus of viruses belonging to the Caliciviridae family recently characterized in cattle, and is associated with gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhoea, anorexia and intestinal lesions particularly in calves. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of neboviruses in Brazilian cattle and analyse phylogenetically the virus strains detected. A prevalence of 4·8% of neboviruses in faecal samples from 62 head of cattle from different Brazilian states was detected. All positive animals were aged &lt;20 days and had diarrhoea. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the virus sequences into the Newbury1 clade. There was &gt;96·0% nt (100% aa) sequence identity between the virus sequences in this study and &gt;88·8% nt (&gt;94·4% aa) identity with Newbury1/UK. Our results indicate, for the first time, the occurrence of neboviruses in Brazil as well as in South America, and the first Newbury1-like nebovirus found outside the UK.</jats:p>",0

Outbreak of swine influenza in Argentina reveals a non-contemporary human H3N2 virus highly transmissible among pigs,"<jats:p>Sporadic outbreaks of human H3N2 influenza A virus (IAV) infections in swine populations have been reported in Asia, Europe and North America since 1970. In South America, serological surveys in pigs indicate that IAVs of the H3 and H1 subtypes are currently in circulation; however, neither virus isolation nor characterization has been reported. In November 2008, an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs consistent with swine influenza virus (SIV) infection was detected in Argentina. The current study describes the clinical epidemiology, pathology, and molecular and biological characteristics of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus isolate shared nucleotide identities of 96–98 % with H3N2 IAVs that circulated in humans from 2000 to 2003. Antigenically, sera from experimentally inoculated animals cross-reacted mainly with non-contemporary human-origin H3N2 influenza viruses. In an experimental infection in a commercial swine breed, the virus was of low virulence but was transmitted efficiently to contact pigs and caused severe disease when an infected animal acquired a secondary bacterial infection. This is the first report of a wholly human H3N2 IAV associated with clinical disease in pigs in South America. These studies highlight the importance of two-way transmission of IAVs and SIVs between pigs and humans, and call for enhanced influenza surveillance in the pig population worldwide.</jats:p>",0
Newcastle disease outbreaks in Italy during 2000,"<jats:p>Among the consequences of the epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza which affected Italy between 1999 and 2000 was an epidemic of Newcastle disease in northern and central Italy. It affected industrially reared poultry, dealer flocks and backyard flocks, with a total of 254 outbreaks notified up to December 31, 2000. Virological investigations yielded virulent isolates of Newcastle disease virus, which produced intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 and which, on the basis of their monoclonal antibody binding patterns, could be classified as belonging to group Cl. The clinical, gross and microscopical findings were typical of Newcastle disease, and different avian species were susceptible to different degrees. Chickens and guinea fowl appeared to be the most susceptible, followed by pheasants, turkeys and ostriches. The epidemiological inquiry highlighted the crucial role of a broiler hatchery in initiating the epidemic, and of dealers in perpetuating it. The control measures imposed by Directive 92/66/EEC are discussed with reference to the outbreaks in backyard flocks.</jats:p>",0

An outbreak of pseudocowpox in fattening calves in southern Brazil,"<jats:p> Pseudocowpox virus is a parapoxvirus frequently associated with papulovesicular and scabby lesions on the teats and udders of milking cows and is often transmitted to human beings. An unusual outbreak of skin disease in fattening calves in southern Brazil is described. Fourteen of 17 male cattle (82%), aged 6–48 months, feeding on grass pastures were affected. Animals developed papules, vesicles, and scabby proliferative lesions on the muzzle in a clinical course of approximately 10–15 days. The scabby lesions often presented with exudation and bleeding. Histological examination of mucocutaneous tissue in detached scabs revealed acanthosis with thickening of the corneal layer and premature keratinization (parakeratotic hyperkeratosis). The dermis had multifocal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. Electron microscopic examination of scab specimens revealed typical parapoxvirus particles: oval shaped (260 nm × 160 nm), enveloped, and covered with a helical layer. Polymerase chain reaction using a set of pan-parapoxvirus primers for the B2L gene amplified a 590-bp product out of DNA extracted from scabs. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplicons revealed a nucleotide homology of 97% with Pseudocowpox virus and lower homology with other parapoxviruses: Bovine papular stomatitis virus (84%) and Orf virus (94%). A phylogenetic tree based on the B2L sequence was constructed, showing that the virus clustered with Pseudocowpox virus isolates. </jats:p>",0

Bovine Papillomavirus in Brazil: Detection of Coinfection of Unusual Types by a PCR-RFLP Method,"<jats:p>Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) is recognized as a causal agent of benign and malignant tumors in cattle. Thirteen types of BPV are currently characterized and classified into three distinct genera, associated with different pathological outcomes. The described BPV types as well as other putative ones have been demonstrated by molecular biology methods, mainly by the employment of degenerated PCR primers. Specifically, divergences in the nucleotide sequence of the L1 gene are useful for the identification and classification of new papillomavirus types. On the present work, a method based on the PCR-RFLP technique and DNA sequencing was evaluated as a screening tool, allowing for the detection of two relatively rare types of BPV in lesions samples from a six-year-old Holstein dairy cow, chronically affected with cutaneous papillomatosis. These findings point to the dissemination of BPVs with unclear pathogenic potential, since two relatively rare, new described BPV types, which were first characterized in Japan, were also detected in Brazil.</jats:p>",0

Human hepatitis E virus circulation in Bulgaria: Deep Bayesian phylogenetic analysis for viral spread control in the country,"<jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in Bulgaria is endemic, as demonstrated by the seroprevalence of antibody against the virus in the general population and by the high prevalence of clinical cases registered. In this study, a deep Bayesian phylogenetic analysis has been performed to provide information on the genetic diversity and the spread of HEV genotypes in Bulgaria. Three different data sets of HEV virus was built for genotyping by the maximum likelihood method, for evolutionary rate estimated by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, for demographic history investigation and for selective pressure analysis. The evolutionary rate for genotype 3e, was 351 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> substitution/site/year (95% highest posterior density [95% HPD]: 145 × 10
<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>‐575 × 10
<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>). The root of the time to the most recent common ancestor of the Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree of HEV 3e genotype corresponded to 1965 (HPD 95% 1949‐1994). The Bulgarian sequences mainly clustered in the main clade (clade A). The monophyletic clade included all Bulgarian genotype 3e sequences. The demographic history showed a slight growth from 1995 to 2000, followed by a sort of bottleneck in 2010s, a peak in 2011 and a new growth to 2015. Selection pressure analysis did not show sites under positive pressure but 64 statistically significant sites under negative selection. Molecular epidemiological surveillance by Bayesian phylogeny of HEV virus can contribute to trace the way of human infection after contact with swine source directly or heating meat improving public health control.</jats:p>",0

Taxon ordering in phylogenetic trees by means of evolutionary algorithms,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>In in a typical ""left-to-right"" phylogenetic tree, the vertical order of taxa is meaningless, as only the branch path between them reflects their degree of similarity. To make unresolved trees more informative, here we propose an innovative Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) method to search the best graphical representation of unresolved trees, in order to give a biological meaning to the vertical order of taxa.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Starting from a West Nile virus phylogenetic tree, in a (1 + 1)-EA we evolved it by randomly rotating the internal nodes and selecting the tree with better fitness every generation. The fitness is a sum of genetic distances between the considered taxon and the <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> (radius) next taxa. After having set the radius to the best performance, we evolved the trees with (<jats:italic>λ</jats:italic> + <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>)-EAs to study the influence of population on the algorithm.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>The trees after the evolution showed an improvement both of the fitness (based on a genetic distance matrix, then close taxa are actually genetically close), and of the biological interpretation.

"Analysis of genomic sequences of 95 papillomavirus types: uniting typing, phylogeny, and taxonomy","<jats:p>Our aim was to study the phylogenetic relationships of all known papillomaviruses (PVs) and the possibility of establishing a supratype taxonomic classification based on this information. Of the many detectably homologous segments present in PV genomes, a 291-bp segment of the L1 gene is notable because it is flanked by the MY09 and MY11 consensus primers and contains highly conserved amino acid residues which simplify sequence alignment. We determined the MY09-MY11 sequences of human PV type 20 (HPV-20), HPV-21, HPV-22, HPV-23, HPV-24, HPV-36, HPV-37, HPV-38, HPV-48, HPV-50, HPV-60, HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, ovine (sheep) PV, bovine PV type 3 (BPV-3), BPV-5, and BPV-6 and created a database which now encompasses HPV-1 to HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, seven yet untyped HPV genomes, and 15 animal PV types. Three additional animal PVs were analyzed on the basis of other sequence data. We constructed phylogenies based on partial L1 and E6 gene sequences and distinguished five major clades that we call supergroups. One of them unites 54 genital PV types, which can be further divided into eleven groups. The second supergroup has 24 types and unites most PVs that are typically found in epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients but also includes several types typical of other cutaneous lesions, like HPV-4. The third supergroup unites the six known ungulate fibropapillomaviruses, the fourth includes the cutaneous ungulate PVs BPV-3, BPV-4, and BPV-6, and the fifth includes HPV-1, HPV-41, HPV-63, the canine oral PV, and the cottontail rabbit PV. The chaffinch PV and two rodent PVs, Micromys minutus PV and Mastomys natalensis PV, are left ungrouped because of the relative isolation of each of their lineages. Within most supergroups, groups formed on the basis of cladistic principles unite phenotypically similar PV types. We discuss the basis of our classification, the concept of the PV type, speciation, PV-host evolution, and estimates of their rates of evolution.</jats:p>",0

Dual Infection of Gnotobiotic Calves with Bovine Strains of Group A and Porcine-Like Group C Rotaviruses Influences Pathogenesis of the Group C Rotavirus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>There is serological evidence that bovine group C rotaviruses exist in the United States, but there are no reports of their isolation. Ninety fecal samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from healthy adult cows were tested for group C rotaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immune electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Three samples from adult cow diarrhea cases were positive only by RT-PCR, and a group C rotavirus was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney (MA104) cells (WD534tc/C). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden porcine group C strain than to the Shintoku bovine strain. Because the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual-rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis and host adaptation of rotaviruses. Thus, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or combined with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotaviruses in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea without (or with limited) virus shedding in inoculated calves (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 3). In contrast, all calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 3) developed diarrhea but did not shed either virus. Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), whereas dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more-widespread small intestinal lesions occurred in calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotaviruses enhanced fecal shedding of a bovine group C rotavirus and the extent of histopathological lesions in the small intestines. Thus, our findings suggest a potential novel hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species.</jats:p>",0

Little is known about the prevalence of TTMV in humans. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women. This study aimed to estimate the TTMV infection frequency in cervicitis cases and cervical tumors including intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma, and the possible role of this virus in the etiology of them in an Isfahan population. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 79 cervicitis cases and 42 tumors were collected from histopathological files of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. DNA was extracted and subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Totally 62% of the tested samples were positive for TTMV. It was positive in 52.4% of adenocarcinoma, 68.4% of CIN and 100% SCC cases. In cervicitis, 48% of the cases were positive. In the phylogenetic construct two of the cervical tumor isolates and two of the cervicitis isolates were placed in the same cluster with already reported isolates from Japan (EF538880 and AB041962). Also, three of the cervical tumors isolated (JQ734980, JQ734981 and JQ734982) were placed in another cluster. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The presence of the virus in cervical tissues suggests possible sexual transmission of the virus.</jats:p>",0

Transfer of Viral Communities between Human Individuals during Fecal Microbiota Transplantation,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Clostridium difficile</jats:named-content>
            infections. However, concerns persist about unwanted cotransfer of pathogenic microbes such as viruses. Here we studed FMT from a single healthy human donor to three pediatric ulcerative colitis patients, each of whom received a course of 22 to 30 FMT treatments. Viral particles were purified from donor and recipient stool samples and sequenced; the reads were then assembled into contigs corresponding to viral genomes or partial genomes. Transfer of selected viruses was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Viral contigs present in the donor could be readily detected in recipients, with up to 32 different donor viral contigs appearing in a recipient sample. Reassuringly, none of these were viruses are known to replicate on human cells. Instead, viral contigs either scored as bacteriophage or could not be attributed taxonomically, suggestive of unstudied phage. The two most frequently transferred gene types were associated with temperate-phage replication. In addition, members of
            <jats:italic>Siphoviridae</jats:italic>
            , the group of typically temperate phages that includes phage lambda, were found to be transferred with significantly greater efficiency than other groups. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the temperate-phage replication style may promote efficient phage transfer between human individuals. In summary, we documented transfer of multiple viral lineages between human individuals through FMT, but in this case series, none were from viral groups known to infect human cells.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Transfer of whole communities of viruses between humans has rarely been studied but is of likely medical importance. Here we studied fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly successful treatment for relapsing
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Clostridium difficile</jats:named-content>
            infection and, potentially, other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We investigated the transfer of viral communities during FMT and documented transfer of multiple viral lineages between humans. None of these were viruses that replicated on animal cells or that are known to be pathogenic. We found that temperate bacteriophage, which form stable associations with their hosts, were significantly more likely to be transferred during FMT. This supports a model in which the viral temperate replication style may have evolved in part to support efficient viral transmission between environments.

Complete Genome Sequence of Newcastle Disease Virus Mesogenic Vaccine Strain R2B from India,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Mesogenic vaccine strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are widely used in many countries of Asia and Africa to control the Newcastle disease of poultry. In India, the mesogenic strain R2B was introduced in 1945; it protects adult chickens that have been preimmunized with a lentogenic vaccine virus and provides long-lasting immunity. In this article, we report the complete genome sequence of the hitherto unsequenced Indian vaccine virus strain R2B. The viral genome is 15,186 nucleotides in length and contains the polybasic amino acid motif in the fusion protein cleavage site, indicating that this vaccine strain has evolved from a virulent virus. Phylogenetic analysis of this mesogenic vaccine virus classified it with the viruses belonging to genotype III of the class cluster II of NDV.</jats:p>",0
Minimum Core Genome Sequence Typing of Bacterial Pathogens: a Unified Approach for Clinical and Public Health Microbiology,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>

            Bacterial pathogens impose a heavy health burden worldwide. In the new era of high-throughput sequencing and online bioinformatics, real-time genome typing of infecting agents, and in particular those with potential severe clinical outcomes, holds promise for guiding clinical care to limit the detrimental effects of infections and to prevent potential local or global outbreaks. Here, we sequenced and compared 85 isolates of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Streptococcus suis</jats:named-content>
            , a zoonotic human and swine pathogen, wherein we analyzed 32 recognized serotypes and 75 sequence types representing the diversity of the species and the human clinical isolates with high public health significance. We found that 1,077 of the 2,469 genes are shared by all isolates. Excluding 201 common but mobile genes, 876 genes were defined as the minimum core genome (MCG) of the species. Of 190,894 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, 58,501 were located in the MCG genes and were referred to as MCG SNPs. A population structure analysis of these MCG SNPs classified the 85 isolates into seven MCG groups, of which MCG group 1 includes all isolates from human infections and outbreaks. Our MCG typing system for
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">S. suis</jats:named-content>
            provided a clear separation of groups containing human-associated isolates from those containing animal-associated isolates. It also separated the group containing outbreak isolates, including those causing life-threatening streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, from sporadic or less severe meningitis or bacteremia-only isolates. The typing system facilitates the application of genome data to the fields of clinical medicine and epidemiology and to the surveillance of

Complete genome characterization of a rotavirus B (RVB) strain identified in Alpine goat kids with enteritis reveals inter-species transmission with RVB bovine strains,"<jats:p>Rotavirus B (RVB) has been associated with enteric disease in many animal species. An RVB strain was identified in pooled intestinal samples from Alpine caprine kids (between 2 and 3 days of age) experiencing high (&gt;90 %) morbidity, and the complete caprine RVB genome was characterized. Histology revealed villus atrophy, the samples tested positive for RVB by real-time RT-PCR and metagenomic next-generation sequencing identified only RVB and orf virus. In the VP4 gene segment, the caprine RVB strain had a higher percentage nucleotide identity to the Indian bovine RVB strains than to the Japanese bovine RVB strains, but the VP7, VP6, VP2, NSP1, NSP2 and NSP5 gene segments of the American caprine RVB strain were genetically related to the Japanese bovine RVB strains. The results indicate a lack of RVB sequences to understand reassortment or the evolutionary relationship of RVB strains from cattle and goats.</jats:p>",0

"A novel astrovirus species in the gut of yaks with diarrhoea in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, 2013","<jats:p>The yak (<jats:italic>Bos grunniens</jats:italic>) is an iconic symbol in the high-altitude region of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Diarrhoea is a common disease in yaks, resulting in major economic losses. To investigate the diversity of viral species, we reported the metagenomics-derived virome in a pooled faecal sample of 20 diarrhoeic yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhoeic samples, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, were influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared with healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrhoeal samples, indicating a correlation with the clinical symptoms of diarrhoea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a near-full genome was obtained from a diarrhoeic sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4–66.2 % similarity with other related bovine AstVs from faeces. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome demonstrated that the yak AstV fell within the bovine AstVs cluster, but was located in a unique lineage, suggesting a novel AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had closer similarity and genetically relationship with deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than that of the bovine AstVs. Further analysis showed that one possible interspecies recombination event occurred in <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""uri"" xlink:href=""http://ORF2"">ORF2</jats:ext-link>.

In total, 18 new vertebrate viruses, including novel sapelovirus, astroviruses, bocaviruses, papillomaviruses and gammaherpesvirus were identified, as well as known mammalian pathogens including rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2). Captive devils showed significantly lower levels of viral diversity than wild devils.

Structural analysis of electrophoretic variation in the genome profiles of rotavirus field isolates,"<jats:p>Detailed structural studies were undertaken on five isolates of bovine rotavirus which showed variability in the migration patterns of their genome segments on electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. The individual genome segments of each isolate were characterized by partial digestion of terminally radiolabeled RNA with a base-specific nuclease. This analysis showed that whereas mobility variations were always associated with detectable changes in nucleotide sequence, sequence changes at least as great as those found in segments showing electrophoretic mobility variations were also detected in segments showing no mobility variation. Evidence for the occurrence of genome segment reassortment between viruses in the field was obtained from analyzing the species 11 RNAs from these five isolates. The overall conclusion from these results is that great care is required in the interpretation of simple genome profile analysis of different isolates for epidemiological purposes and that classification of these viruses solely on the basis of genome electropherotype could be misleading.</jats:p>",0
Identification and Analysis of the First 2009 Pandemic H1N1 Influenza Virus from U.S. Feral Swine,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The first case of pandemic H1N1 influenza (pH1N1) virus in feral swine in the United States was identified in Texas through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services’ surveillance program. Two samples were identified as pandemic influenza by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT‐qPCR). Full‐genome Sanger sequencing of all eight influenza segments was performed. In addition, Illumina deep sequencing of the original diagnostic samples and their respective virus isolation cultures were performed to assess the feasibility of using an unbiased whole‐genome linear target amplification method and multiple sample sequencing in a single Illumina GAIIx lane. Identical sequences were obtained using both techniques. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all gene segments belonged to the pH1N1 (2009) lineage. In conclusion, we have identified the first pH1N1 isolate in feral swine in the United States and have demonstrated the use of an easy unbiased linear amplification method for deep sequencing of multiple samples.</jats:p>",0

            strains by the resistance of their hemagglutinins to trypsin treatment and their inability to recover hemagglutinating capacity after removal of dithiothreitol from treated virus preparations. In these respects, the equine strain most closely resembled the Hong Kong variants. The pattern of hemagglutination inactivation also set the swine, PR8, and CAME strains apart from each other as well as from the other five strains. The results suggest that separation of type A viruses into groups by the pattern of inactivation of their hemagglutinins may be a valuable adjunct to standard serology for a more definite classification of these viruses.

Beyond the gut bacterial microbiota: The gut virome,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>The gastrointestinal tract is colonized with a highly different population of bacterial, viral, ad fungal species; viruses are reported to be dominant. The composition of gut virome is closely related to dietary habits and surrounding environment. Host and their intestinal microbes live in a dynamic equilibrium and viruses stimulate a low degree of immune responses without causing symptoms (host tolerance). However, intestinal phages could lead to a rupture of eubiosis and may contribute to the shift from health to disease in humans and animals. Viral nucleic acids and other products of lysis of bacteria serve as pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and could trigger specific inflammatory modulations. At the same time, phages could elicit innate antiviral immune responses. Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) operated as innate antiviral immune sensors and their activation triggers signaling cascades that lead to inflammatory response. <jats:bold><jats:italic>J. Med.

Modular approach to customise sample preparation procedures for viral metagenomics: a reproducible protocol for virome analysis,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A major limitation for better understanding the role of the human gut virome in health and disease is the lack of validated methods that allow high throughput virome analysis. To overcome this, we evaluated the quantitative effect of homogenisation, centrifugation, filtration, chloroform treatment and random amplification on a mock-virome (containing nine highly diverse viruses) and a bacterial mock-community (containing four faecal bacterial species) using quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing. This resulted in an optimised protocol that was able to recover all viruses present in the mock-virome and strongly alters the ratio of viral versus bacterial and 16S rRNA genetic material in favour of viruses (from 43.2% to 96.7% viral reads and from 47.6% to 0.19% bacterial reads). Furthermore, our study indicated that most of the currently used virome protocols, using small filter pores and/or stringent centrifugation conditions may have largely overlooked large viruses present in viromes. We propose NetoVIR (<jats:underline>N</jats:underline>ovel <jats:underline>e</jats:underline>nrichment <jats:underline>t</jats:underline>echnique <jats:underline>o</jats:underline>f <jats:underline>VIR</jats:underline>omes), which allows for a fast, reproducible and high throughput sample preparation for viral metagenomics studies, introducing minimal bias. This procedure is optimised mainly for faecal samples, but with appropriate concentration steps can also be used for other sample types with lower initial viral loads.</jats:p>",0

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepacivirus</jats:named-content>
            ) is a highly relevant human pathogen. Unique hepaciviruses (HV) were discovered recently in animal hosts. The direct ancestor of HCV has not been found, but the genetically most closely related animal HVs exist in horses. To investigate whether other peridomestic animals also carry HVs, we analyzed sera from Ghanaian cattle for HVs by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Nine of 106 specimens from different sampling sites contained HV RNA (8.5%) at median viral loads of 1.6 × 10
            <jats:sup>5</jats:sup>
            copies/ml. Infection seemed unrelated to cattle age and gender. Near-full-genome sequencing of five representative viruses confirmed taxonomic classifications. Cattle HVs formed two distinct phylogenetic lineages that differed by up to 17.7% on the nucleotide level in the polyprotein-encoding region, suggesting cocirculation of different virus subtypes. A conserved microRNA122-binding site in the 5′ internal ribosomal entry site suggested liver tropism of cattle HVs. Phylogenetic analyses suggested the circulation of HVs in cattle for several centuries. Cattle HVs were genetically highly divergent from all other HVs, including HCV. HVs from genetically related equine and bovine hosts were not monophyletic, corroborating host shifts during the evolution of the genus
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepacivirus</jats:named-content>
            . Similar to equine HVs, the genetic diversity of cattle HVs was low compared to that of HCV genotypes. This suggests an influence of the human-modified ecology of peridomestic animals on virus diversity. Further studies should investigate the occurrence of cattle HVs in other geographic areas and breeds, virus pathogenicity in cattle, and the potential exposure of human risk groups, such as farmers, butchers, and abattoir workers.

            ) is a major human pathogen, causing liver failure and cancer. Unique hepaciviruses (HVs) were discovered over the last few years in animals, but the direct ancestor of HCV has not been found. The animal HV most closely related to HCV so far originated from horses, suggesting that other livestock animals also harbor HVs. Therefore, we investigated African cattle and discovered previously unknown HVs at high prevalence and viral loads. Because of the agricultural importance of cattle, it may be relevant to investigate HV pathogenicity. The frequent exposure of humans to cattle also may warrant investigations of the zoonotic potential of these viruses. Evolutionary analyses suggested that cattle HVs have existed for centuries. Despite the genetic relatedness of their animal hosts, HVs from cattle and horses were not phylogenetically related, corroborating frequent host shifts during the evolution of the genus

Pseudorabies virus infection in Oklahoma hunting dogs,"<jats:p> Pseudorabies is caused by Suid herpesvirus 1, a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. Although pigs are the natural host of Pseudorabies virus (PRV), the virus has a broad host range and may cause fatal encephalitis in many species. The United States obtained PRV-free status in 2004 after the virus was eradicated from domestic swineherds, but the virus is still present in feral swine populations. The current report describes PRV infection in 3 dogs that were used to hunt feral swine. The dogs developed clinical signs including facial pruritus with facial abrasions, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, ataxia, muscle stiffness, and death. Two were euthanized, and 1 died within approximately 48 hr after onset of clinical signs. The salient histologic changes consisted of neutrophilic trigeminal ganglioneuritis with neuronophagia and equivocal intranuclear inclusion bodies. Pseudorabies virus was isolated from fresh tissues from 2 of the dogs, and immunohistochemistry detected the virus in the third dog. Virus sequencing and phylogeny, based upon available GenBank sequences, revealed that the virus was likely a field strain that was closely related to a cluster of PRV strains previously identified in Illinois. Though eradicated from domestic swine in the United States, PRV is present in populations of feral swine, and should therefore continue to be considered a possible cause of disease in dogs and other domestic animals with compatible clinical history and signs. Continued surveillance is necessary to prevent reintroduction of PRV into domestic swine. </jats:p>",0

Two Loci Controlling Genetic Cellular Resistance to Avian Leukosis-Sarcoma Viruses,"<jats:p>Female chickens known to be heterozygous for resistance to subgroups A and B of the avian leukosis-sarcoma viruses were mated to males known to be homozygously resistant to both. The progeny were assayed both on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in tissue culture for resistance to representative viruses of the A, B, and tentatively defined C subgroups. Segregation ratios of resistance to A and B subgroup viruses agreed with the previously suggested hypothesis of single-autosomal-recessive genes controlling resistance to each subgroup. Mixed infection on the CAM and replicate plate infection in tissue culture with subgroup A and B viruses showed that resistance to the A and B subgroups was inherited independently. Assays with viruses tentatively classified as subgroup C indicated that they were largely composed of a mixture of subgroup A and B viruses or of particles possessing the host range specificity of both. However, virus stocks of the subgroup C category, as well as some stocks classified as subgroup B, produced small numbers of pocks or foci on individuals known to be resistant to subgroup A and B viruses. It is suggested that these Rous sarcoma virus stocks carry between 1 and 10% of a true subgroup C virus.</jats:p>",0
Phylogenetic analysis and pathogenicity of H3 subtype avian influenza viruses isolated from live poultry markets in China,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>H3 subtype influenza A virus is one of the main subtypes that threats both public and animal health. However, the evolution and pathogenicity of H3 avian influenza virus (AIV) circulating in domestic birds in China remain largely unclear. In this study, seven H3 AIVs (four H3N2 and three H3N8) were isolated from poultry in live poultry market (LPM) in China. Phylogenetic analyses of full genomes showed that all viruses were clustered into Eurasian lineage, except N8 genes of two H3N8 isolates fell into North American lineage. Intriguingly, the N8 gene of one H3N8 and PB2, PB1, NP and NS of two H3N2 isolates have close relationship with those of the highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses circulating in Korea and United States, suggesting that the H3-like AIV may contribute internal genes to the highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses. Phylogenetic tree of HA gene and antigenic cross-reactivity results indicated that two antigenically different H3 viruses are circulating in LPM in China. Most of the H3 viruses replicated in mice lung and nasal turbinate without prior adaptation and the representative H3 viruses infected chickens without causing clinical signs. The reassortment of H3 subtype influenza viruses warrants continuous surveillance in LPM in China.</jats:p>",0

Clusters were more likely to occur in urban areas and during biannual rainy seasons. Within detected clusters, we identified an unrecognized outbreak of measles-associated SARI; sequence analysis implicated cocirculation of endemic genotype B3 and genotype D4 likely imported from England. We also detected a likely nosocomial SARI cluster associated with a novel picobirnavirus most closely related to swine and dromedary viruses.</jats:p>

One Health—One Medicine: unifying human and animal medicine within an evolutionary paradigm,"<jats:p>One health is a concept since early civilization, which promoted the view that there was no major distinction between animal and human medicine. Although persisting through the 19th century, this common vision was then all but forgotten in the early 20th century. It is now experiencing a renaissance, coincident with an awakening of the role that evolutionary biology plays in human and animal health, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A number of STIs in humans have comparable infections in animals; likewise, both humans and animals have STIs unique to each mammalian camp. These similarities and differences offer opportunities for basic medical and public health studies, including evolutionary insights that can be gleaned from ongoing interdisciplinary investigation—especially with the molecular analytical tools available—in what can become a golden age of mutually helpful discovery.</jats:p>",0

Characterisation of Hungarian porcine circovirus 2 genomes associated with PMWS and PDNS cases,"<jats:p>The authors report the data of the first survey on the incidence of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) in Hungary. A PCR method specific for the detection of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) was developed, which proved to be suitable for diagnostic purposes. PCR screening of organ samples from pigs suspected to be affected with PMWS or PDNS revealed the presence of PCV-2 in 80% of the cases. Six PCV-2 genomes from Hungarian isolates were completely sequenced. Phylogenetic comparison with all the available PCV-2 sequences showed that porcine circoviruses circulating in Hungary are more variable than in several other European countries. Two Hungarian strains clustered together with the Spanish strains forming a distinct group; two others fell in a common group with the French, UK, and Dutch strains, whereas another two strains showed the closest relationship to two of the three known German PCV-2 sequences.</jats:p>",0

Development and validation of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay for rapid detection of parapoxviruses,"<jats:p> Parapoxviruses (PaPVs) cause widespread infections in ruminants worldwide. All PaPVs are zoonotic and may infect humans after direct or indirect contact with infected animals. Herein we report the development and validation of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay for rapid detection of PaPVs. The new assay (referred to as the RVSS assay) was specific for PaPVs only and had no cross-reactivity against other pox viruses. Using a recombinant plasmid as positive control, the analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined to be 16 genome copies of PaPV per assay. The amplification efficiency estimate (91–99%), the intra- and interassay variability estimate (standard deviation [SD]: 0.28–1.06 and 0.01–0.14, respectively), and the operator variability estimate (SD: 0.78 between laboratories and 0.28 between operators within a laboratory) were within the acceptable range. The diagnostic specificity was assessed on 100 specimens from healthy normal animals and all but 1 tested negative (99%). The diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) was assessed on 77 clinical specimens (skin/scab) from infected sheep, goats, and cattle, and all tested positive (100%). The assay was multiplexed with beta-actin as an internal positive control, and the multiplex assay exhibited the same DSe as the singleplex assay. Further characterization of the PaPV specimens by species-specific real-time PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products following conventional PCR showed the presence of Orf virus not only in sheep and goats but also in 1 bovid. The validated RVSS assay demonstrated high specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and ruggedness, which are critical for laboratory detection of PaPVs. </jats:p>",0

How many papillomavirus species can go undetected in papilloma lesions?,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A co-infection comprising to at least seven papillomavirus (PV) types was detected by next generation sequencing (NGS) of randomly primed rolling circle amplification (RCA) products of a bovine (<jats:italic>Bos taurus</jats:italic>) papilloma lesion from the Brazilian Amazon region. Six putative new PV types that could not be detected by commonly used PCR protocols were identified. Their overall L1 nucleotide identities were less than 90% compared to described PV species and types. L1 nucleotide BLAST sequence hits showed that each new type was related to <jats:italic>Beta, Gamma</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Dyokappa</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Dyoeta</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Xipapillomavirus</jats:italic>, as well as two likely new unclassified genera. Our results show that the employment of NGS is relevant to the detection and characterization of distantly related PV and is of major importance in co-infection studies. This knowledge will help us understand the biology and pathogenesis of PV, as well as contribute to disease control. Moreover, we can also conclude that there are many unknown circulating PVs.</jats:p>",0

DNA sequence of frog adenovirus,"<jats:p>The genome of frog adenovirus (FrAdV-1) was sequenced and found to be the smallest of all known adenovirus genomes. The sequence obtained was 26163 bp in size and contains a substantial direct repeat near the right terminus, implying that it was derived by recombination from a parental genome of only 25517 bp. The closest relative of FrAdV-1 proved to be turkey adenovirus 3, an avian adenovirus with no previously known near relative. Sequence comparisons showed that the two viruses have equivalent gene complements, including one gene the product of which is related to sialidases. Phylogenetic analyses supported the establishment of a fourth adenovirus genus containing these two viruses, in addition to the established genera <jats:italic>Mastadenovirus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Aviadenovirus</jats:italic> and the proposed genus <jats:italic>Atadenovirus</jats:italic>.

High global diversity of cycloviruses amongst dragonflies,"<jats:p>Members of the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, specifically the genus <jats:italic>Circovirus</jats:italic>, were thought to infect only vertebrates; however, members of a sister group under the same family, the proposed genus <jats:italic>Cyclovirus</jats:italic>, have been detected recently in insects. In an effort to explore the diversity of cycloviruses and better understand the evolution of these novel ssDNA viruses, here we present five cycloviruses isolated from three dragonfly species (<jats:italic>Orthetrum sabina</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Xanthocnemis zealandica</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Rhionaeschna multicolor</jats:italic>) collected in Australia, New Zealand and the USA, respectively. The genomes of these five viruses share similar genome structure to other cycloviruses, with a circular ~1.7 kb genome and two major bidirectionally transcribed ORFs. The genomic sequence data gathered during this study were combined with all cyclovirus genomes available in public databases to identify conserved motifs and regulatory elements in the intergenic regions, as well as determine diversity and recombinant regions within their genomes. The genomes reported here represent four different cyclovirus species, three of which are novel. Our results confirm that cycloviruses circulate widely in winged-insect populations; in eight different cyclovirus species identified in dragonflies to date, some of these exhibit a broad geographical distribution. Recombination analysis revealed both intra- and inter-species recombination events amongst cycloviruses, including genomes recovered from disparate sources (e.g. goat meat and human faeces). Similar to other well-characterized circular ssDNA viruses, recombination may play an important role in cyclovirus evolution.</jats:p>",0

Bovine papular stomatitis affecting dairy cows and milkers in midwestern Brazil,"<jats:p> Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) is a parapoxvirus associated with papular and erosive lesions on the muzzle, lips, and oral mucosa of cattle. Teats of milking cows are occasionally affected, and the infection is frequently transmitted to human beings. The present report describes an outbreak of BPSV infection affecting cows in midwestern Brazil, with human involvement. The disease was observed in neighboring small hand-milking farms, affecting 20 milking cows. The signs included painful reddish papules, ulcers, and scabby proliferative lesions on the teats, with a clinical course of 7–12 days. Affected cows presented severe local pain, not allowing the completion of milking. Histologically, acanthosis, spongiosis, and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis with adjacent focally extensive ulcers and multifocal inflammatory infiltrate were observed in the epidermis. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies were noted in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Personnel milking the affected cows developed lesions on the hands, painful papules that progressed to ulcerative and scabby lesions in 4–7 days. A polymerase chain reaction using a set of pan-parapoxvirus primers for the B2L gene performed on DNA extracted from scabs amplified a 590-bp product, which when sequenced, revealed similarities of 99%, 85%, and 84% with BPSV, Pseudocowpox virus, and Orf virus, respectively. A phylogenetic tree based on the B2L sequence was constructed, showing that the virus clustered with BPSV isolates. Although clinical cases compatible with BSPV infection have been frequently described in Brazil, the present report identifies the agent associated with cattle and human disease in the country. </jats:p>",0

Novel Parvoviruses from Wild and Domestic Animals in Brazil Provide New Insights into Parvovirus Distribution and Diversity,"<jats:p>Parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) are small, single-stranded DNA viruses. Many parvoviral pathogens of medical, veterinary and ecological importance have been identified. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate the diversity of parvoviruses infecting wild and domestic animals in Brazil. We identified 21 parvovirus sequences (including twelve nearly complete genomes and nine partial genomes) in samples derived from rodents, bats, opossums, birds and cattle in Pernambuco, São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul states. These sequences were investigated using phylogenetic and distance-based approaches and were thereby classified into eight parvovirus species (six of which have not been described previously), representing six distinct genera in the subfamily Parvovirinae. Our findings extend the known biogeographic range of previously characterized parvovirus species and the known host range of three parvovirus genera (Dependovirus, Aveparvovirus and Tetraparvovirus). Moreover, our investigation provides a window into the ecological dynamics of parvovirus infections in vertebrates, revealing that many parvovirus genera contain well-defined sub-lineages that circulate widely throughout the world within particular taxonomic groups of hosts.</jats:p>",0

Monitoring the immune response to vaccination with an inactivated vaccine associated to bovine neonatal pancytopenia by deep sequencing transcriptome analysis in cattle,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) is a new fatal, alloimmune/alloantibody mediated disease of new-born calves induced by ingestion of colostrum from cows, which had been vaccinated with a specific vaccine against the Bovine Virus Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV). The hypothesis of pathogenic MHC class I molecules in the vaccine had been put up, but no formal proof of specific causal MHC class I alleles has been provided yet. However, the unique features of the vaccine obviously result in extremely high specific antibody titres in the vaccinated animals, but apparently also in further molecules inducing BNP. Thus, a comprehensive picture of the immune response to the vaccine is essential. Applying the novel approach of next generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq), our study provides a new holistic, comprehensive analysis of the blood transcriptome regulation after vaccination with the specific BVDV vaccine. Our RNAseq approach identified a novel cytokine-like gene in the bovine genome that is highly upregulated after vaccination. This gene has never been described before in any other species and might be specific to ruminant immune response. Furthermore, our data revealed a very coordinated immune response to double-stranded (ds) RNA or a dsRNA analogue after vaccination with the inactivated single-stranded (ss) RNA vaccine. This would suggest either a substantial contamination of the vaccine with dsRNA from host cells after virus culture or a dsRNA analogue applied to the vaccine. The first option would highlight the potential risks associated with virus culture on homologous cells during vaccine production; the latter option would emphasise the potential risks associated with immune stimulating adjuvants used in vaccine production.</jats:p>",0

Deep Sequencing of Distinct Preparations of the Live Attenuated Varicella-Zoster Virus Vaccine Reveals a Conserved Core of Attenuating Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The continued success of the live attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine in preventing varicella-zoster and herpes zoster is well documented, as are many of the mutations that contribute to the attenuation of the vOka virus for replication in skin. At least three different preparations of vOka are marketed. Here, we show using deep sequencing of seven batches of vOka vaccine (including ZostaVax, VariVax, VarilRix, and the Oka/Biken working seed) from three different manufacturers (VariVax, GSK, and Biken) that 137 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations are present in all vaccine batches. This includes six sites at which the vaccine allele is fixed or near fixation, which we speculate are likely to be important for attenuation. We also show that despite differences in the vaccine populations between preparations, batch-to-batch variation is minimal, as is the number and frequency of mutations unique to individual batches. This suggests that the vaccine manufacturing processes are not introducing new mutations and that, notwithstanding the mixture of variants present, VZV live vaccines are extremely stable.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            The continued success of vaccinations to prevent chickenpox and shingles, combined with the extremely low incidence of adverse reactions, indicates the quality of these vaccines. The vaccine itself is comprised of a heterogeneous live attenuated virus population and thus requires deep-sequencing technologies to explore the differences and similarities in the virus populations between different preparations and batches of the vaccines. Our data demonstrate minimal variation between batches, an important safety feature, and provide new insights into the extent of the mutations present in this attenuated virus.

Enrichment of Viral Nucleic Acids by Solution Hybrid Selection with Genus Specific Oligonucleotides,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Despite recent advances, our knowledge of potential and rare human pathogens is far from exhaustive. Current molecular diagnostic tools mainly rely on the specific amplification of marker sequences and may overlook infections caused by unknown and rare pathogens. Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) can solve this problem; but, due to the extremely low fraction of pathogen genetic material in clinical samples, its application is only cost-effective in special, rather than routine, cases. In this study, we present a method for the semi-specific enrichment of viral conservative sequences in a HTS library by hybridization in solution with genus-specific degenerate biotinylated oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids of the test viruses (yellow fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus) were enriched by solution hybrid selection using pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides. Moreover, enterovirus (family: <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>, genus: <jats:italic>Enterovirus</jats:italic>) sequences were successfully enriched using foot-and-mouth disease virus (family: <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>, genus: <jats:italic>Aphthovirus</jats:italic>) oligonucleotide. The enrichment factor relative to the background nucleic acid was about 1,000-fold. As hybridization has less stringent oligonucleotide match requirements than PCR, few oligonucleotides are sufficient to cover the potential sequence variation in the whole genus and may even enrich nucleic acids of viruses of other related genera. Efficient enrichment of viral sequences makes its use in diagnostics cost-efficient.</jats:p>",0
Megaphages infect Prevotella and variants are widespread in gut microbiomes,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Bacteriophages (phages) dramatically shape microbial community composition, redistribute nutrients via host lysis and drive evolution through horizontal gene transfer. Despite their importance, much remains to be learned about phages in the human microbiome. We investigated the gut microbiomes of humans from Bangladesh and Tanzania, two African baboon social groups and Danish pigs; many of these microbiomes contain phages belonging to a clade with genomes &gt;540 kilobases in length, the largest yet reported in the human microbiome and close to the maximum size ever reported for phages. We refer to these as Lak phages. CRISPR spacer targeting indicates that Lak phages infect bacteria of the genus <jats:italic>Prevotella</jats:italic>. We manually curated to completion 15 distinct Lak phage genomes recovered from metagenomes. The genomes display several interesting features, including use of an alternative genetic code, large intergenic regions that are highly expressed and up to 35 putative transfer RNAs, some of which contain enigmatic introns. Different individuals have distinct phage genotypes, and shifts in variant frequencies over consecutive sampling days reflect changes in the relative abundance of phage subpopulations. Recent homologous recombination has resulted in extensive genome admixture of nine baboon Lak phage populations. We infer that Lak phages are widespread in gut communities that contain the <jats:italic>Prevotella</jats:italic> species, and conclude that megaphages, with fascinating and underexplored biology, may be common but largely overlooked components of human and animal gut microbiomes.</jats:p>",0
Molecular and Antigenic Characterization of Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) from Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss),"<jats:p>Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV-1) causes heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Recently, a novel PRV (formerly PRV-Om, here called PRV-3), was found in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with HSMI-like disease. PRV is considered to be an emerging pathogen in farmed salmonids. In this study, molecular and antigenic characterization of PRV-3 was performed. Erythrocytes are the main target cells for PRV, and blood samples that were collected from experimentally challenged fish were used as source of virus. Virus particles were purified by gradient ultracentrifugation and the complete coding sequences of PRV-3 were obtained by Illumina sequencing. When compared to PRV-1, the nucleotide identity of the coding regions was 80.1%, and the amino acid identities of the predicted PRV-3 proteins varied from 96.7% (λ1) to 79.1% (σ3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PRV-3 belongs to a separate cluster. The region encoding σ3 were sequenced from PRV-3 isolates collected from rainbow trout in Europe. These sequences clustered together, but were distant from PRV-3 that was isolated from rainbow trout in Norway. Bioinformatic analyses of PRV-3 proteins revealed that predicted secondary structures and functional domains were conserved between PRV-3 and PRV-1. Rabbit antisera raised against purified virus or various recombinant virus proteins from PRV-1 all cross-reacted with PRV-3. Our findings indicate that despite different species preferences of the PRV subtypes, several genetic, antigenic, and structural properties are conserved between PRV-1 and-3.</jats:p>",0

Temperate coliphages: classification and correlation with habitats,"<jats:p>Temperate coliphages were recovered from sewage, mammalian feces, and lysogenic strains of Escherichia coli. A total of 32 phages of independent origin were divided into six groups by applying the criteria of host range, antigenic homology, and the ultraviolet inducibility of the prophage. The demonstration of genetic interactions in some cases has confirmed the classification scheme. Nine phages were assigned to the P2 family and 19 to the lambda family. The remaining four isolates may represent some novel phylogenetic types. Phages recovered from the lysogenic strains of E. coli were all found to be P2 related, whereas a majority of the phages recovered as cell-free plaque-forming units were assignable to the lambda family. It is proposed that the biological attributes of the phages belonging to the two principal families are reflected in the distribution patterns observed. The virions of phage HK256 show multiple tail fibers and may thus represent a ""new"" virion form among the temperate coliphages.</jats:p>",0

Molecular Characteristics of the Nipah Virus Glycoproteins,"<jats:p><jats:bold><jats:sc>Abstract: </jats:sc></jats:bold>  <jats:bold>Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus, which emerged in 1998 from fruit bats in Malaysia and caused an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in pigs and fatal encephalitis in humans with high mortality rates. In contrast to most paramyxoviruses, NiV can infect a large variety of mammalian species. Due to this broad host range, its zoonotic potential, its high pathogenicity for humans, and the lack of effective vaccines or therapeutics, NiV was classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen. This article provides an overview of the molecular characteristics of NiV focusing on the structure, functions, and unique biological properties of the two NiV surface glycoproteins, the receptor‐binding G protein, and the fusion protein F. Since viral glycoproteins are major determinants for cell tropism and virus spread, a detailed knowledge of these proteins can help to understand the molecular basis of viral pathogenicity.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",0

"Zoonotic Hepatitis E Virus: Classiﬁcation, Animal Reservoirs and Transmission Routes","<jats:p>During the past ten years, several new hepatitis E viruses (HEVs) have been identiﬁed in various animal species. In parallel, the number of reports of autochthonous hepatitis E in Western countries has increased as well, raising the question of what role these possible animal reservoirs play in human infections. The aim of this review is to present the recent discoveries of animal HEVs and their classiﬁcation within the Hepeviridae family, their zoonotic and species barrier crossing potential, and possible use as models to study hepatitis E pathogenesis. Lastly, this review describes the transmission pathways identiﬁed from animal sources.</jats:p>",0
Sequence analysis of a porcine enterovirus serotype 1 isolate: relationships with other picornaviruses,<jats:p>The majority of the genomic sequence of a porcine enterovirus serotype 1 (PEV-1) isolate was determined. The genome was found to contain a large open reading frame which encoded a leader protein prior to the capsid protein region. This showed no sequence identity to other picornavirus leader regions and the sequence data suggested that it does not possess proteolytic activity. The 2A protease was small and showed considerable sequence identity to the aphthoviruses and to equine rhinovirus serotype 2. The 2A/2B junction possessed the typical cleavage site (NPG/P) exhibited by these viruses. The other proteins shared less than 40% sequence identity with equivalent proteins from other picornavirus genera. Phylogenetic analyses of the P1 and 3D sequences indicated that this virus forms a distinct branch of the family <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>. On the basis of results presented in this paper PEV-1 has been assigned to a new picornavirus genus. The phylogeny of the virus in relation to other picornaviruses is discussed.</jats:p>,0
Functional characterization of a monoclonal antibody epitope using a lambda phage display-deep sequencing platform,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We have recently described a method, named PROFILER, for the identification of antigenic regions preferentially targeted by polyclonal antibody responses after vaccination. To test the ability of the technique to provide insights into the functional properties of monoclonal antibody (mAb) epitopes, we used here a well-characterized epitope of meningococcal factor H binding protein (fHbp), which is recognized by mAb 12C1. An fHbp library, engineered on a lambda phage vector enabling surface expression of polypeptides of widely different length, was subjected to massive parallel sequencing of the phage inserts after affinity selection with the 12C1 mAb. We detected dozens of unique antibody-selected sequences, the most enriched of which (designated as FrC) could largely recapitulate the ability of fHbp to bind mAb 12C1. Computational analysis of the cumulative enrichment of single amino acids in the antibody-selected fragments identified two overrepresented stretches of residues (H248-K254 and S140-G154), whose presence was subsequently found to be required for binding of FrC to mAb 12C1. Collectively, these results suggest that the PROFILER technology can rapidly and reliably identify, in the context of complex conformational epitopes, discrete “hot spots” with a crucial role in antigen-antibody interactions, thereby providing useful clues for the functional characterization of the epitope.</jats:p>",0

Bats Worldwide Carry Hepatitis E Virus-Related Viruses That Form a Putative Novel Genus within the Family Hepeviridae,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis in tropical and temperate climates. Tropical genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with food-borne and waterborne transmission. Zoonotic reservoirs (mainly pigs, wild boar, and deer) are considered for genotypes 3 and 4, which exist in temperate climates. In view of the association of several zoonotic viruses with bats, we analyzed 3,869 bat specimens from 85 different species and from five continents for hepevirus RNA. HEVs were detected in African, Central American, and European bats, forming a novel phylogenetic clade in the family<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepeviridae</jats:named-content>. Bat hepeviruses were highly diversified and comparable to human HEV in sequence variation. No evidence for the transmission of bat hepeviruses to humans was found in over 90,000 human blood donations and individual patient sera. Full-genome analysis of one representative virus confirmed formal classification within the family<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepeviridae</jats:named-content>. Sequence- and distance-based taxonomic evaluations suggested that bat hepeviruses constitute a distinct genus within the family<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepeviridae</jats:named-content>and that at least three other genera comprising human, rodent, and avian hepeviruses can be designated. This may imply that hepeviruses invaded mammalian hosts nonrecently and underwent speciation according to their host restrictions. Human HEV-related viruses in farmed and peridomestic animals might represent secondary acquisitions of human viruses, rather than animal precursors causally involved in the evolution of human HEV.</jats:p>",0

Distribution and characteristics of rodent picornaviruses in China,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Rodents are important reservoir hosts of many important zoonotic viruses. The family Picornaviridae contains clinically important pathogens that infect humans and animals, and increasing numbers of rodent picornaviruses have recently been associated with zoonoses. We collected 574 pharyngeal and anal swab specimens from 287 rodents of 10 different species from eight representative regions of China from October 2013 to July 2015. Seven representative sequences identified from six rodent species were amplified as full genomes and classified into four lineages. Three lineage 1 viruses belonged to a novel genus of picornaviruses and was more closely related to Hepatovirus than to others genera of picornaviruses based on aa homology. Lineage 2, lineage 3, and lineage 4 viruses belonged to the genera Rosavirus, Hunnivirus, and Enterovirus, respectively, representing new species. According to both phylogenetic and identity analyses, Lineage 2 viruses had a close relationship with rosavirus 2 which was recovered from the feces of a child in Gambia and Lineage 3 viruses had a close relationship with domestic animal Hunnivirus. Lineage 4 viruses provide the first evidence of these enteroviruses and their evolution in rodent hosts in China.</jats:p>",0
Molecular Evolution and Emergence of H5N6 Avian Influenza Virus in Central China,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>H5N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) has posed a potential threat to public health since its emergence in China in 2013. To understand the evolution and emergence of H5N6 AIV in the avian population, we performed molecular surveillance of live poultry markets (LPMs) in Wugang Prefecture, Hunan Province, in central China, during 2014 and 2015. Wugang Prefecture is located on the Eastern Asian-Australian migratory bird flyway, and a human death due to an H5N6 virus was reported in the prefecture on 21 November 2016. In total, we sampled and sequenced the complete genomes of 175 H5N6 AIVs. Notably, our analysis revealed that H5N6 AIVs contain at least six genotypes arising from segment reassortment, including a rare variant that possesses an HA gene derived from H5N1 clade 2.3.2 and a novel NP gene that has its origins with H7N3 viruses. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that genetically similar H5N6 AIVs tend to cluster according to their geographic regions of origin. These results help to reveal the evolutionary behavior of influenza viruses prior to their emergence in humans.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            The newly emerged H5N6 influenza A virus has caused more than 10 human deaths in China since 2013. In November 2016, a human death due to an H5N6 virus, in Wugang Prefecture, Hunan Province, was confirmed by the WHO. To better understand the evolution and emergence of H5N6 viruses, we surveyed live poultry markets (LPMs) in Wugang Prefecture before the reported human death, with a focus on revealing the diversity and genomic origins of H5N6 in birds during 2014 and 2015. In general, H5N6 viruses in this region were most closely related to H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4, with the exception of one virus with an HA gene derived from clade 2.3.2 such that it represents a novel reassortant. Clearly, the ongoing surveillance of LPMs is central to monitoring the emergence of pathogenic influenza viruses.

Characterization of a new genotype and serotype of infectious bronchitis virus in Western Africa,"<jats:p>Between 2002 and 2007, more than 1000 chickens from commercial farms, live bird markets and backyard farms in Nigeria and Niger were tested for the presence of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genome. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences of the spike 1 (<jats:italic>S1</jats:italic>) gene revealed a new genotype of IBV that we refer to as ‘IBADAN’. The minimum genetic distance to the closest ‘non-IBADAN’ strains (UK/7/93 at the nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at the amino acid level) reached 24 and 32 % at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The full genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic distance of 9.7–16.4 % at the nucleotide level with all available fully sequenced strains. As IBV S1 plays a major role in antigenicity, the antigenic relatedness of NGA/A116E7/2006 was compared with strains of other serotypes. NGA/A116E7/2006 did not cross-react with antisera against IT02, M41, D274, Connecticut or 793/B strains in virus neutralization assays. NGA/A116E7/2006 cross-reacted with the QX-like strain ITA/90254/2005 but only to a low level (antigenic relatedness of 33 %), suggesting that IBADAN also represents a new serotype. A comparison of <jats:italic>S1</jats:italic> sequences identified several amino acids that may play a role in IBV antigenicity. Despite the absence of obvious clinical signs in poultry infected by IBADAN strains, it is important to test the cross-protection of current vaccine strains.</jats:p>",0

Molecular and microscopic evidence of viruses in marine copepods,"<jats:p>
            As dominant members of marine mesozooplankton communities, copepods play critical roles in oceanic food webs and biogeochemical cycling. Despite the ecological significance of copepods, little is known regarding the causes of copepod mortality, and up to 35% of total copepod mortality cannot be accounted for by predation alone. Viruses have been established as ecologically important infectious agents in the oceans; however, viral infection has not been investigated in mesozooplankton communities. Here we used molecular and microscopic techniques to document viral infection in natural populations of the calanoid copepods
            <jats:italic>Acartia tonsa</jats:italic>
            (Dana) and
            <jats:italic>Labidocera aestiva</jats:italic>

            copepod circo-like virus (AtCopCV) and
            <jats:italic>Labidocera aestiva</jats:italic>
            copepod circo-like virus (LaCopCV). LaCopCV was found to be extremely prevalent and abundant in
            <jats:italic>L. aestiva</jats:italic>
            populations, with up to 100% prevalence in some samples and average viral loads of 1.13 × 10
            <jats:sup>5</jats:sup>
            copies per individual. LaCopCV transcription was also detected in the majority of
            <jats:italic>L. aestiva</jats:italic>
            individuals, indicating viral activity. AtCopCV was sporadically detected in
            <jats:italic>A. tonsa</jats:italic>
            populations year-round, suggesting temporal variability in viral infection dynamics. Finally, virus-like particles of unknown identity were observed in the connective tissues of
            <jats:italic>A. tonsa</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>L. aestiva</jats:italic>
            by transmission electron microscopy, demonstrating that viruses were actively proliferating in copepod connective tissue as opposed to infecting gut contents, parasites, or symbionts. Taken together, these results provide strong independent lines of evidence for active viral infection in dominant copepod species, indicating that viruses may significantly influence mesozooplankton ecology.

            <jats:italic>Platycercus elegans</jats:italic>
            , to our knowledge we find viral phylogenetic structure analogous to Mayr’s ring-species hypothesis for the first time in any pathogen. Across 8 y, the host’s viral prevalence and infection load was lower in hybrid birds and in phenotypically intermediate subspecies. Viral genetic variation did not explain host prevalence or infection load, supporting conclusions that the evolved host response is more important. We show how host–species complexes and viral genomic analyses can provide insight into maintenance of biodiversity.

The Ovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus F Gene Sequence and its Diagnostic Application,"<jats:p> Ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) are classified into 2 subgroups, ovine RSV and bovine RSV. Although ovine RSV infects cattle, its contribution to bovine respiratory tract disease has not been established, which is an important issue for vaccine development in cattle. Diagnosis by virus isolation or serology has low or variable sensitivity and/or specificity and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been recommended as a rapid and sensitive technique for RSV detection. A simple procedure has been developed to detect and identify bovine and ovine RSVs. First, the nucleotide sequence of the ovine RSV fusion (F) gene was determined and compared with representative strains of bovine RSV and human RSV subgroups A and B. The ovine RSV F gene has 85 and 72–73% nucleotide identity with those of bovine RSV and human RSV, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of the ovine RSV F gene has 94 and 83–84% amino acid identity with those of bovine RSV and human RSV, respectively. Then PCR primers targeting a specific F gene fragment of bovine and ovine RSV were designed. The primers represented bases 85–103 and the complementary sequence to bases 510–493 of the ovine RSV F gene. A similar PCR product (426 bp) was obtained on agarose gel electrophoresis from bovine RSV and from ovine RSV. The products, however, were unique to the parent virus and could be distinguished by EcoRI or MspI restriction endonuclease cleavage. EcoRI cleaved the ovine product into 2 bands (285 and 141 bp) but failed to affect the bovine RSV PCR product. However, MspI cleaved the bovine product into 2 bands (229 and 197 bp) but had no effect on the ovine product. Also, this assay did not amplify any PCR product with human RSV. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digestion is a useful and practical approach for detection and differentiation of ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses. </jats:p>",0

Impact of antigenic and genetic drift on the serologic surveillance of H5N2 avian influenza viruses,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Serologic surveillance of Avian Influenza (AI) viruses is carried out by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test using reference reagents. This method is recommended by animal health organizations as a standard test to detect antigenic differences (subtypes) between circulating influenza virus, vaccine- and/or reference- strains. However, significant discrepancies between reference antisera and field isolates have been observed during serosurveillance of influenza A viruses in pig and poultry farms. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of influenza virus genetic and antigenic drift on serologic testing using standard HI assays and reference reagents. Low pathogenic AI H5N2 viruses isolated in Mexico between 1994 and 2008 were used for phylogenetic analysis of AI hemagglutinin genes and for serologic testing using antisera produced with year-specific AI virus isolates.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant divergence between early LPAI H5N2 viruses (1994 - 1998) and more recent virus field isolates (2002 - 2008). Results of the HI test were markedly influenced by the selection of the AI H5N2 virus (year of isolation) used as reference antigen for the assay. These analyses indicate that LPAI H5N2 viruses in Mexico are constantly undergoing genetic drift and that serosurveillance of AI viruses is significantly influenced by the antigen or antisera used for the HI test.</jats:p>

Tracing the origin and co-phylogeny of the caliciviruses,"<jats:p>Caliciviruses infect a wide range of mammalian hosts and include the genus<jats:italic>Norovirus</jats:italic>, the major cause of food-borne viral gastroenteritis in humans. Using publicly available sequence data and phylogenetic analysis tools, the origins and virus–host co-phylogeny of these viruses were investigated. Here, evidence is presented in support of host switching by caliciviruses, but showing that zoonotic transfer does not appear to have occurred in the history of these viruses. The age or demography of the caliciviruses cannot yet be estimated with any firm degree of support, but further studies of this family, as new dated sequences become available, could provide key information of importance to human health and in understanding the emergence of food-borne disease.</jats:p>",0

"Identification and Characterization of Porcine Kobuvirus Variant Isolated from Suckling Piglet in Gansu Province, China","<jats:p>Kobuviruses comprise three species, the Aichivirus A, Aichivirus B, and Aichivirus C (porcine kobuvirus). Porcine kobuvirus is endemic to pig farms and is not restricted geographically but, rather, is distributed worldwide. The complete genomic sequences of four porcine kobuvirus strains isolated during a diarrhea outbreak in piglets in the Gansu province of China were determined. Two of these strains exhibited variations relative to the traditional strains. The potential 3C/3D cleavage sites of the variant strains were Q/C, which differed from the Q/S in the traditional porcine kobuvirus genome. A  90-nucleotide deletion in the 2B protein and a single nucleotide insertion in the 3′UTR were found in the variant strains. The VP1 regions of all four porcine kobuviruses in our study were highly variable (81%–86%). Ten common amino acid mutations were found specifically at certain positions within the VP1 region. Significant recombination sites were identified using SimPlot scans of whole genome sequences. Porcine kobuviruses were also detected in pig serum, indicating that the virus can escape the gastrointestinal tract and travel to the circulatory system. These findings suggest that mutations and recombination events may have contributed to the high level of genetic diversity of porcine kobuviruses and serve as a driving force in its evolution.</jats:p>",0

"A novel recombinant lineage’s contribution to the outbreak of coxsackievirus A6-associated hand, foot and mouth disease in Shanghai, China, 2012-2013","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Since late 2012, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) has gradually become the predominant pathogen responsible for hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in several provinces of China. A total of 626 patients diagnosed with HFMD in Shanghai, China from January 2012 to September 2013 were enrolled in this study. Of these, 292 CVA6 infected cases were subjected to clinical analyses. Whole-genome sequencing, recombination and phylogenetic analyses were also performed. A recombinant CVA6 monophyletic lineage was found during an outbreak of CVA6-associated HFMDs in Shanghai, China in November 2012 and accounted for 21.9% (64/292) of the CVA6 strains during the study period. Recombination analyses showed that the 2C gene of the novel CVA6 virus was probably derived from a coxsackievirus A4 (CVA4) strain circulating in the population. Clinical observation showed that this recombinant CVA6 virus led to a more generalized rash than did the non-recombinant CVA6 virus. This newly emerged CVA6 lineage was associated with a considerable proportion of HFMD cases from 2012 to 2013 in Shanghai and poses a potential threat to public health.</jats:p>",0
Disease outbreaks caused by steppe-type rabies viruses in China,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>While rabies is a significant public health concern in China, the epidemiology of animal rabies in the north and northwest border provinces remains unknown. From February 2013 to March 2014, seven outbreaks of domestic animal rabies caused by wild carnivores in Xinjiang (XJ) and Inner Mongolia (IM) Autonomous Regions, China were reported and diagnosed in brain samples of infected animals by the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and RT–PCR. Ten field rabies viruses were obtained. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis based on the complete<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>gene (1353 bp) amplified directly from the original brain tissues showed that these ten strains were steppe-type viruses, closely related to strains reported in Russia and Mongolia. None had been identified previously in China. The viruses from XJ and IM clustered separately into two lineages showing their different geographical distribution. This study emphasizes the importance of wildlife surveillance and of cross-departmental cooperation in the control of transboundary rabies transmission.</jats:p>",0

Pathogenesis of Influenza D Virus in Cattle,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Cattle have been proposed as the natural reservoir of a novel member of the virus family
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Orthomyxoviridae</jats:named-content>
            , which has been tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV). Although isolated from sick animals, it is unclear whether IDV causes any clinical disease in cattle. To address this aspect of Koch's postulates, three dairy calves (treatment animals) held in individual pens were inoculated intranasally with IDV strain D/bovine/Mississippi/C00046N/2014. At 1 day postinoculation, a seronegative calf (contact animal) was added to each of the treatment animal pens. The cattle in both treatment and contact groups seroconverted, and virus was detected in their respiratory tracts. Histologically, there was a significant increase in neutrophil tracking in tracheal epithelia of the treatment calves compared to control animals. While infected and contact animals demonstrated various symptoms of respiratory tract infection, they were mild, and the calves in the treatment group did not differ from the controls in terms of heart rate, respiratory rate, or rectal temperature. To mimic zoonotic transmission, two ferrets were exposed to a plastic toy fomite soaked with infected nasal discharge from the treatment calves. These ferrets did not shed the virus or seroconvert. In summary, this study demonstrates that IDV causes a mild respiratory disease upon experimental infection of cattle and can be transmitted effectively among cattle by in-pen contact, but not from cattle to ferrets through fomite exposure. These findings support the hypothesis that cattle are a natural reservoir for the virus.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            A novel influenza virus, tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV), was identified in swine, cattle, sheep, and goats. Among these hosts, cattle have been proposed as the natural reservoir. In this study, we show that cattle experimentally infected with IDV can shed virus and transmit it to other cattle through direct contact, but not to ferrets through fomite routes. IDV caused minor clinical signs in the infected cattle, fulfilling another of Koch's postulates for this novel agent, although other objective clinical endpoints were not different from those of control animals. Although the disease observed was mild, IDV induced neutrophil tracking and epithelial attenuation in cattle trachea, which could facilitate coinfection with other pathogens, and in doing so, predispose animals to bovine respiratory disease.

Forty‐one clinical samples isolated during the poultry fall in Novosibirsk (Russia, 2005) were successfully identified using the proposed technique. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were 76% and 100%, respectively, compared with the ‘gold standard’ techniques (virus isolation with following characterization by immunoassay).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions </jats:bold> We conclude that the method of subtyping using gel‐based microchips is a promising approach for fast detection and identification of influenza A, which may greatly improve its monitoring.</jats:p>",0

Bat Astroviruses: Towards Understanding the Transmission Dynamics of a Neglected Virus Family,"<jats:p>Bats belong to the order Chiroptera that represents the second largest order of mammals with more than 1200 species and an almost global distribution. Environmental changes and deforestation have severely influenced many ecosystems, intensifying the contact between wildlife and humans. In recent years, bats have been found to harbor a number of different viruses with zoonotic potential, as well as a great diversity of astroviruses, for which the question of zoonotic potential remains unanswered to date. Human astroviruses have been identified as the causative agent for diarrhea in children and immunocompromised patients. For a long time, astroviruses have been considered to be strictly species-specific. However, a great genetic diversity has recently been discovered among animal and human astroviruses that might indicate the potential of these viruses to cross species barriers. Furthermore, our knowledge about the tissue tropism of astroviruses has been expanded to some neurotropic strains that have recently been shown to be responsible for encephalitis in humans and livestock. This review gives an overview on what is known about astroviruses in bats, humans and livestock, especially bovines and pigs. Future research activities are suggested to unravel astrovirus infection dynamics in bat populations to further assess the zoonotic potential of these viruses.</jats:p>",0
A mutation ‘hot spot’ in the Schmallenberg virus M segment,"<jats:p>In the autumn of 2011, Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a novel orthobunyavirus of the Simbu serogroup, was identified by metagenomic analysis in Germany. SBV has since been detected in ruminants all over Europe, and investigations on phylogenetic relationships, clinical signs and epidemiology have been conducted. However, until now, only comparative sequence analysis of SBV genome segments with other species of the Simbu serogroup have been performed, and detailed data on the S and M segments, relevant for virus–host-cell interaction, have been missing. In this study, we investigated the S- and M-segment sequences obtained from 24 SBV-positive field samples from sheep, cattle and a goat collected from all over Germany. The results obtained indicated that the overall genome variability of SBV is neither regionally nor host species dependent. Nevertheless, we characterized for the first time a region of high sequence variability (a mutation ‘hot spot’) within the glycoprotein Gc encoded by the M segment.</jats:p>",0

Influenza D in Italy: towards a better understanding of an emerging viral infection in swine,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Influenza D virus (IDV), a new member of the <jats:italic>Orthomyxoviridae</jats:italic> family, was first reported in 2011 in swine in Oklahoma, and consequently found in cattle across North America and Eurasia. To investigate the circulation of IDV among pigs in Italy, in the period between June 2015 and May 2016, biomolecular and virological tests were performed on 845 clinical samples collected from 448 pig farms affected by respiratory distress located in the Po Valley. Serological tests were conducted on 3698 swine sera, including archive sera collected in 2009, as well as samples collected in 2015 from the same region. Viral genome was detected in 21 (2.3%) samples from 9 herds (2%), while virus was successfully isolated from 3 samples. Genetic analysis highlighted that Italian swine IDVs are closely related to the D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 cluster. Sera collected in 2015 showed a high prevalence of IDV antibody titers (11.7%), while archive sera from 2009 showed statistically significant lower positivity rates (0.6%). Our results indicate an increasing epidemiological relevance of the pathogen and the need for in-depth investigations towards understanding its pathogenesis, epidemiology and possible zoonotic potential of this emerging virus.</jats:p>",0

Genetic diversity among pandemic 2009 influenza viruses isolated from a transmission chain,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Influenza viruses such as swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) generate genetic diversity due to the high error rate of their RNA polymerase, often resulting in mixed genotype populations (intra-host variants) within a single infection. This variation helps influenza to rapidly respond to selection pressures, such as those imposed by the immunological host response and antiviral therapy. We have applied deep sequencing to characterize influenza intra-host variation in a transmission chain consisting of three cases due to oseltamivir-sensitive viruses, and one derived oseltamivir-resistant case.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>No evidence for the resistance-causing mutation (resulting in <jats:italic>NA</jats:italic> H275Y substitution) was observed in the oseltamivir-sensitive cases.

          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Oseltamivir-resistance was only detected after prophylaxis with oseltamivir, suggesting that the mutation was selected for as a result of antiviral intervention. The persisting oseltamivir-sensitive virus population in the case carrying resistant viruses suggests either that a small proportion survive the treatment, or that the oseltamivir-sensitive virus rapidly re-establishes itself in the virus population after the bottleneck. Moreover, the increased intra-host variation in the oseltamivir-resistant case is consistent with the hypothesis that the population diversity of a RNA virus can increase rapidly following a population bottleneck.</jats:p>

Discovery of parvovirus-related sequences in an unexpected broad range of animals,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Our knowledge of the genetic diversity and host ranges of viruses is fragmentary. This is particularly true for the <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic> family. Genetic diversity studies of single stranded DNA viruses within this family have been largely focused on arthropod- and vertebrate-infecting species that cause diseases of humans and our domesticated animals: a focus that has biased our perception of parvovirus diversity. While metagenomics approaches could help rectify this bias, so too could transcriptomics studies. Large amounts of transcriptomic data are available for a diverse array of animal species and whenever this data has inadvertently been gathered from virus-infected individuals, it could contain detectable viral transcripts. We therefore performed a systematic search for parvovirus-related sequences (PRSs) within publicly available transcript, genome and protein databases and eleven new transcriptome datasets. This revealed 463 PRSs in the transcript databases of 118 animals. At least 41 of these PRSs are likely integrated within animal genomes in that they were also found within genomic sequence databases. Besides illuminating the ubiquity of parvoviruses, the number of parvoviral sequences discovered within public databases revealed numerous previously unknown parvovirus-host combinations; particularly in invertebrates. Our findings suggest that the host-ranges of extant parvoviruses might span the entire animal kingdom.</jats:p>",0
Classification of Cowpox Viruses into Several Distinct Clades and Identification of a Novel Lineage,"<jats:p>Cowpox virus (CPXV) was considered as uniform species within the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV). Previous phylogenetic analysis indicated that CPXV is polyphyletic and isolates may cluster into different clades with two of these clades showing genetic similarities to either variola (VARV) or vaccinia viruses (VACV). Further analyses were initiated to assess both the genetic diversity and the evolutionary background of circulating CPXVs. Here we report the full-length sequences of 20 CPXV strains isolated from different animal species and humans in Germany. A phylogenetic analysis of altogether 83 full-length OPV genomes confirmed the polyphyletic character of the species CPXV and suggested at least four different clades. The German isolates from this study mainly clustered into two CPXV-like clades, and VARV- and VACV-like strains were not observed. A single strain, isolated from a cotton-top tamarin, clustered distantly from all other CPXVs and might represent a novel and unique evolutionary lineage. The classification of CPXV strains into clades roughly followed their geographic origin, with the highest clade diversity so far observed for Germany. Furthermore, we found evidence for recombination between OPV clades without significant disruption of the observed clustering. In conclusion, this analysis markedly expands the number of available CPXV full-length sequences and confirms the co-circulation of several CPXV clades in Germany, and provides the first data about a new evolutionary CPXV lineage.</jats:p>",0
Exploratory metagenomic analyses of periweaning failure‐to‐thrive syndrome‐affected pigs,"<jats:p>Modern pig farming is characterised by the emergence of several syndromes whose aetiology is unclear or has a multifactorial origin, including periweaning failure‐to‐thrive syndrome (PFTS). In fact, its specific aetiology remains elusive, although several causes have been investigated over time. The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of viral agents in PFTS‐affected and healthy animals by evaluating the virome composition of different organs using a metagenomic approach. This analysis allowed demonstrating a higher abundance of <jats:italic>Porcine parvovirus 6</jats:italic> (PPV6) in healthy subjects while <jats:italic>Ungulate bocaparvovirus 2</jats:italic> (BoPV2), <jats:italic>Ungulate protoparvovirus 1</jats:italic> (PPV) and <jats:italic>Porcine circovirus 3</jats:italic> (PCV‐3) were increased in pigs with PFTS. No differential abundance of RNA viruses was found between PFTS‐affected and control pigs. Remarkably, this is the first molecular characterisation of PPV6 and BoPV2 in Spain and one of the few all around the world, supporting their apparent widespread circulation. Interestingly, PCV‐3 has been recently identified in several clinical‐pathological conditions as well as in healthy pigs, while BoPV2 pathogenic potential is unknown. Although obtained results must be taken as preliminary, they open the door for further studies on the potential role of these viruses or their combination as predisposing factor/s for PFTS occurrence.</jats:p>",0

            that causes symptoms indistinguishable from those of foot-and-mouth disease virus. Phylogenetic studies suggest that it is a recently evolved genetic sublineage of the important human pathogen coxsackievirus B5 (CBV5), and in agreement with this, it has been shown to utilize the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) for cell entry. The 3.0-Å crystal structure of strain UK/27/72 SVDV (highly virulent) reveals the expected similarity in core structure to those of other picornaviruses, showing most similarity to the closest available structure to CBV5, that of coxsackievirus B3 (CBV3). Features that help to cement together and rigidify the protein subunits are extended in this virus, perhaps explaining its extreme tolerance of environmental factors. Using the large number of capsid sequences available for both SVDV and CBV5, we have mapped the amino acid substitutions that may have occurred during the supposed adaptation of SVDV to a new host onto the structure of SVDV and a model of the SVDV/CAR complex generated by reference to the cryo-electron microscopy-visualized complex of CBV3 and CAR. The changes fall into three clusters as follows: one lines the fivefold pore, a second maps to the CAR-binding site and partially overlaps the site for decay accelerating factor (DAF) to bind to echovirus 7 (ECHO7), and the third lies close to the fivefold axis, where the low-density lipoprotein receptor binds to the minor group of rhinoviruses. Later changes in SVDV (post-1971) map to the first two clusters and may, by optimizing recognition of a pig CAR and/or DAF homologue, have improved the adaptation of the virus to pigs.

Unexpected Interfarm Transmission Dynamics during a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Epidemic,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Next-generation sequencing technology is now being increasingly applied to study the within- and between-host population dynamics of viruses. However, information on avian influenza virus evolution and transmission during a naturally occurring epidemic is still limited. Here, we use deep-sequencing data obtained from clinical samples collected from five industrial holdings and a backyard farm infected during the 2013 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 epidemic in Italy to unravel (i) the epidemic virus population diversity, (ii) the evolution of virus pathogenicity, and (iii) the pathways of viral transmission between different holdings and sheds. We show a high level of genetic diversity of the HPAI H7N7 viruses within a single farm as a consequence of separate bottlenecks and founder effects. In particular, we identified the cocirculation in the index case of two viral strains showing a different insertion at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, as well as nine nucleotide differences at the consensus level and 92 minority variants. To assess interfarm transmission, we combined epidemiological and genetic data and identified the index case as the major source of the virus, suggesting the spread of different viral haplotypes from the index farm to the other industrial holdings, probably at different time points. Our results revealed interfarm transmission dynamics that the epidemiological data alone could not unravel and demonstrated that delay in the disease detection and stamping out was the major cause of the emergence and the spread of the HPAI strain.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            The within- and between-host evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain during a naturally occurring epidemic is currently poorly understood. Here, we perform for the first time an in-depth sequence analysis of all the samples collected during a HPAI epidemic and demonstrate the importance to complement outbreak investigations with genetic data to reconstruct the transmission dynamics of the viruses and to evaluate the within- and between-farm genetic diversity of the viral population. We show that the evolutionary transition from the low pathogenic form to the highly pathogenic form occurred within the first infected flock, where we identified haplotypes with hemagglutinin cleavage site of different lengths. We also identify the index case as the major source of virus, indicating that prompt application of depopulation measures is essential to limit virus spread to other farms.

The two mutants in group ChII had RNA-positive phenotypes, and the virions were thermolabile. Mutant ts Ch851 of group ChV was also RNA positive, and the M polypeptide of this mutant appeared to be unstable in cells incubated at restrictive temperature. It is likely, therefore, that complementation groups ChII and ChV represent the genes coding for the two viral proteins of the virion envelope. No precise assignment can be made in the case of the four RNA-negative groups, since all the mutants examined showed some polymerase activity in vitro at restrictive temperature. An attempt to obtain polymerase mutants by screening for sensitivity to rifampin was not successful. Six temperature-dependent host range mutants (the tdCE phenotype) of Chandipura virus failed to multiply in chicken embryo cells at restrictive temperature, but otherwise they differed in their host range properties from similar mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus.</jats:p>",0

"Biological Heterogeneity, Including Systemic Replication in Mice, of H5N1 Influenza A Virus Isolates from Humans in Hong Kong","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            An H5N1 avian influenza A virus was transmitted to humans in Hong Kong in 1997. Although the virus causes systemic infection and is highly lethal in chickens because of the susceptibility of the hemagglutinin to furin and PC6 proteases, it is not known whether it also causes systemic infection in humans. The clinical outcomes of infection in Hong Kong residents ranged widely, from mild respiratory disease to multiple organ failure leading to death. Therefore, to understand the pathogenesis of influenza due to these H5N1 isolates, we investigated their virulence in mice. The results identified two distinct groups of viruses: group 1, for which the dose lethal for 50% of mice (MLD
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            ) was between 0.3 and 11 PFU, and group 2, for which the MLD
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            was more than 10
            <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>
            PFU. One day after intranasal inoculation of mice with 100 PFU of group 1 viruses, the virus titer in lungs was 10
            <jats:sup>7</jats:sup>
            PFU/g or 3 log units higher than that for group 2 viruses. Both types of viruses had replicated to high titers (&gt;10
            <jats:sup>6</jats:sup>
            PFU/g) in the lungs by day 3 and maintained these titers through day 6. More importantly, only the group 1 viruses caused systemic infection, replicating in nonrespiratory organs, including the brain. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the replication of a group 1 virus in brain neurons and glial cells and in cardiac myofibers. Phylogenetic analysis of all viral genes showed that both groups of Hong Kong H5N1 viruses had formed a lineage distinct from those of other viruses and that genetic reassortment between H5N1 and H1 or H3 human viruses had not occurred. Since mice and humans harbor both the furin and the PC6 proteases, we suggest that the virulence mechanism responsible for the lethality of influenza viruses in birds also operates in mammalian hosts. The failure of some H5N1 viruses to produce systemic infection in our model indicates that multiple, still-to-be-identified, factors contribute to the severity of H5N1 infection in mammals. In addition, the ability of these viruses to produce systemic infection in mice and the clear differences in pathogenicity among the isolates studied here indicate that this system provides a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of avian influenza virus infection in mammals.

VINHV is the second nairovirus reported to be isolated on mainland Australia and the first to be sequenced and analysed. Our genetic analysis shows that VINHV belongs to the Dera Ghazi Khan genogroup, a group of viruses previously isolated in other parts of the world including Asia, South Africa, and the USA. We discuss possible routes of entry for nairoviruses into Australia and the need to understand the virome of Australian ticks in the context of new and emerging disease.</jats:p>",0
Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of <i>Bluetongue virus</i> serotype 2 strains isolated in the Americas including a novel strain from the western United States,"<jats:p> Bluetongue is a potentially fatal arboviral disease of domestic and wild ruminants that is characterized by widespread edema and tissue necrosis. Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes 10, 11, 13, and 17 occur throughout much of the United States, whereas serotype 2 (BTV-2) was previously only detected in the southeastern United States. Since 1998, 10 other BTV serotypes have also been isolated from ruminants in the southeastern United States. In 2010, BTV-2 was identified in California for the first time, and preliminary sequence analysis indicated that the virus isolate was closely related to BTV strains circulating in the southeastern United States. In the current study, the whole genome sequence of the California strain of BTV-2 was compared with those of other BTV-2 strains in the Americas. The results of the analysis suggest co-circulation of genetically distinct viruses in the southeastern United States, and further suggest that the 2010 western isolate is closely related to southeastern strains of BTV. Although it remains uncertain as to how this novel virus was translocated to California, the findings of the current study underscore the need for ongoing surveillance of this economically important livestock disease. </jats:p>",0
Antigenic relationships among some animal rotaviruses: virus neutralization in vitro and cross-protection in piglets,"<jats:p>The serotype, RNA electropherotype, and cross-protection properties of rotaviruses isolated from canine, simian, porcine, and human species were compared. The bovine strain B:USA:78:1A and the canine strain C:USA:81:2 were adapted to cell culture and cloned in this study. The other viruses, i.e., simian strain S:USA:79:2, porcine Ohio State University strain P:USA:77:1, and human strain WA, were already cell culture adapted, although they were further cloned for this work. The serum neutralization test was used to classify the viruses into serotype groups. Viruses which exhibited a difference of 20-fold or greater in neutralization titer were separated into different serotype groups. In this study, four major serotype groups were found, and these groups were represented by bovine, human, porcine, and canine-simian strains. From cross-protection studies, these serotype groups were found to be significantly different. With the exception of the porcine strain, none of the viruses used as vaccines protected gnotobiotic piglets from challenge with the virulent porcine Ohio State University strain of rotavirus. Furthermore, the canine virus protected piglets from challenge with the simian virus. The RNA electropherotype confirmed that the canine and simian strains were different in eight RNA segments and eliminated the possibility that they were the same virus. From these findings, it was concluded that only viruses belonging to the same serotype group can be expected to confer cross-protection, and thus, vaccines should be made with the serotypes to which the animal is likely to be exposed.</jats:p>",0

Genetic diversity of novel circular ssDNA viruses in bats in China,"<jats:p>Novel circular ssDNA genomes have recently been detected in animals and in the environment using metagenomic and high-throughput sequencing approaches. In this study, five full-length circular ssDNA genomes were recovered from bat faecal samples using inverse PCR with sequences designed based on circovirus-related sequences obtained from Solexa sequencing data derived from a random amplification method. These five sequences shared a similar genomic organization to circovirus or the recently proposed cyclovirus of the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>. The newly obtained circovirus/cyclovirus-like genomes ranged from 1741 to 2177 bp, and each consisted of two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encoding putative replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively. The potential stem–loop region was predicted in all five genomes, and three of them had the typical conserved nonanucleotide motif of cycloviruses. A set of primers targeting the conserved Rep region was designed and used to detect the prevalence of circovirus/cyclovirus sequences in individual bats. Among 199 samples tested, 47 were positive (23.6 %) for the circovirus genome and two (1.0 %) were positive for the cyclovirus genome. In total, 48 partial Rep sequences plus the five full-length genomes were obtained in this study. Detailed analysis indicated that these sequences are distantly related to known circovirus/cyclovirus genomes and may represent 22 novel species that belong to the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0

Microarray resources for genetic and genomic studies in chicken: A review,"<jats:p>Advent of microarray technologies revolutionized the nature and scope of genetic and genomic research in human and other species by allowing massively parallel analysis of thousands of genomic sites. They have been used for diverse purposes such as for transcriptome analysis, CNV detection, SNP and CNV genotyping, studying DNA‐protein interaction, and detection of genome methylation. Microarrays have also made invaluable contributions to research in chicken which is an important model organism for studying embryology, immunology, oncology, virology, evolution, genetics, and genomics and also for other avian species. Despite their huge contributions in life science research, the future of microarrays is now being questioned with the advent of massively parallel next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which promise to overcome some of the limitations of microarray platforms. In this article we review the various microarray resources developed for chicken and their past and potential future applications. We also discuss about the future of microarrays in the NGS era particularly in the context of livestock genetics. We argue that even though NGS promises some major advantages—in particular, offers the opportunity to discover novel elements in the genome—microarrays will continue to be major tools for research and practice in the field of livestock genetics/genomics due to their affordability, high throughput nature, mature established technologies and ease of application. Moreover, with advent of new microarray technologies like capture arrays, the NGS and microarrays are expected to complement each other in future research in life science. genesis 51:337–356. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",0

Phage therapy in livestock methane amelioration.,"<title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Viruses of prokaryotes (phages) are obligate microbial pathogens that can, in the lytic phase of development, infect and lyse their respective bacterial or archaeal hosts. As such, these viruses can reduce the population density of their hosts rapidly, and have been viewed as possible agents of biological control (phage therapy). Phage therapy is becoming increasingly important as a means of eradicating or controlling microbial populations as the use of antibiotics and chemical treatments becomes both less effective and less publicly acceptable. Phage therapy has therefore been raised as a potential strategy to reduce methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from ruminants, providing an innovative biological approach, harnessing the potent, yet targeted, biocidal attributes of these naturally occurring microbial predators.</p>",0
Whole-Genome Sequencing in Outbreak Analysis,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>In addition to the ever-present concern of medical professionals about epidemics of infectious diseases, the relative ease of access and low cost of obtaining, producing, and disseminating pathogenic organisms or biological toxins mean that bioterrorism activity should also be considered when facing a disease outbreak. Utilization of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in outbreak analysis facilitates the rapid and accurate identification of virulence factors of the pathogen and can be used to identify the path of disease transmission within a population and provide information on the probable source. Molecular tools such as WGS are being refined and advanced at a rapid pace to provide robust and higher-resolution methods for identifying, comparing, and classifying pathogenic organisms. If these methods of pathogen characterization are properly applied, they will enable an improved public health response whether a disease outbreak was initiated by natural events or by accidental or deliberate human activity. The current application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to microbial WGS and microbial forensics is reviewed.</jats:p>",0

"Potential for Co-Infection of a Mosquito-Specific Flavivirus, Nhumirim Virus, to Block West Nile Virus Transmission in Mosquitoes","<jats:p>Nhumirim virus (NHUV) is an insect-specific virus that phylogenetically affiliates with dual-host mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Previous in vitro co-infection experiments demonstrated prior or concurrent infection of Aedes albopictus C6/36 mosquito cells with NHUV resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in viral production of West Nile virus (WNV). This interference between WNV and NHUV was observed herein in an additional Ae. albopictus mosquito cell line, C7-10. A WNV 2K peptide (V9M) mutant capable of superinfection with a pre-established WNV infection demonstrated a comparable level of interference from NHUV as the parental WNV strain in C6/36 and C7-10 cells. Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex pipiens mosquitoes intrathoracically inoculated with NHUVandWNV, or solely withWNVas a control, were allowed to extrinsically incubate the viruses up to nine and 14 days, respectively, and transmissibility and replication of WNV was determined. The proportion of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes capable of transmitting WNV was significantly lower for the WNV/NHUV group than the WNV control at seven and nine days post inoculation (dpi), while no differences were observed in the Cx. pipiens inoculation group. By dpi nine, a 40% reduction in transmissibility in mosquitoes from the dual inoculation group was observed compared to the WNV-only control. These data indicate the potential that infection of some Culex spp. vectors with NHUV could serve as a barrier for efficient transmissibility of flaviviruses associated with human disease.</jats:p>",0

Genetic diversity of bovine viral diarrhea virus in cattle from Mexico,"<jats:p> Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infects cattle populations worldwide, causing significant economic losses though its impact on animal health. Previous studies have reported the prevalence of BVDV species and subgenotypes in cattle from the United States and Canada. We investigated the genetic diversity of BVDV strains detected in bovine serum samples from 6 different Mexican regions. Sixty-two BVDV isolates from Mexico were genetically typed based on comparison of sequences from the 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the viral genome. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that 60 of the samples belonged to the BVDV-1 genotype and 2 to the BVDV-2 genotype. Comparison of partial 5′-UTR sequences clustered 49 samples within BVDV-1c, 8 samples within BVDV-1a, 3 samples within BVDV-1b, and 2 samples clustered with the BVDV-2a subgenotypes. Our study, combined with information previously published on BVDV field strain diversity in the United States and Canada, benefits the development of effective detection assays, vaccines, and control programs for North America. </jats:p>",0

Similarity of the outer capsid protein VP4 of the Gottfried strain of porcine rotavirus to that of asymptomatic human rotavirus strains,"<jats:p>Genomic segment 4 of the porcine Gottfried strain (serotype 4) of porcine rotavirus, which encodes the outer capsid protein VP4, was sequences, and its deduced amino acid sequence was analyzed. Amino acid homology of the porcine rotavirus VP4 to the corresponding protein of asymptomatic or symptomatic human rotaviruses representing serotypes 1 to 4 ranged from 87.1 to 88.1% for asymptomatic strains and from 77.5 to 77.8% for symptomatic strains. Amino acid homology of the Gottfried strain to simian rhesus rotavirus, simian SA11 virus, bovine Nebraska calf diarrhea virus, and porcine OSU strains ranged from 71.5 to 74.3%. Antigenic similarities of VP4 epitopes between the Gottfried strain and human rotaviruses were detected by a plaque reduction neutralization test with hyperimmune antisera produced against the Gottfried strain or a Gottfried (10 genes) x human DS-1 rotavirus (VP7 gene) reassortant which exhibited serotype 2 neutralization specificity. In addition, a panel of six anti-VP4 monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing human rotaviruses belonging to serotype 1, 3, or 4 was able to neutralize the Gottfried strain. These observations suggest that the VP4 outer capsid protein of the Gottfried rotavirus is more closely related to human rotaviruses than to animal rotaviruses.</jats:p>",0

Advances in antiviral vaccine development,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Antiviral vaccines have been the most successful biomedical intervention for preventing epidemic viral disease. Vaccination for smallpox in humans and rinderpest in cattle was the basis for disease eradication, and recent progress in polio eradication is promising. Although early vaccines were developed empirically by passage in live animals or eggs, more recent vaccines have been developed because of the advent of new technologies, particularly cell culture and molecular biology. Recent technological advances in gene delivery and expression, nanoparticles, protein manufacturing, and adjuvants have created the potential for new vaccine platforms that may provide solutions for vaccines against viral pathogens for which no interventions currently exist. In addition, the technological convergence of human monoclonal antibody isolation, structural biology, and high‐throughput sequencing is providing new opportunities for atomic‐level immunogen design. Selection of human monoclonal antibodies can identify immunodominant antigenic sites associated with neutralization and provide reagents for stabilizing and solving the structure of viral surface proteins. Understanding the structural basis for neutralization can guide selection of vaccine targets. Deep sequencing of the antibody repertoire and defining the ontogeny of the desired antibody responses can reveal the junctional recombination and somatic mutation requirements for B‐cell recognition and affinity maturation. Collectively, this information will provide new strategic approaches for selecting vaccine antigens, formulations, and regimens. Moreover, it creates the potential for rational vaccine design and establishing a catalogue of vaccine technology platforms that would be effective against any given family or class of viral pathogens and improve our readiness to address new emerging viral threats.</jats:p>",0

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Macaca nemestrina</jats:named-content>
            (RFHVMn), the pig-tailed macaque homolog of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), was determined by next-generation sequence analysis of a Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-like macaque tumor. Colinearity of genes was observed with the KSHV genome, and the core herpesvirus genes had strong sequence homology to the corresponding KSHV genes. RFHVMn lacked homologs of open reading frame 11 (ORF11) and KSHV ORFs K5 and K6, which appear to have been generated by duplication of ORFs K3 and K4 after the divergence of KSHV and RFHV. RFHVMn contained positional homologs of all other unique KSHV genes, although some showed limited sequence similarity. RFHVMn contained a number of candidate microRNA genes. Although there was little sequence similarity with KSHV microRNAs, one candidate contained the same seed sequence as the positional homolog, kshv-miR-K12-10a, suggesting functional overlap. RNA transcript splicing was highly conserved between RFHVMn and KSHV, and strong sequence conservation was noted in specific promoters and putative origins of replication, predicting important functional similarities. Sequence comparisons indicated that RFHVMn and KSHV developed in long-term synchrony with the evolution of their hosts, and both viruses phylogenetically group within the RV1 lineage of Old World primate rhadinoviruses. RFHVMn is the closest homolog of KSHV to be completely sequenced and the first sequenced RV1 rhadinovirus homolog of KSHV from a nonhuman Old World primate. The strong genetic and sequence similarity between RFHVMn and KSHV, coupled with similarities in biology and pathology, demonstrate that RFHVMn infection in macaques offers an important and relevant model for the study of KSHV in humans.

            <jats:p>Diarrhea kills 2 million children worldwide each year, yet an etiological agent is not found in approximately 30–50% of cases. Picornaviral genera such as enterovirus, kobuvirus, cosavirus, parechovirus, hepatovirus, teschovirus, and cardiovirus have all been found in human and animal diarrhea.

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>A pool of 141 pediatric gastroenteritis samples that were previously found to be negative for known diarrheal viruses was subjected to pyrosequencing. From a total of 937,935 sequence reads, a collection of 849 reads distantly related to Aichi virus were assembled and found to comprise 75% of a novel picornavirus genome. The complete genome was subsequently cloned and found to share 52.3% nucleotide pairwise identity and 38.9% amino acid identity to Aichi virus. The low level of sequence identity suggests a novel picornavirus genus which we have designated klassevirus. Blinded screening of 751 stool specimens from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals revealed a second positive case of klassevirus infection, which was subsequently found to be from the index case's 11-month old twin.</jats:p>

Identification of potyviruses infecting vanilla by direct sequencing of a short RT‐PCR amplicon,"<jats:p>A simple one‐tube one‐step RT‐PCR assay with degenerate primers followed by direct sequencing of a 327 bp coat protein gene fragment was used to identify the potyviruses infecting vanilla. With this technique, unambiguous species allocation was achieved for 34 potyvirus‐infected vanilla samples collected in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific areas between 1997 and 2005.

Newly discovered mosquito viruses help control vector-borne viral diseases,"<jats:p>Many well-known mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, Zika, West Nile, chikungunya and Ross River viruses can be transmitted to vertebrates and are associated with disease in man or animals. However, the use of deep sequencing and other open-minded approaches to detect viruses in mosquitoes have uncovered many new RNA viruses, most of which do not infect vertebrates. The discovery of these ‘insect-specific' viruses (ISVs) has redefined the mosquito virome and prompted the lines of viral taxonomic classification to be redrawn1,2. Despite their benign phenotype, ISVs have become a hot topic of research, with recent studies indicating they have significant application for biotechnology.</jats:p>",0

Genetic Recombination between Two Genotypes of Genogroup III Bovine Noroviruses (BoNVs) and Capsid Sequence Diversity among BoNVs and Nebraska-Like Bovine Enteric Caliciviruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            To determine the genogroups and genotypes of bovine enteric caliciviruses (BECVs) circulating in calves, we determined the complete capsid gene sequences of 21 BECVs. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were compared phylogenetically with those of known human and animal enteric caliciviruses. Based on these analyses, 15 BECVs belonged to
            <jats:italic>Norovirus</jats:italic>
            genogroup III and genotype 2 (GIII/2) and were genetically distinct from human
            <jats:italic>Norovirus</jats:italic>
            GI and GII. Six BECVs had capsid gene sequences similar to that of the unclassified Nebraska (NB)-like BECV. The 15 bovine noroviruses (BoNVs) were more closely related to Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (GIII/2) and other known genotype 2 BoNVs than to genotype 1 Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE. The BoNV Bo/CV521-OH/02/US showed high nucleotide and amino acid identities (84 and 94%, respectively) with the capsid gene of Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK, whereas the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the RNA polymerase gene were more closely related to those of Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE (77 and 87% identities, respectively) than to those of Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (69 and 69% identities, respectively), suggesting that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US is a genotype 1-2 recombinant. Gene conversion analysis by the recombinant identification program and SimPlot also predicted that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US was a recombinant. Six NB-like BECVs shared 88 to 92% nucleotide and 94 to 99.5% amino acid identities with the NB BECV in the capsid gene. The results of this study demonstrate genetic diversity in the capsid genes of BECVs circulating in Ohio veal calves, provide new data for coinfections with distinct BECV genotypes or genogroups, and describe the first natural BoNV genotype 1-2 recombinant, analogous to the previously reported human norovirus recombinants.

Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea in Europe: In-Detail Analyses of Disease Dynamics and Molecular Epidemiology,"<jats:p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease of swine caused by the eponymous virus (PEDV) which belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae virus family. Following the disastrous outbreaks in Asia and the United States, PEDV has been detected also in Europe. In order to better understand the overall situation, the molecular epidemiology, and factors that might influence the most variable disease impact; 40 samples from swine feces were collected from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries and sequenced by shot-gun next-generation sequencing. A total of 38 new PEDV complete coding sequences were generated. When compared on a global scale, all investigated sequences from Central and South-Eastern Europe formed a rather homogeneous PEDV S INDEL cluster, suggesting a recent re-introduction. However, in-detail analyses revealed two new clusters and putative ancestor strains. Based on the available background data, correlations between clusters and location, farm type or clinical presentation could not be established. Additionally, the impact of secondary infections was explored using the metagenomic data sets. While several coinfections were observed, no correlation was found with disease courses. However, in addition to the PEDV genomes, ten complete viral coding sequences from nine different data sets were reconstructed each representing new virus strains. In detail, three pasivirus A strains, two astroviruses, a porcine sapelovirus, a kobuvirus, a porcine torovirus, a posavirus, and an enterobacteria phage were almost fully sequenced.</jats:p>",0

SaV is a causative agent of gastroenteritis in children and adults. SaV can be divided into five genogroups (GI–GV), among which GI, GII, GIV and GV are known to infect humans, whereas SaV GIII infects porcine species. Detection methods include ELISA, RT‐PCR and real‐time RT‐PCR. Since few SaV studies have been conducted, it is difficult to draw correlations between or conclusions about rates of incidence, detection and overall prevalence. Nevertheless, most studies agree that SaV infection is more frequent in young children than adults and that infection in children almost always occurs by 5 years of age. In addition, children at day‐care centres and institutions are at greatest risk of SaV‐associated infection and transmission. Recently, a number of important findings concerning human SaV were discovered. SaV strains were detected in water samples, which included untreated wastewater specimens, treated wastewater samples and river samples. SaV strains were also detected in shellfish samples destined for human consumption, and recombinant SaV strains were identified in a number of different countries. The purpose of this review was to highlight the current knowledge of human SaV, which appears to be an increasingly important virus causing gastroenteritis in humans.

"The Strange, Expanding World of Animal Hepaciviruses","<jats:p> Hepaciviruses and pegiviruses constitute two closely related sister genera of the family Flaviviridae. In the past five years, the known phylogenetic diversity of the hepacivirus genera has absolutely exploded. What was once an isolated infection in humans (and possibly other primates) has now expanded to include horses, rodents, bats, colobus monkeys, cows, and, most recently, catsharks, shedding new light on the genetic diversity and host range of hepaciviruses. Interestingly, despite the identification of these many animal and primate hepaciviruses, the equine hepaciviruses remain the closest genetic relatives of the human hepaciviruses, providing an intriguing clue to the zoonotic source of hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes the significance of these studies and discusses current thinking about the origin and evolution of the animal hepaciviruses as well as their potential usage as surrogate models for the study of hepatitis C virus. </jats:p>",0

"Transmission patterns of human enterovirus 71 to, from and among European countries, 2003 to 2013","<jats:p>Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is involved in epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and has been reported to occur with severe neurological complications in eastern and south-east Asia. In other geographical areas, the transmission of this virus is poorly understood. We used large sequence datasets (of the gene encoding the viral protein 1, VP1) and a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to compare the molecular epidemiology and geographical spread patterns of EV-71 subgenogroups B4, B5, C1, C2, and C4 in Europe relative to other parts of the world. For the study, European countries considered were European Union (EU) Member States and Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  Viruses of the B4, B5, and C4 subgenogroups circulate mainly in eastern and south-east Asia. In Europe sporadic introductions of these subgenogroups are observed, however C1 and C2 viruses predominate. The phylogenies showed evidence of multiple events of spread involving C1 and C2 viruses within Europe since the mid-1990s. Two waves of sporadic C2 infections also occurred in 2010 and 2013. The 2007 Dutch outbreak caused by C2 and the occurrence of B5 and C4 infections in the EU between 2004 and 2013 arose while the circulation of C1 viruses was low. A transmission chain involving a C4 virus was traced from Japan to the EU and then further to Canada between 2001 and 2006. Recent events whereby spread of viruses have occurred from, to, and within Europe appear to be involved in the long term survival of EV-71, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance of this virus.</jats:p>",0

            Family","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            We have recently reported the isolation of a novel virus, provisionally designated C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK), with 50% overall homology to human influenza C viruses (ICV), from a pig in Oklahoma. Deep RNA sequencing of C/OK virus found a matrix 1 (M1) protein expression strategy that differed from that of ICV. The novelty of C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether C/OK virus could exist in a nonswine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in U.S. bovine herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether swine/bovine C/OK viruses can undergo reassortment with human ICV, and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK,
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            reassortment and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were conducted.
            <jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic>
            reassortment using two human ICV and two swine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent split virions was observed in AGID between human and nonhuman viruses by using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive to cognate antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV. The classification of the new virus in a separate genus of the
            <jats:italic>Orthomyxoviridae</jats:italic>
            family is proposed. The finding of C/OK virus in swine and bovine indicates that this new virus may spread and establish infection in other mammals, including humans.

          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Influenza C viruses (ICV) are common human pathogens, infecting most people during childhood and adolescence, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms. While ICV have been isolated from both pigs and dogs, humans are thought to be the natural viral reservoir. Previously, we characterized an ICV-like virus isolated from pigs exhibiting symptoms of influenza virus-like illness. Here, we show molecular and serological data demonstrating widespread circulation of similar viruses in bovines. Deep RNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            reassortment experiments demonstrate that animal ICV-like viruses are genetically distinct from human ICV. Antigenically, we show that ICV-like viruses are not recognized by ICV antibodies. En masse, these results suggest that bovine influenza virus warrants classification as a new genus of influenza virus. The finding of this novel virus that can infect multiple mammalian species warrants further research into its role in human health.

"Group A Rotaviruses in Chinese Bats: Genetic Composition, Serology, and Evidence for Bat-to-Human Transmission and Reassortment","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Bats are natural reservoirs for many pathogenic viruses, and increasing evidence supports the notion that bats can also harbor group A rotaviruses (RVAs), important causative agents of diarrhea in children and young animals. Currently, 8 RVA strains possessing completely novel genotype constellations or genotypes possibly originating from other mammals have been identified from African and Chinese bats. However, all the data were mainly based on detection of RVA RNA, present only during acute infections, which does not permit assessment of the true exposure of a bat population to RVA. To systematically investigate the genetic diversity of RVAs, 547 bat anal swabs or gut samples along with 448 bat sera were collected from five South Chinese provinces. Specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening found four RVA strains. Strain GLRL1 possessed a completely novel genotype constellation, whereas the other three possessed a constellation consistent with the MSLH14-like genotype, a newly characterized group of viruses widely prevalent in Chinese insectivorous bats. Among the latter, strain LZHP2 provided strong evidence of cross-species transmission of RVAs from bats to humans, whereas strains YSSK5 and BSTM70 were likely reassortants between typical MSLH14-like RVAs and human RVAs. RVA-specific antibodies were detected in 10.7% (48/448) of bat sera by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). Bats in Guangxi and Yunnan had a higher RVA-specific antibody prevalence than those from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. These observations provide evidence for cross-species transmission of MSLH14-like bat RVAs to humans, highlighting the impact of bats as reservoirs of RVAs on public health.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Bat viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses, are important pathogens causing outbreaks of severe emerging infectious diseases. However, little is known about bat viruses capable of causing gastroenteritis in humans, even though 8 group A viruses (RVAs) have been identified from bats so far. In this study, another 4 RVA strains were identified, with one providing strong evidence for zoonotic transmission from bats to humans. Serological investigation has also indicated that RVA infection in bats is far more prevalent than expected based on the detection of viral RNA.

Characterization of a Novel G3P[3] Rotavirus Isolated from a Lesser Horseshoe Bat: a Distant Relative of Feline/Canine Rotaviruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bats are considered important animal reservoirs for many viruses pathogenic to humans. An approach based on viral metagenomics was used to study gut specimens from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. Seventy-four reads were found to be related to group A rotavirus (RVA). Further reverse transcription-PCR screening and viral isolation on cell cultures confirmed the presence of a novel RVA strain, named RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3], in 1 (6%) of 16 lesser horseshoe bats. Full genomic sequencing analyses showed that MSLH14 possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which is akin to human and animal rotaviruses believed to be of feline/canine origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VP7 was most closely related to bovine RVA strains from India, whereas VP4 was most closely related to an unusual human RVA strain, CMH222, with animal characteristics isolated in Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a range of animal RVA strains, most of which are believed to be related to feline/canine RVAs. Experimental infection showed that bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic to suckling mice, causing 100% mortality when they were inoculated orally with a titer as low as 5 × 10
            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>
            50% tissue culture infective doses. As this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strain, it is tempting to speculate that it is a true bat RVA strain rather than a virus transmitted between species. However, further screening of bat populations, preferably juvenile animals, will be crucial in determining whether or not this virus is widely distributed in the bat population.

Electrostatic Variation of Haemagglutinin as a Hallmark of the Evolution of Avian Influenza Viruses,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Avian influenza virus is a zoonotic agent that significantly impacts public health and the poultry industry. Monitoring viral evolution and spread is crucial for surveillance and tracing programmes, which are currently based on serological or DNA sequencing-phylogenetics analysis. However, virus-host interactions, antigenic drift and spreading of viral clades strongly depend on variation in the surface features of capsid proteins. We report here that <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic> comparative structural analysis of haemagglutinin can reveal relevant evolutionary fingerprints, particularly when integrated with sequence-based analyses. Phylogenetic analyses of H9 viral strains from wild birds and poultry, performed with different methods, reliably led to clustering of viruses into five main groups. Subsequent comparison of structural features showed congruence between such clustering and surface electrostatic fingerprints. These latter fingerprints relate group-specific variations in electrostatic charges and isocontours to well-known haemagglutinin sites involved in the modulation of immune escape and host specificity. This work suggests that the integration of structural and sequence comparisons may enhance investigations of trends and relevant mechanisms in viral evolution.</jats:p>",0

Emergence of a new strain of type O foot-and-mouth disease virus: its phylogenetic and evolutionary relationship with the PanAsia pandemic strain.,Virus Genes,0
Genetic analysis of foot-and-mouth disease virus type O isolates responsible for field outbreaks in India between 1993 and 1999,"<jats:p>Partial nucleotide sequence at the 3′ end of 1D (VP1-encoding) gene of 90 foot-and-mouth 
disease virus type O isolates recovered from field outbreaks in India between 1993–9 were 
determined. The sequences were compared with each other and reference viruses. The published 
sequences of 15 type O isolates recovered from different parts of Asia and one isolate (O1BFS) 
from Europe and one from Egypt (O1/Sharquia/Egypt/72) were also included in the analysis 
for comparison. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis the viruses could be grouped into four 
distinct genotypes (genotypes I–IV). All 90 isolates from India were genotype-I, as were the 
reference isolates from Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey. 
Genotype-I isolates were further subdivided into 16 sub-genotypes. The Indian isolates were 
found to be extremely heterogeneous in nature and clustered into 12 different genetic groups. 
In genotype-I, the nucleotide sequence difference seen between the isolates was 0–11·6%, while 
among the Indian isolates it is 0–8·8%. Viruses of similar genetic groups are circulating in 
India, Bangladesh and countries of the Middle East. Genotype-II and -III are represented by 
isolates from Lebanon (O1/South Lebanon) and Europe (O1-BFS), respectively. Genotype-IV 
is formed by isolates from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The present study reveals the 
occurrence of viruses belonging to multiple genetic groups over a short period of time and 
persistence of single genetic group in the same geographical area over several years. This is 
consistent with the endemic nature of the disease in the country.</jats:p>",0

"Metagenomic identification, seasonal dynamics, and potential transmission mechanisms of a <i>Daphnia</i>‐associated single‐stranded DNA virus in two temperate lakes","<jats:p>We used a metagenomic approach to identify viruses that may be involved in the ecology of <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> spp. in Oneida and Cayuga lakes (upstate New York). We identified several highly represented, putative eukaryotic, circular, single‐stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viral genomes. Among these, we discovered a genotype similar in both sequence and genomic architecture to a virus previously reported from a hyperthermal lake that shares characteristics of both single‐stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) and single‐stranded DNA viruses. We used quantitative polymerase chain reactions to study the prevalence and viral load of both positive‐sense and negative‐sense strands of the <jats:italic>Daphnia mendotae</jats:italic>‐associated (Cladocera) hybrid virus (DMClaHV) over a summer season in Oneida and Cayuga lakes. DMClaHV had high prevalence within <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> populations, where viral load and the proportion of virus‐positive individuals were higher preceding host population decline. DMClaHV viral load was different between two species of <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>D. mendotae</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>D. retrocurva</jats:italic>), and the dynamics between viruses and their hosts varied between the two lakes. We detected DMClaHV in eggs (ephippia) retrieved from Oneida Lake sediments with an estimated age of 30 yr. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed small (20 nm diameter) virus‐like particles in <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> that were well away from gut tissues and not associated with intracellular parasites. Because <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> plays a critical role in many lake ecosystems, DMClaHV may have important effects on herbivory and thus carbon flow through the lake ecosystem.</jats:p>",0
Application of high‐resolution melt curve analysis for classification of infectious bronchitis viruses in field specimens,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Objective </jats:bold> A real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/high‐resolution melt (HRM) curve analysis protocol was developed in our laboratory to differentiate infectious bronchitis (IB) virus reference strains. In the current study, this method was used to detect and classify IB viruses in field submissions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Procedure </jats:bold> Over an 11‐month period samples from 40 cases of suspected IB virus were received and 17 submissions were positive for IB virus by polymerase chain reaction. HRM curve analysis classified each strain as subgroup 1, 2 or 3 strain (12 submissions) or a strain that was unable to be classified (5 submissions). The 3′ untranslated region (UTR) and partial S1 gene nucleotide sequences for the 17 IB virus strains were determined and their identity with those of the relative reference strains compared to confirm the classifications generated using the HRM curve analysis.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> Of the 12 IB field viruses classified as subgroup 1, 2, or 3 using HRM curve analysis, the 3′UTR and S1 gene nucleotide sequences had identities ≥99% with the respective subgroup reference strain. Analysis of the 3′ UTR and S1 gene nucleotide sequences for the five IB virus strains that could not be classified indicated that four belonged to one of the subgroups, and one was a potential recombinant strain (between strains from subgroups 2 and 3). A novel recombinant strain was also detected.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion </jats:bold> HRM curve analysis can rapidly assign the majority of IB viruses present in field submissions to known subgroups. Importantly, HRM curve analysis also identified variant genotypes that require further investigation.</jats:p>",0

Transmission of influenza reflects seasonality of wild birds across the annual cycle,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Influenza A Viruses (IAV) in nature must overcome shifting transmission barriers caused by the mobility of their primary host, migratory wild birds, that change throughout the annual cycle. Using a phylogenetic network of viral sequences from North American wild birds (2008–2011) we demonstrate a shift from intraspecific to interspecific transmission that along with reassortment, allows IAV to achieve viral flow across successive seasons from summer to winter. Our study supports amplification of IAV during summer breeding seeded by overwintering virus persisting locally and virus introduced from a wide range of latitudes. As birds migrate from breeding sites to lower latitudes, they become involved in transmission networks with greater connectivity to other bird species, with interspecies transmission of reassortant viruses peaking during the winter. We propose that switching transmission dynamics may be a critical strategy for pathogens that infect mobile hosts inhabiting regions with strong seasonality.</jats:p>",0

"TTV, a new human virus with single stranded circular DNA genome","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>TT virus (TTV) was found in 1997 from a hepatitis patient without virus markers. However, the real impact of TTV on liver diseases remains uncertain to date. Due to the lack of suitable cell systems to support the growth of TTV, the biology of TTV is still obscure. This review tries to summarise the current status of TTV on aspects other than the taxonomic diversity of TTV. TTV was the first human virus with a single stranded circular DNA genome. TTV was considered to be a member of <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, but others suggested it conformed to a new family. TTV is distinct from ambisense viruses in the genus <jats:italic>Circovirus</jats:italic>, since the former genome is negative stranded. The genome structure of TTV is more related to chicken anaemia virus in the genus <jats:italic>Gyrovirus</jats:italic>, however, the sequence similarity is minimal except for a short stretch at 3816–3851 of TA278. Currently the working group is proposing the full name for TTV as TorqueTenoVirus and the TTV‐like mini virus as TorqueTenoMiniVirus (TTMV) in a new genus <jats:italic>Anellovirus</jats:italic> (ring). TTVs are prevalent in non‐human primates and human TTV can cross‐infect chimpanzees. Furthermore, TTV sequences have been detected in chickens, pigs, cows and sheep. TTV can be transmitted by mother‐to‐child infection. However, within a year after birth, the prevalence reaches the same level for children born to both TTV‐positive and TTV‐negative mothers even without breast‐feeding. The non‐coding region surrounding a short 113 nt GC‐rich stretch and occupying approximately one‐third of the genome is considered to contain the putative replication origin. Three mRNAs are expressed by TTV, 3.0 and 1.2 and 1.0 kb species. A protein translated from the 3.0 kb mRNA is considered to be the major capsid protein as well as replicase. The nature of the proteins translated by the other two mRNAs are still putative. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",0
Torque teno virus (TTV): current status,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Torque teno virus (TTV), currently classified into the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, genus <jats:italic>Anellovirus,</jats:italic> was first found in a patient with non‐A‐E hepatitis. TTV has a single stranded circular DNA of ∼3.8 kb. TTVs are extraordinarily diverse, spanning five groups including SANBAN and SEN viruses. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) with ∼2.9 kb genome also has wide variants. Recently, two related 2.2‐ and 2.6‐kb species joined this community. Recombinations between variants are frequent. This extensive TTV diversity remains unexplained; it is unclear how TTVs could be viable, and why they require such genetic variation. An unequivocal culture system is still not available. TTVs are ubiquitous in &gt; 90% of adults worldwide but no human pathogenicity of TTV has been fully established. Epidemiological surveys need to specify the variants being studied and clinical targets, and must calibrate the sensitivity of the assay used. Potentially interesting observations include a higher viral load in patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, cancer and lupus. Active replication was also found in infants with acute respiratory diseases. TTV/TTMV‐related viruses were found in chimpanzees, apes, African monkeys and tupaias, and also in chickens, pigs, cows, sheep and dogs. Experimentally, rhesus monkeys were persistently infected by TTV, but only 1/53 chimpanzees. TTV transcribes three species of mRNAs, 3.0‐, 1.2‐ and 1.0‐kb in the ratio of 60:5:35. Recently, at least three mRNAs were shown in chicken anaemia virus. The genomic region −154/−76 contains a critical promoter. TTV seems to have at least three proteins; however, the definite functions of these proteins await further research work. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",0

Conservation of L and 3C proteinase activities across distantly related aphthoviruses,"<jats:p>The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader (L) proteinase is an important virulence determinant in FMDV infections. It possesses two distinct catalytic activities: (i) C-terminal processing at the L/VP4 junction; and (ii) induction of the cleavage of translation initiation factor eIF4G, an event that inhibits cap-dependent translation in infected cells. The only other member of the <jats:italic>Aphthovirus</jats:italic> genus, equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), also encodes an L protein, but this shares only 32% amino acid identity with its FMDV counterpart. Another more distantly related picornavirus, equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV), which is not classified as an aphthovirus, also encodes an L protein. Using <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> transcription and translation analysis, we have shown that both ERAV and ERBV L proteins have C-terminal processing activity. Furthermore, expression of ERAV L, but not ERBV L, in BHK-21 cells resulted in the efficient inhibition of cap-dependent translation in these cells. We have shown that the ERAV and FMDV L proteinases induce cleavage of eIF4GI at very similar or identical positions. Interestingly, ERAV 3C also induces eIF4GI cleavage and again produces distinct products that co-migrate with those induced by FMDV 3C. The ERBV L proteinase does not induce eIF4GI cleavage, consistent with its inability to shut down cap-dependent translation. We have also shown that another unique feature of FMDV L, the stimulation of enterovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity, is also shared by the ERAV L proteinase but not by ERBV L. The functional conservation of the divergent ERAV and FMDV proteinases indicates the likelihood of a similar and important role for these enzymes in the pathogenesis of infections caused by these distantly related aphthoviruses.</jats:p>",0

THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE RECEPTORS OF A NEW STRAIN OF VIRUS TO THOSE OF THE MUMPS-NDV-INFLUENZA GROUP,"<jats:p>The interrelationships of the cellular receptors and the hemagglutinin inhibitors of a new strain of virus (1233) to members of the mumps-Newcastle disease-influenza group have been investigated. It was found that strain. 1233 does not destroy the receptors or inhibitors of the other group, nor does the latter destroy 1233 receptors or inhibitor. The sole exception to this statement was a moderate destruction of 1233 inhibitor in egg white by Newcastle disease virus. The classification of strain 1233 was discussed in the light of this evidence, evidence which tends to place strain 1233 in a different category from that of any other strain of the MNI group.</jats:p>",0

"Rapid detection, characterization, and enumeration of foodborne pathogens","<jats:p>J. Hoorfar. Rapid detection, characterization, and enumeration of foodborne pathogens. APMIS 2011; 119 (Suppl. 133): 1–24.</jats:p><jats:p>As food safety management further develops, microbiological testing will continue to play an important role in assessing whether Food Safety Objectives are achieved. However, traditional microbiological culture‐based methods are limited, particularly in their ability to provide timely data. The present review discusses the reasons for the increasing interest in rapid methods, current developments in the field, the research needs, and the future trends. The advent of biotechnology has introduced new technologies that led to the emergence of rapid diagnostic methods and altered food testing practices. Rapid methods are comprised of many different detection technologies, including specialized enzyme substrates, antibodies and DNA, ranging from simple differential plating media to the use of sophisticated instruments. The use of non‐invasive sampling techniques for live animals especially came into focus with the 1990s outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy that was linked to the human outbreak of Creutzfeldt Jakob’s Disease. Serology is still an important tool in preventing foodborne pathogens to enter the human food supply through meat and milk from animals. One of the primary uses of rapid methods is for fast screening of large number of samples, where most of them are expected to be test‐negative, leading to faster product release for sale. This has been the main strength of rapid methods such as real‐time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Enrichment PCR, where a primary culture broth is tested in PCR, is the most common approach in rapid testing. Recent reports show that it is possible both to enrich a sample and enumerate by pathogen‐specific real‐time PCR, if the enrichment time is short. This can be especially useful in situations where food producers ask for the level of pathogen in a contaminated product. Another key issue is automation, where the key drivers are miniaturization and multiple testing, which mean that not only one instrument is flexible enough to test for many pathogens but also many pathogens can be detected with one test. The review is mainly based on the author’s scientific work that has contributed with the following new developments to this field: (i) serologic tests for large‐scale screening, surveillance, or eradication programs, (ii) same‐day detection of<jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>that otherwise was considered as difficult to achieve, (iii) pathogen enumeration following a short log‐phase enrichment, (iv) detection of foodborne pathogens in air samples, and finally (v) biotracing of pathogens based on mathematical modeling, even in the absence of isolate. Rapid methods are discussed in a broad global health perspective, international food supply, and for improvement of quantitative microbial risk assessments. The need for quantitative sample preparation techniques, culture‐independent, metagenomic‐based detection, online monitoring, a global validation infrastructure has been emphasized. The cost and ease of use of rapid assays remain challenging obstacles to surmount.</jats:p>",0
Biological and Biochemical Characterization of Sheep Scrapie in Japan,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Due to the apparent absence of an agent-specific nucleic acid genome, scrapie strains cannot be classified by genome characterization, which is commonly used for the classification of many viruses. However, scrapie strains can be distinguished to some extent by biological properties such as transmissibility to experimental animals and distribution of neuropathological lesions and by biochemical properties such as the molecular mass and relative protease-resistance of the disease-specific isoform of prion protein (PrP
            <jats:sup>Sc</jats:sup>
            ). In order to preliminarily characterize the scrapie strains that are prevalent in Japan, we analyzed the transmissibility of sheep scrapie isolates to mice and the relative proteinase K (PK) resistance of the corresponding PrP
            <jats:sup>Sc</jats:sup>
            . The results indicate that Japanese scrapie strains can be divided into at least three groups based on biological and biochemical properties. The first group includes isolates which cause disease in mice with an incubation period of ∼400 days and possess PrP
            <jats:sup>Sc</jats:sup>
            with relatively high PK resistance. Isolates of the second group contain PrP
            <jats:sup>Sc</jats:sup>
            that is highly resistant to PK digestion but transmit poorly to mice. The final group consists of isolates that cause disease in mice with an incubation period of less than 300 days and are associated with PrP
            <jats:sup>Sc</jats:sup>
            with reduced PK resistance. Sheep scrapie has occurred sporadically in Japan since1982, with only ∼60 officially reported cases so far. However, the diversity of scrapie strains in the field suggested by our data raises the concern that a scrapie strain similar to the parental agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy could exist or emerge in Japan. Thus, continuous surveillance for scrapie will be required to prevent the further spread of scrapie, not only among the sheep population but also to other species, and to eliminate any potential risk of sheep scrapie to public health.

Molecular and phylogenetic analyses of a new Amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV-1313),"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The amphotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLV-A's) are naturally occurring, exogenously acquired gammaretroviruses that are indigenous to the Southern California wild mice. These viruses replicate in a wide range of cell types including human cells <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> and they can cause both hematological and neurological disorders in feral as well as in the inbred laboratory mice. Since MuLV-A's also exhibit discrete interference and neutralization properties, the envelope proteins of these viruses have been extremely useful for studying virus-host cell interactions and as vehicles for transfer of foreign genes into a variety of hosts including human cells. However, the genomic structure of any of the several known MuLV-A's has not been established and the evolutionary relationship of amphotropic retroviruses to the numerous exogenous or endogenous MuLV strains remains elusive. Herein we present a complete genetic structure of a novel amphotropic virus designated MuLV-1313 and demonstrate that this retrovirus together with other MuLV-A's belongs to a distinct molecular, biological and phylogenetic class among the MuLV strains isolated from a large number of the laboratory inbred or feral mice.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The host range of MuLV-1313 is similar to the previously isolated MuLV-A's except that this virus replicates efficiently in mammalian as well as in chicken cells. Compared to ENV proteins of other MuLV-A's (4070A, 1504A and 10A-1), the gp70 protein of MuLV-1313 exhibits differences in its signal peptides and the proline-rich hinge regions. However, the MuLV-1313 envelope protein is totally unrelated to those present in a broad range of murine retroviruses that have been isolated from various inbred and feral mice globally. Genetic analysis of the entire MuLV-1313 genome by dot plot analyses, which compares each nucleotide of one genome with the corresponding nucleotide of another, revealed that the genome of this virus, with the exception of the <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> gene, is more closely related to the biologically distinct wild mouse ecotropic retrovirus (Cas-Br-E) isolated from another region of the Southern California, than to any of the 15 MuLV strains whose full-length sequences are present in the GenBank. This finding was corroborated by phylogenetic analyses and hierarchical clustering of the entire genomic sequence of MuLV-1313, which also placed all MULV-A's in a genetically distinct category among the large family of retroviruses isolated from numerous mouse strains globally. Likewise, construction of separate dendrograms for each of the Gag, Pol and Env proteins of MuLV-1313 demonstrated that the amphotropic retroviruses belong to a phylogenetically exclusive group of gammaretroviruses compared to all known MuLV strains.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The molecular, biological and phylogenetic properties of amphotropic retroviruses including MuLV-1313 are distinct compared to a large family of exogenously- or endogenously-transmitted ecotropic, polytropic and xenotropic MuLV strains of the laboratory and feral mice. Further, both the naturally occurring amphotropic and a biologically discrete ecotropic retrovirus of the Southern California wild mice are more closely related to each other on the evolutionary tree than any other mammalian gammaretrovirus indicating a common origin of these viruses. This is the first report of a complete genomic analysis of a unique group of phylogenetically distinct amphotropic virus.</jats:p>

Detection of diverse novel astroviruses from small mammals in China,"<jats:p>Astroviruses infect humans and many animal species and cause gastroenteritis. To extensively understand the distribution and genetic diversity of astrovirus in small mammals, we tested 968 anal swabs from 39 animal species, most of which were bats and rodents. We detected diverse astroviruses in 10 bat species, including known bat astroviruses and a large number of novel viruses. Meanwhile, novel groups of astroviruses were identified in three wild rodent species and a remarkably high genetic diversity of astrovirus was revealed in <jats:italic>Eothenomys cachinus</jats:italic>. We detected astroviruses in captive-bred porcupines and a nearly full-length genome sequence was determined for one strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete ORF2 sequence suggested that this strain may share a common ancestor with porcine astrovirus type 2. Moreover, to our knowledge, this study reports the first discovery of astroviruses in shrews and pikas. Our results provide new insights for understanding these small mammals as natural reservoirs of astroviruses.</jats:p>",0

Virome analysis for identification of novel mammalian viruses in bats from Southeast China,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Bats have been shown as important mammal resevoirs to carry a variety of zoonotic pathogens. To analyze pathogenic species in bats from southeast coastal regions of China, we performed metagenomic sequencing technology for high throughput sequencing of six sentinels from southeast coastal area of China. We obtained 5,990,261 high quality reads from intestine and lung tissue of 235 bats, including 2,975,371 assembled sequences. 631,490 reads predicted overlapping sequences for the open reading frame (ORF), which accounts for 2.37% of all the sequences (15,012/631,490). Further, the acquired virus sequences were classified into 25 viral families, including 16 vertebrate viruses, four plant viruses and five insect viruses. All bat samples were screened by specific PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Using these techniques, we discovered many novel bat viruses and some bat viruses closely-related to known human/animal pathogens, including coronavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, astrovirus, and circovirus. In summary, this study extended our understanding of bats as the viral reservoirs. Additionally, it also provides a basis for furher studying the transmission of viruses from bats to humans.</jats:p>",0

"Detection of a novel porcine parvovirus, PPV4, in chinese swine herds","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:p>To determine whether the novel porcine parvovirus type 4 (PPV4) recently reported in America is prevalent in China, a set of specific primers was designed and used for molecular survey of PPV4 among the clinical samples collected from various provinces of China between 2006 and 2010. The results showed that PPV4 is present in Chinese swine herds at a rate of 2.09% (12/573) among the clinical samples examined and 0.76% (1/132) among the samples taken from healthy animals. We also noted that PPV4 was not detected in samples taken prior to 2009. Analysis of the coding sequences showed that the Chinese and American PPV4 genome sequences are closely related with greater than 99% nucleotide sequence identity. Similar to a previous study, viral genomes in head-to-tail configuration of various lengths of the non-coding region were detected. Our findings confirmed that PPV4 is a unique recently discovered virus in pigs. Phylogenetically, PPV4 is most closely related to bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2, which is not a <jats:italic>Bocavirus</jats:italic> and is not assigned to any <jats:italic>Parvovirinae</jats:italic> genus) and shares limited ORF1 (33.6%) and ORF2 (24.5%) amino acid identity. With respect to genome structure and organization, PPV4 encodes an ORF3 in the middle of the viral genome that resembles the <jats:italic>Bocavirus</jats:italic> genus. However, the PPV4 ORF3 encoded protein shares minimal amino acid identity with the ORF3 encoded proteins of the <jats:italic>Bocavirus</jats:italic> genus.</jats:p>",0

A Selective Bottleneck Shapes the Evolutionary Mutant Spectra of Enterovirus A71 during Viral Dissemination in Humans,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>RNA viruses accumulate mutations to rapidly adapt to environmental changes. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes various clinical manifestations with occasional severe neurological complications. However, the mechanism by which EV-A71 evolves within the human body is unclear. Utilizing deep sequencing and haplotype analyses of viruses from various tissues of an autopsy patient, we sought to define the evolutionary pathway by which enterovirus A71 evolves fitness for invading the central nervous system in humans. Broad mutant spectra with divergent mutations were observed at the initial infection sites in the respiratory and digestive systems. After viral invasion, we identified a haplotype switch and dominant haplotype, with glycine at VP1 residue 31 (VP1-31G) in viral particles disseminated into the integumentary and central nervous systems.<jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic>viral growth and fitness analyses indicated that VP1-31G conferred growth and a fitness advantage in human neuronal cells, whereas VP1-31D conferred enhanced replication in human colorectal cells. A higher proportion of VP1-31G was also found among fatal cases, suggesting that it may facilitate central nervous system infection in humans. Our data provide the first glimpse of EV-A71 quasispecies from oral tissues to the central nervous system within humans, showing broad implications for the surveillance and pathogenesis of this reemerging viral pathogen.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>EV-A71 continues to be a worldwide burden to public health. Although EV-A71 is the major etiological agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease, it can also cause neurological pulmonary edema, encephalitis, and even death, especially in children. Understanding selection processes enabling dissemination and accurately estimating EV-A71 diversity during invasion in humans are critical for applications in viral pathogenesis and vaccine studies. Here, we define a selection bottleneck appearing in respiratory and digestive tissues. Glycine substitution at VP1 residue 31 helps viruses break through the bottleneck and invade the central nervous system. This substitution is also advantageous for replication in neuronal cells<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. Considering that fatal cases contain enhanced glycine substitution at VP1-31, we suggest that the increased prevalence of VP1-31G may alter viral tropism and aid central nervous system invasion. Our findings provide new insights into a dynamic mutant spectral switch active during acute viral infection with emerging viral pathogens.</jats:p>",0

"A 4-year study of avian influenza virus prevalence and subtype diversity in ducks of Newfoundland, Canada","<jats:p>The island of Newfoundland, Canada, is at the eastern edge of North America and has migratory bird connections with the continental mainland as well as across the North Atlantic Ocean. Here, we report a 4-year avian influenza virus (AIV) epidemiological study in ducks in the St. John’s region of Newfoundland. The overall prevalence of AIV detection in ducks during this study was 7.2%, with American Black Ducks contributing the vast majority of the collected samples and the AIV positives. The juvenile ducks showed a significantly higher AIV detection rate (10.6%) compared with adults (3.4%). Seasonally, AIV prevalence rates were higher in the autumn (8.4%), but positives were still detected in the winter (4.6%). Preliminary serology tests showed a high incidence of previous AIV infection (20/38, 52.6%). A total of 43 viruses were characterized for their HA–NA or HA subtypes, which revealed a large diversity of AIV subtypes and little recurrence of subtypes from year to year. Investigation of the movement patterns of ducks in this region showed that it is a largely non-migratory duck population, which may contribute to the observed pattern of high AIV subtype turnover. Phylogenetic analysis of 4 H1N1 and one H5N4 AIVs showed these viruses were highly similar to other low pathogenic AIV sequences from waterfowl in North America and assigned all gene segments into American-avian clades. Notably, the H1N1 viruses, which were identified in consecutive years, possessed homologous genomes. Such detection of homologous AIV genomes across years is rare, but indicates the role of the environmental reservoir in viral perpetuation.</jats:p>",0

Our study explores and deepens the current understanding of CA9.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>We analyzed the clinical presentations of 100 culture-proven CA9-infected patients in 2011 by reviewing their medical records and depicted the CA9 phylogenetic tree.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Of the 100 patients with culture-proven CA9 infections, the mean (SD) age was 4.6 (3.4) years and the male to female ratio was 1.9. For clinical manifestations, 96 patients (96%) had fever and the mean (SD) duration of fever was 5.9 (3.4) days. Sixty one patients (61%) developed a skin rash, and the predominant pattern was a generalized non-itchy maculopapular rash without vesicular changes. While most patients showed injected throat, oral ulcers were found in only 19 cases (19%), among whom, 6 were diagnosed as herpangina. Complicated cases included: aseptic meningitis (n=8), bronchopneumonia (n=6), acute cerebellitis (n=1), and polio-like syndrome (n=1).

The Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase Protein of Newcastle Disease Virus Determines Tropism and Virulence,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) plays a crucial role in the process of infection. However, the exact contribution of the HN gene to NDV pathogenesis is not known. In this study, the role of the HN gene in NDV virulence was examined. By use of reverse genetics procedures, the HN genes of a virulent recombinant NDV strain, rBeaudette C (rBC), and an avirulent recombinant NDV strain, rLaSota, were exchanged. The hemadsorption and neuraminidase activities of the chimeric viruses showed significant differences from those of their parental strains, but heterotypic F and HN pairs were equally effective in fusion promotion. The tissue tropism of the viruses was shown to be dependent on the origin of the HN protein. The chimeric virus with the HN protein derived from the virulent virus exhibited a tissue predilection similar to that of the virulent virus, and vice versa. The chimeric viruses with reciprocal HN proteins either gained or lost virulence, as determined by a standard intracerebral pathogenicity index test of chickens and by the mean death time in chicken embryos (a measure devised to classify these viruses), indicating that virulence is a function of the amino acid differences in the HN protein. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the virulence of NDV is multigenic and that the cleavability of F protein alone does not determine the virulence of a strain.</jats:p>",0

Oral Fluids as a Live-Animal Sample Source for Evaluating Cross-Reactivity and Cross-Protection following Intranasal Influenza A Virus Vaccination in Pigs,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>In North American swine, there are numerous antigenically distinct H1 influenza A virus (IAV) variants currently circulating, making vaccine development difficult due to the inability to formulate a vaccine that provides broad cross-protection. Experimentally, live-attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines demonstrate increased cross-protection compared to inactivated vaccines. However, there is no standardized assay to predict cross-protection following LAIV vaccination. Hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody in serum is the gold standard correlate of protection following IAV vaccination. LAIV vaccination does not induce a robust serum HI antibody titer; however, a local mucosal antibody response is elicited. Thus, a live-animal sample source that could be used to evaluate LAIV immunogenicity and cross-protection is needed. Here, we evaluated the use of oral fluids (OF) and nasal wash (NW) collected after IAV inoculation as a live-animal sample source in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to predict cross-protection in comparison to traditional serology. Both live-virus exposure and LAIV vaccination provided heterologous protection, though protection was greatest against more closely phylogenetically related viruses. IAV-specific IgA was detected in NW and OF samples and was cross-reactive to representative IAV from each H1 cluster. Endpoint titers of cross-reactive IgA in OF from pigs exposed to live virus was associated with heterologous protection. While LAIV vaccination provided significant protection, LAIV immunogenicity was reduced compared to live-virus exposure. These data suggest that OF from pigs inoculated with wild-type IAV, with surface genes that match the LAIV seed strain, could be used in an ELISA to assess cross-protection and the antigenic relatedness of circulating and emerging IAV in swine.</jats:p>",0

Herd immunity and fatal cases of influenza among the population exposed to poultry and wild birds in Russian Asia in 2013–2014,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>In total 1,525 blood serum samples were collected in October, 2013 in Russian Asia from people who reside in territories that are at high risk for emergence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Presence of antibodies to influenza viruses in the sera was tested in hemagglutination inhibition test. None of the samples produced positive results with the antigens A/H5 and A/H7. Twelve strains of influenza A(H1N1pdm09) virus were isolated from people who died presumably from influenza during 2013–2014 epidemic season. All strains were similar to vaccine strain A/California/07/09 according to their antigenic properties and sensitivity to anti‐neuraminidase drugs (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Genetic analysis revealed that all strains belong to group 6, subgroup 6B of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Substitutions in HA1: S164F add E235K as well as E47G, A86V, K331R, N386K, N397K in NA, and K131E, N29S in NS1, and N29S, R34Q in NEP separate investigated strains into two groups: 1st group—A/Chita/1114/2014, A/Chita/1115/2014, A/Chita/853/2014, A/Barnaul/269/2014 and 2nd group—A/Chita/655/2014, A/Chita/656/2014, A/Chita/709/2014, A/Chita/873/2014.

Molecular Identification of Enteroviruses from Cattle and Goat Feces and Environment in Thailand,"<jats:p>Possible new EV-E and EV-G genotypes were identified for EVs detected in this study. The EV-E viruses were also successfully isolated from MDBK cells. The goat EV sequence analysis suggested the presence of an ovine/caprine-specific EV group that is different from EV-G of porcine origin. The significance of our research is that it identifies and characterizes possible novel EVs, thereby indicating that enteroviruses in animals are continually evolving. The facts that enteroviruses can persist in the environment, contaminate it for long periods, and be transmitted between animals raise serious concerns regarding this group of viruses as emerging livestock pathogens.</jats:p>",0
Variations in the major envelope glycoprotein GP5 of Czech strains of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus,"<jats:p>The major envelope glycoprotein genes (ORF5) of seven Czech isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were amplified and their nucleotide sequences were determined. ORF5 displayed nucleotide and amino acid identities of 87·5–100% and 87·6–100%, respectively, among the isolates. In a phylogenetic tree, all European isolates were grouped in a genotype distinct from that of reference American strains (VR-2332, IAF-Klop). Among the European isolates, two different clades were identified. Two Czech isolates (V-501 and V-503) and Italian strain PRRSV 2156 fell into one clade. The remaining European strains comprised the second clade. Surprisingly, two separately clustered strains (V-501 and V-516) were isolated from the same herd. Additionally, the possible effect of <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> cultivation on the nucleotide sequence was analysed.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of viral DNA, indirect immunofluorescence assays using monoclonal antibodies, partial nucleotide sequencing of the envelope gene, phylogenetic analysis and PCR–RFLP were carried out. These analyses revealed that the parapoxviruses were divided into four groups and the region sequenced in this study was highly conserved within each group. Each of the Japanese isolates was classified into one of these groups. These findings also indicated that parapoxvirus infections among wild Japanese serows seem to be caused by at least two different parapoxviruses, bovine papular stomatitis virus and orf virus. The methods presented here are useful for genetic characterization and classification of parapoxviruses.</jats:p>",0

The intestinal microbiome of the pig,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The intestinal microbiome has been the subject of study for many decades because of its importance in the health and well being of animals. The bacterial components of the intestinal microbiome have closely evolved as animals have and in so doing contribute to the overall development and metabolic needs of the animal. The microbiome of the pig has been the subject of many investigations using culture-dependent methods and more recently using culture-independent techniques. A review of the literature is consistent with many of the ecologic principles put forth by Rene Dubos. Animals develop an intestinal microbiome over time and space. During the growth and development of the pig, the microbiome changes in composition in a process known as the microbial succession. There are clear and distinct differences in the composition of the pig intestinal microbiome moving from the proximal end of the intestinal tract to the distal end. The majority (&gt;90%) of the bacteria in the pig intestinal microbiome are from two Phyla: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. However, the ileum has a high percentage of bacteria in the phylum Proteobacterium (up to 40%). Perturbations to the microbiome occur in response to many factors including stresses, treatment with antibiotics, and diet.</jats:p>",0

Genetic Analysis of Avian Influenza Viruses: Cocirculation of Avian Influenza Viruses with Allele A and B Nonstructural Gene in Northern Pintail (<i>Anas acuta</i>) Ducks Wintering in Japan,"<jats:p>The pandemic influenza virus strains of 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2), and 2009 (H1N1) have genes related to avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The nonstructural (NS) gene of AIVs plays a significant role in host-viral interaction. However, little is known about the degree of diversity of this gene in Northern pintail (<jats:italic>Anas acuta</jats:italic>) ducks wintering in Japan. This study describes characteristics of pintail-originated H1N1, H1N2, H1N3, H5N2, H5N3, H5N9, and H7N7 viruses. Most of the viruses were revealed to be  avian strains and not related to pandemic and seasonal flu strains. Nevertheless, the NP genes of 62.5% (5/8) viruses were found closely related to a A/swine/Korea/C12/08, indicating exchange of genetic material and ongoing mammalian-linked evolution of AIVs. Besides, all the viruses, except Aomori/422/07 H1N1, contain PSIQSR*GLF motif usually found in avian, porcine, and human H1 strains. The Aomori/422/07 H1N1 has a PSVQSR*GLF motif identical to a North American strain. This findings linked to an important intercontinental, Asian-American biogeographical interface. Phylogenetically all the viruses were clustered in Eurasian lineage. Cocirculation of allele A and B (NS gene) viruses was evident in the study implying the existence of a wide reservoir of influenza A viruses in pintail wintering in Japan.</jats:p>",0

ViQuaS: an improved reconstruction pipeline for viral quasispecies spectra generated by next-generation sequencing,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Motivation: The combined effect of a high replication rate and the low fidelity of the viral polymerase in most RNA viruses and some DNA viruses results in the formation of a viral quasispecies. Uncovering information about quasispecies populations significantly benefits the study of disease progression, antiviral drug design, vaccine design and viral pathogenesis. We present a new analysis pipeline called ViQuaS for viral quasispecies spectrum reconstruction using short next-generation sequencing reads. ViQuaS is based on a novel reference-assisted de novo assembly algorithm for constructing local haplotypes. A significantly extended version of an existing global strain reconstruction algorithm is also used.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Results: Benchmarking results showed that ViQuaS outperformed three other previously published methods named ShoRAH, QuRe and PredictHaplo, with improvements of at least 3.1–53.9% in recall, 0–12.1% in precision and 0–38.2% in F-score in terms of strain sequence assembly and improvements of at least 0.006–0.143 in KL-divergence and 0.001–0.035 in root mean-squared error in terms of strain frequency estimation, over the next-best algorithm under various simulation settings.

Mixed Triple: Allied Viruses in Unique Recent Isolates of Highly Virulent Type 2 Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Detected by Deep Sequencing,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            In February 2013, very severe acute clinical symptoms were observed in calves, heifers, and dairy cattle in several farms in North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony, Germany. Deep sequencing revealed the coexistence of three distinct genome variants within recent highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 (BVDV-2) isolates. While the major portion (ca. 95%) of the population harbored a duplication of a 222-nucleotide (nt) segment within the p7-NS2-encoding region, the minority reflected the standard structure of a BVDV-2 genome. Additionally, unusual mutations were found in both variants, within the highly conserved p7 protein and close to the p7-NS2 cleavage site. Using a reverse genetic system with a BVDV-2a strain harboring a similar duplication, it could be demonstrated that during replication, genomes without duplication are generated
            <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>
            from genomes with duplication. The major variant with duplication is compulsorily escorted by the minor variant without duplication. RNA secondary structure prediction allowed the analysis of the unique but stable mixture of three BVDV variants and also provided the explanation for their generation. Finally, our results suggest that the variant with duplication plays the major role in the highly virulent phenotype.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            This study emphasizes the importance of full-genome deep sequencing in combination with manual in-depth data analysis for the investigation of viruses in basic research and diagnostics. Here we investigated recent highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus isolates from a 2013 series of outbreaks. We discovered a unique special feature of the viral genome, an unstable duplication of 222 nucleotides which is eventually deleted by viral polymerase activity, leading to an unexpectedly mixed population of viral genomes for all investigated isolates. Our study is of high importance to the field because we demonstrate that these insertion/deletion events allow another level of genome plasticity of plus-strand RNA viruses, in addition to the well-known polymerase-induced single nucleotide variations which are generally considered the main basis for viral adaptation and evolution.

Detection of the Newcastle disease virus and its effect on development of post-vaccination immunity in a commercial flock of laying hens,"<jats:p>The aim of this study was to monitor the concentration of antibodies against Newcastle disease after vaccination of laying hens at the beginning and in the end of the laying period. The study was carried out in one commercial flock of laying hens in Opatovice in the Czech Republic in the years 2008-2010. A total of 280 samples of blood sera were taken from laying hens coming from four poultry houses. The sera were tested by the haemagglutination inhibition test according to the OIE Manual. Virological testing was conducted as a consequence of atypical results of serological testing. Newcastle disease virus RNA was proved by the RT-nested PCR method in the pooled tissue samples of 5 hens, in the samples of intestines with ileocaecal tonsila, in trachea and also in one swab sample from the environment of one house. Based on sequencing analysis and subsequent phylogenetic analysis, the virus was identified as a low pathogenic strain of paramyxovirus (PMV-1). This low pathogenic strain did not have any impact on the health of laying hens.</jats:p>",0

Integrative analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs of pulmonary alveolar macrophages from piglets during H1N1 swine influenza A virus infection,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>H1N1 swine influenza A virus (H1N1 SwIV) is one key subtype of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. MiRNAs relevant with H1N1 SwIV have rarely been reported. To understand the biological functions of miRNAs during H1N1 SwIV infection, this study profiled differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in pulmonary alveolar macrophages from piglets during the H1N1 SwIV infection using a deep sequencing approach, which was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Compared to control group, 70 and 16 DE miRNAs were respectively identified on post-infection day (PID) 4 and PID 7. 56 DE miRNAs were identified between PID 4 and PID 7. Our results suggest that most host miRNAs are down-regulated to defend the H1N1 SwIV infection during the acute phase of swine influenza whereas their expression levels gradually return to normal during the recovery phase to avoid the occurrence of too severe porcine lung damage. In addition, targets of DE miRNAs were also obtained, for which bioinformatics analyses were performed. Our results would be useful for investigating the functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in human influenza because pig serves as an excellent animal model to study the pathogenesis of human influenza.</jats:p>",0

The In-Feed Antibiotic Carbadox Induces Phage Gene Transcription in the Swine Gut Microbiome,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Carbadox is a quinoxaline-di-
            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>
            -oxide antibiotic fed to over 40% of young pigs in the United States that has been shown to induce phage DNA transduction
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            ; however, the effects of carbadox on swine microbiome functions are poorly understood. We investigated the
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            longitudinal effects of carbadox on swine gut microbial gene expression (fecal metatranscriptome) and phage population dynamics (fecal dsDNA viromes). Microbial metagenome, transcriptome, and virome sequences were annotated for taxonomic inference and gene function by using FIGfam (isofunctional homolog sequences) and SEED subsystems databases. When the beta diversities of microbial FIGfam annotations were compared, the control and carbadox communities were distinct 2 days after carbadox introduction. This effect was driven by carbadox-associated lower expression of FIGfams (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 66) related to microbial respiration, carbohydrate utilization, and RNA metabolism (
            <jats:italic>q</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.1), suggesting bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects within certain populations. Interestingly, carbadox treatment caused greater expression of FIGfams related to all stages of the phage lytic cycle 2 days following the introduction of carbadox (
            <jats:italic>q</jats:italic>
            ≤0.07), suggesting the carbadox-mediated induction of prophages and phage DNA recombination. These effects were diminished by 7 days of continuous carbadox in the feed, suggesting an acute impact. Additionally, the viromes included a few genes that encoded resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and beta-lactam antibiotics but these did not change in frequency over time or with treatment. The results show decreased bacterial growth and metabolism, prophage induction, and potential transduction of bacterial fitness genes in swine gut bacterial communities as a result of carbadox administration.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            FDA regulations on agricultural antibiotic use have focused on antibiotics that are important for human medicine. Carbadox is an antibiotic not used in humans but frequently used on U.S. pig farms. It is important to study possible side effects of carbadox use because it has been shown to promote bacterial evolution, which could indirectly impact antibiotic resistance in bacteria of clinical importance. Interestingly, the present study shows greater prophage gene expression in feces from carbadox-fed animals than in feces from nonmedicated animals 2 days after the initiation of in-feed carbadox treatment. Importantly, the phage genetic material isolated in this study contained genes that could provide resistance to antibiotics that are important in human medicine, indicating that human-relevant antibiotic resistance genes are mobile between bacteria via phages. This study highlights the collateral effects of antibiotics and demonstrates the need to consider diverse antibiotic effects whenever antibiotics are being used or new regulations are considered.

"Molecular identification and characterization of novel coronaviruses infecting graylag geese (Anser anser), feral pigeons (Columbia livia) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos)","<jats:p>In light of the finding of a previously unknown coronavirus as the aetiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it is probable that other coronaviruses, than those recognized to date, are circulating in animal populations. Here, the results of a screening for coronavirus are presented, using a universal coronavirus RT-PCR, of the bird species graylag goose (<jats:italic>Anser anser</jats:italic>), feral pigeon (<jats:italic>Columbia livia</jats:italic>) and mallard (<jats:italic>Anas platyrhynchos</jats:italic>). Coronaviruses were found in cloacal swab samples from all the three bird species. In the graylag goose, 40 of 163 sampled birds were coronavirus positive, whereas two of 100 sampled pigeons and one of five sampled mallards tested positive. The infected graylag geese showed lower body weights compared with virus-negative birds, suggesting clinical significance of the infection. Phylogenetic analyses performed on the replicase gene and nucleocapsid protein sequences, indicated that the novel coronaviruses described in the present study all branch off from group III coronaviruses. All the novel avian coronaviruses harboured the conserved s2m RNA structure in their 3′ untranslated region, like other previously described group III coronaviruses, and like the SARS coronavirus. Sequencing of the complete nucleocapsid gene and downstream regions of goose and pigeon coronaviruses, evidenced the presence of two additional open reading frames for the goose coronavirus with no sequence similarity to known proteins, but with predicted transmembrane domains for one of the encoded proteins, and one additional open reading frame for the pigeon coronavirus, with a predicted transmembrane domain, downstream of the nucleocapsid gene.</jats:p>",0

Based on our cladograms, we propose the existence of more than 12 monophyletic groups within the species BVDV 1. The mapping of clinical symptoms suggests that the emergence of some genotypes could have been driven by a change in the pathogenic process.<jats:italic>Enteric Problems</jats:italic>appear to be ancestral, while<jats:italic>Reproductive</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Respiratory Problems</jats:italic>arise with the emergence of genotypes<jats:italic>1b</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>1d</jats:italic>and the herein‐proposed genotype<jats:italic>Arg 1</jats:italic>. The distribution of contaminant strains on the cladograms shows that pestiviral contamination is a common process, and also suggests that a contaminated product might be a vehicle for virus dispersion.

            Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is a simple retrovirus that can cause hemangiomas and myeloid tumors in chickens and is currently a major economic problem in Asia. Here we characterize ALV-J strain PDRC-59831, a newly studied U.S. isolate of ALV-J. Five-day-old chicken embryos were infected with this virus, and the chickens developed myeloid leukosis and hemangiomas within 2 months after hatching. To investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis, we employed high-throughput sequencing to analyze proviral integration sites in these tumors. We found expanded clones with integrations in the

Partial sequence of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene of fowl adenoviruses: A reference panel for a general diagnostic PCR in poultry,"<jats:p>Adenoviruses are frequent infectious agents in different poultry species. The traditional, serological typing of new isolates by virus neutralisation tests is now in transition to be replaced by PCR and sequencing. The first PCRs, recommended for the detection of adenoviruses, had been designed to target the gene of the major capsid protein, the hexon. In birds, members of three different genera of the family<jats:italic>Adenoviridae</jats:italic>may occur. Accordingly, three specific hexon PCRs had to be elaborated for the detection of adenoviruses in poultry. A significantly more sensitive PCR, targeting the viral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene, has been described recently. This method proved to be an efficient alternative for the general detection of adenoviruses irrespective of their genus affiliation. Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs), isolated from chicken to date, comprise twelve serotypes classified into five virus species (FAdV-A to E). The polymerase gene sequence has been determined yet only from three FAdV types representing three species. In the present work, the panel of polymerase gene sequences was completed with those of the rest of FAdVs. The newly determined sequences will facilitate the identification of new FAdV isolates as an existing species or as a putative new FAdV. Once the polymerase sequence is known, more specific PCRs for the amplification of the hexon and other genes can be designed and performed according to the preliminary species classification.</jats:p>",0

The sequences were obtained by RT–PCR and 3′-RACE with primers based on the sequences of Talfan and available PEV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of RdRp/VP2 and analysis of the predicted RNA secondary structure of the 3′-NTR indicated that PEVs should be reclassified genetically into at least three groups, one that should be assigned to PTVs and two PEV subspecies represented by strain PEV-8 V13 and strain PEV-9 UKG410/73.</jats:p>",0

"Nucleotide sequence of avian carcinoma virus MH2: two potential onc genes, one related to avian virus MC29 and the other related to murine sarcoma virus 3611.","<jats:p>The 5.2-kilobase (kb) RNA genome of avian carcinoma virus MH2 has the genetic structure 5'-delta gag (0.2 kb)- mht (1.2 kb)-myc (1.4 kb)-c (0.4 kb)-poly(A) (0.2 kb)-3'. delta gag is a partial retroviral core protein gene, mht and myc are cell-derived MH2-specific sequences, and c is the 3'-terminal retroviral vector sequence. Here we have determined the nucleotide sequence of 3.5 kb from the 3' end of delta gag to the 3' end of molecularly cloned proviral MH2 DNA, in order to elucidate the genetic structure of the virus and to compare it with other mht - and myc-containing oncogenic viruses as well as with the chicken proto-myc gene. The following results were obtained: (i) delta gag- mht forms a hybrid gene with a contiguous reading frame of 2682 nucleotides that terminates with a stop codon near the 3' end of mht . The 3' 969 nucleotides of mht up to the stop codon are 80% sequence related to the onc-specific raf sequence of murine sarcoma virus 3611 (94% homologous at the deduced amino acid level). (ii) The myc sequence is preceded by an RNA splice acceptor site shared with the cellular proto-myc gene, beyond which it is colinear up to a 3'-termination codon and 40 noncoding nucleotides with the myc sequences of avian retrovirus MC29 and chicken proto-myc. Thus, myc forms, together with a 5' retroviral exon, a second MH2-specific gene. (iii) myc is followed by the 3'-terminal c region of about 400 nucleotides, which is colinear with that of Rous sarcoma virus except for a substitution near the 5' end of the long terminal repeat. It is concluded that MH2 contains two genes with oncogenic potential, the delta gag- mht gene, which is closely related to the delta gag-raf transforming gene of MSV 3611, and the myc gene, which is related to the transforming gene of MC29. Furthermore, it may be concluded that the cellular proto-onc genes, which on sequence transduction become viral onc genes, are a small group because among the 19 known onc sequences, 5 are shared by different taxonomic groups of viruses of which the mht /raf homology is the closest determined so far.</jats:p>",0
"Impact of Coxsackievirus A6 emergence on hand, foot, and mouth disease epidemic in Osaka City, Japan","<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute febrile illness characterized by fever; sore throat; and vesicular eruptions on the hands, feet, and oral mucosa. Until 2010, HFMD was predominantly associated with enterovirus (EV) A71 and coxsackievirus (CV) A16 in Japan. In 2011, CV‐A6 emerged as a primary causative agent, causing the largest HFMD epidemic in Japan since 1981. Since then, CV‐A6 has caused large HFMD epidemics every 2 years. The phylogenetic analysis of complete Viral Protein 1 (VP1) sequences revealed that most CV‐A6 strains detected from 2011 to 2015 in Osaka City were classified into a different clade compared with CV‐A6 strains detected from 1999 until 2009. The majority of CV‐A6 strains detected in 2011 and most CV‐A6 strains detected from 2013 to 2015 were mainly divided into two distinct genetic groups. Each epidemic strain carried unique amino acid substitutions in the presumed DE, EF, and GH loops of the VP1 protein that is exposed on the surface of the virion. There is a possibility that the appearance of substitutions on the surface of the virion and an accumulation of a susceptible population are significant factors in recent HFMD epidemics.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Reassortant swine influenza viruses isolated in Japan contain genes from pandemic A(H1N1) 2009,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>In 2013, three reassortant swine influenza viruses (SIVs)—two H1N2 and one H3N2—were isolated from symptomatic pigs in Japan; each contained genes from the pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 virus and endemic SIVs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two H1N2 viruses, A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 and A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013, were reassortants that contain genes from the following three distinct lineages: (i) H1 and nucleoprotein (NP) genes derived from a classical swine H1 HA lineage uniquely circulating among Japanese SIVs; (ii) neuraminidase (NA) genes from human‐like H1N2 swine viruses; and (iii) other genes from pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses. The H3N2 virus, A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013, comprised genes from two sources: (i) hemagglutinin (HA) and NA genes derived from human and human‐like H3N2 swine viruses and (ii) other genes from pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that each of the reassortants may have arisen independently in Japanese pigs. A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 were found to have strong antigenic reactivities with antisera generated for some seasonal human‐lineage viruses isolated during or before 2003, whereas A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 reactivities with antisera against viruses isolated after 2004 were clearly weaker. In addition, antisera against some strains of seasonal human‐lineage H1 viruses did not react with either A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 or A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013. These findings indicate that emergence and spread of these reassortant SIVs is a potential public health risk.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

            <jats:p>Virus subtype H13N2, A/mallard/Kr/SH38-45/2010 (H13N2), was first isolated from a mallard fecal sample in South Korea.</jats:p>

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Phylogenetic analysis of all eight viral genes revealed that this virus emerged by genetic mixing between Eurasian and North American gene pools, and possibly between wild ducks and gulls. The H13 and N2 surface genes clustered together in a group with Eurasian isolates from gulls and wild birds, respectively. The PB2, PA, NP, M and NS segments belonged to the Eurasian lineage, whereas the PB1 gene clustered in the North American lineage. Furthermore, they showed a bird-dependent pattern in phylogenetic analysis: the M gene was similar to subtype H13 viruses within gulls, whereas other segments were similar to avian influenza viruses of other subtypes from wild ducks.</jats:p>

            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The data suggests that the novel reassortant H13N2 virus isolated in South Korea might have emerged by genetic reassortment between intercontinental and interspecies transmission in wild birds.</jats:p>

Multiple novel astrovirus species in human stool,"<jats:p>Diarrhoea remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries where numerous cases remain without identified aetiology. Astroviruses are a recently identified cause of animal gastroenteritis which currently includes two species suspected of causing human diarrhoea. Using pan-astrovirus RT-PCR, we analysed human stool samples from different continents for astrovirus-related RNA sequences. We identified variants of the two known human astrovirus species plus, based on genetic distance criteria, three novel astrovirus species all distantly related to mink and ovine astroviruses, which we provisionally named HMOAstV species A–C. The complete genome of species A displayed all the conserved characteristics of mammalian astroviruses. Each of the now three groups of astroviruses found in human stool (HAstV, AstV-MLB and HMOAstV) were more closely related to animal astroviruses than to each other, indicating that human astroviruses may periodically emerge from zoonotic transmissions. Based on the pathogenic impact of their closest phylogenetic relatives in animals, further investigations of the role of HMOAstV, so far detected in Nigeria, Nepal and Pakistan, in human gastroenteritis are warranted.</jats:p>",0

Possible risks posed by single‐stranded <scp>DNA</scp> viruses of pigs associated with xenotransplantation,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Routine large‐scale xenotransplantation from pigs to humans is getting closer to clinical reality owing to several state‐of‐the‐art technologies, especially the ability to rapidly engineer genetically defined pigs. However, using pig organs in humans poses risks including unwanted cross‐species transfer of viruses and adaption of these pig viruses to the human organ recipient. Recent developments in the field of virology, including the advent of metagenomic techniques to characterize entire viromes, have led to the identification of a plethora of viruses in many niches. Single‐stranded <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DNA</jats:styled-content> (ss<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DNA</jats:styled-content>) viruses are the largest group prevalent in virome studies in mammals. Specifically, the ss<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DNA</jats:styled-content> viral genomes are characterized by a high rate of nucleotide substitution, which confers a proclivity to adapt to new hosts and cross‐species barriers. Pig‐associated ss<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DNA</jats:styled-content> viruses include torque teno sus viruses (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">TTS</jats:styled-content>uV) in the <jats:italic>Anelloviridae</jats:italic> family, porcine parvoviruses (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PPV</jats:styled-content>), and porcine bocaviruses (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PB</jats:styled-content>oV) both in the family of <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic>, and porcine circoviruses (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PCV</jats:styled-content>) in the <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic> family, some of which have been confirmed to be pathogenic to pigs. The risks of these viruses for the human recipient during xenotransplantation procedures are relatively unknown. Based on the scant knowledge available on the prevalence, predilection, and pathogenicity of pig‐associated ss<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">DNA</jats:styled-content> viruses, careful screening and monitoring are required. In the case of positive identification, risk assessments and strategies to eliminate these viruses in xenotransplantation pig stock may be needed.</jats:p>",0

Insights into the bovine rumen plasmidome,"<jats:p>Plasmids are self-replicating genetic elements capable of mobilization between different hosts. Plasmids often serve as mediators of lateral gene transfer, a process considered to be a strong and sculpting evolutionary force in microbial environments. Our aim was to characterize the overall plasmid population in the environment of the bovine rumen, which houses a complex and dense microbiota that holds enormous significance for humans. We developed a procedure for the isolation of total rumen plasmid DNA, termed rumen plasmidome, and subjected it to deep sequencing using the Illumina paired-end protocol and analysis using public and custom-made bioinformatics tools. A large number of plasmidome contigs aligned with plasmids of rumen bacteria isolated from different locations and at various time points, suggesting that not only the bacterial taxa, but also their plasmids, are defined by the ecological niche. The bacterial phylum distribution of the plasmidome was different from that of the rumen bacterial taxa. Nevertheless, both shared a dominance of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Evidently, the rumen plasmidome is of a highly mosaic nature that can cross phyla. Interestingly, when we compared the functional profile of the rumen plasmidome to two plasmid databases and two recently published rumen metagenomes, it became apparent that the rumen plasmidome codes for functions, which are enriched in the rumen ecological niche and could confer advantages to their hosts, suggesting that the functional profiles of mobile genetic elements are associated with their environment, as has been previously implied for viruses.</jats:p>",0

Genetic variability of porcine circovirus 2 in vaccinating and non-vaccinating commercial farms,"<jats:p>Vaccines against porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) are now widely used to control the diseases caused by the virus. Although the vaccines protect pigs against the disease, they do not lead to sterilizing immunity and therefore infections with PCV2 continue in farms. It is expected that, due to its high evolutionary rate, PCV2 can adapt quickly to environmental pressures such as vaccination. The goal of this study was to elucidate the molecular variation of PCV2 in relation to vaccination. PCV2 variability was investigated from samples of infected pigs from five farms where vaccination had never been applied and two farms where pigs had been vaccinated for at least 2 years. For the genetic analysis, full PCV2 genomes were amplified and subsequently pooled by vaccination status from serum of eight vaccinated, infected pigs and 16 non-vaccinated, infected pigs. Variability of viral populations was quantified using next-generation sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analysis. The number of segregating sites was similar in the non-vaccinated (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 109) and vaccinated pools (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 96), but the distribution of these sites in the genome differed. Most notably, in the capsid gene, the number of segregating sites was observed only in the non-vaccinated population. Based on the structural analysis, it is expected that some low-frequency amino acids result in biologically low-fit viruses. On the contrary, D294 in replicase represents a novel amino acid which was dominant and unique in the vaccinated pool. This work showed that variable PCV2 populations were circulating in commercial farms, and that this variability was different in samples obtained from vaccinating and non-vaccinating farms.</jats:p>",0

The microbiome of the soft palate of swine,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The tonsil of the soft palate in pigs is a secondary lymphoid tissue that provides a first line of defense against foreign antigens entering by the mouth or nares. It has been known for a long time to be the site of colonization of important swine and zoonotic bacterial pathogens. Initially our understanding of microbes present at this site came from culture-based studies. Very recently, sequence-based approaches have been used to identify the core microbiome of the swine tonsil. Although animal to animal and herd to herd variation was detected in these studies, &gt;90 of the organisms detected belonged to the phyla <jats:italic>Proteobacteria</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Firmicutes</jats:italic>.

Comparison of Schmallenberg virus sequences isolated from mammal host and arthropod vector,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Schmallenberg</jats:italic> virus (SBV) is the member of Peribunyaviridae family, which comprises pathogens of importance for human and veterinary medicine. The virus is transmitted only between animals and mainly by biting midges of the genus <jats:italic>Culicoides</jats:italic>. This study was performed in order to determine SBV genetic diversity and elucidate the host–vector adaptation. All three viral segments were analysed for sequence variability and phylogenetic relations. The Polish SBV strains obtained from acute infections of cattle, congenital cases in sheep, and from <jats:italic>Culicoides</jats:italic> midges were sequenced using Sanger and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. The obtained sequences were genetically similar (99.2–100% identity) to the first-detected strain BH80/11—4 from German cattle. The sampling year and origin of Polish sequences had no effect on molecular diversity of SBV. Considering all analysed Polish as well as European sequences, ovine-derived sequences were the most variable, while the midge ones were more conserved and encompassed unique substitutions located mainly in nonstructural protein S. SBV sequences isolated from <jats:italic>Culicoides</jats:italic> are the first submitted to GenBank and reported.</jats:p>",0

A Multicenter Study To Evaluate the Performance of High-Throughput Sequencing for Virus Detection,"<jats:p>Recent high-throughput sequencing (HTS) investigations have resulted in unexpected discoveries of known and novel viruses in a variety of sample types, including research materials, clinical materials, and biological products. Therefore, HTS can be a powerful tool for supplementing current methods for demonstrating the absence of adventitious or unwanted viruses in biological products, particularly when using a new cell line. However, HTS is a complex technology with different platforms, which needs standardization for evaluation of biologics. This collaborative study was undertaken to investigate detection of different virus types using two different HTS platforms. The results of the independently performed studies demonstrated a similar sensitivity of virus detection, regardless of the different sample preparation and processing procedures and bioinformatic analyses done in the three laboratories. Comparable HTS detection of different virus types supports future development of reference virus materials for standardization and validation of different HTS platforms.</jats:p>",0

Genetic variability in hepatitis B viruses,"<jats:p>In 1988, it was reported that the full nucleotide sequences of 18 hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains clustered into four genetic groups (A to D) with more than 8% divergence between the groups. This classification of strains in terms of genome sequence has since proven to be an important tool in the understanding of HBV epidemiology and evolution and has been expanded to include three more genotypes. In parallel with the HBV genotypes described in humans, HBV strains isolated from different primates and hepadnaviruses found in woodchucks, ground squirrels, ducks and herons have been studied. Sequence differences between HBV genotypes can lead to structural differences at the level of the pregenome and can also lead to dramatic differences at the translational level when specific and commonly occurring mutations occur. There is increasing evidence that the clinical picture, the response to treatment and the long-term prognosis may differ depending on which genotype has infected the patient. The consideration of traditional serological patterns in a patient must therefore take the genotype of the infecting strain into account. Nucleotide variability between HBV strains has been used in several studies to trace routes of transmission and, since it is becoming increasingly clear that the differences between HBV genotypes are important, the need for reliable and easy methods of differentiating HBV genotypes has arisen. This review summarizes the knowledge of HBV genotypes with regard to their genetic, structural and clinically significant differences and their origin and evolution in the context of the hepadnaviruses in general.</jats:p>",0

Predicting the global spread of H5N1 avian influenza,"<jats:p>The spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza into Asia, Europe, and Africa has resulted in enormous impacts on the poultry industry and presents an important threat to human health. The pathways by which the virus has and will spread between countries have been debated extensively, but have yet to be analyzed comprehensively and quantitatively. We integrated data on phylogenetic relationships of virus isolates, migratory bird movements, and trade in poultry and wild birds to determine the pathway for 52 individual introduction events into countries and predict future spread. We show that 9 of 21 of H5N1 introductions to countries in Asia were most likely through poultry, and 3 of 21 were most likely through migrating birds. In contrast, spread to most (20/23) countries in Europe was most likely through migratory birds. Spread in Africa was likely partly by poultry (2/8 introductions) and partly by migrating birds (3/8). Our analyses predict that H5N1 is more likely to be introduced into the Western Hemisphere through infected poultry and into the mainland United States by subsequent movement of migrating birds from neighboring countries, rather than from eastern Siberia. These results highlight the potential synergism between trade and wild animal movement in the emergence and pandemic spread of pathogens and demonstrate the value of predictive models for disease control.</jats:p>",0

Efficient Selection of Antibodies Reactive to Homologous Epitopes on Human and Mouse Hepatocyte Growth Factors by Next-Generation Sequencing-Based Analysis of the B Cell Repertoire,"<jats:p>YYB-101 is a humanized rabbit anti-human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-neutralizing antibody currently in clinical trial. To test the effect of HGF neutralization with antibody on anti-cancer T cell immunity, we generated surrogate antibodies that are reactive to the mouse homologue of the epitope targeted by YYB-101. First, we immunized a chicken with human HGF and monitored changes in the B cell repertoire by next-generation sequencing (NGS). We then extracted the VH gene repertoire from the NGS data, clustered it into components by sequence homology, and classified the components by the change in the number of unique VH sequences and the frequencies of the VH sequences within each component following immunization. Those changes should accompany the preferential proliferation and somatic hypermutation or gene conversion of B cells encoding HGF-reactive antibodies. One component showed significant increases in the number and frequencies of unique VH sequences and harbored genes encoding antibodies that were reactive to human HGF and competitive with YYB-101 for HGF binding. Some of the antibodies also reacted to mouse HGF. The selected VH sequences shared 98.3% identity and 98.9% amino acid similarity. It is therefore likely that the antibodies encoded by them all react to the epitope targeted by YYB-101.</jats:p>",0

Complete Genome Sequence of a Novel Newcastle Disease Virus Strain Isolated from a Chicken in West Africa,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The complete genome sequence of an African Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain isolated from a chicken in Togo in 2009 was determined. The genome is 15,198 nucleotides (nt) in length and is classified in genotype VII in the class II cluster. Compared to common vaccine strains, the African strain contains a previously described 6-nt insert in the downstream untranslated region of the N gene and a novel 6-nt insert in the HN-L intergenic region. Genome length differences are a marker of the natural history of NDV. This is the first description of a class II NDV strain with a genome of 15,198 nt and a 6-nt insert in the HN-L intergenic region. Sequence divergence relative to vaccine strains was substantial, likely contributes to outbreaks, and illustrates the continued evolution of new NDV strains in West Africa.</jats:p>",0

"Genetic clustering of Borna disease virus natural animal isolates, laboratory and vaccine strains strongly reflects their regional geographical origin","<jats:p>The aim of this study was to gain more detailed insights into the genetic evolution and variability of Borna disease virus (BDV). Phylogenetic analyses were performed on field viruses originating from naturally infected animals, the BDV vaccine strain ‘Dessau’, four widely used laboratory strains and the novel BDV subtype No/98. Four regions of the BDV genome were analysed: the complete p40, p10 and p24 genes and the 5′-untranslated region of the X/P transcript. BDV isolates from the same geographical area exhibited a clearly higher degree of identity to each other than to BDV isolates from other regions, independent of host species and year of isolation. Five different clusters could be established within endemic areas, corresponding to the geographical regions from which the viruses originated: (i) a Swiss, Austrian and Liechtenstein Rhine valley group, related closely to the geographically bordering Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria II group (ii) in the western part of Germany; (iii) a third group, called Bavaria I group, limited in occurrence to Bavaria; (iv) a southern Saxony-Anhalt and bordering northern Saxony group, bound to the territories of these federal states in the eastern part of Germany; and (v) a mixed group, consisting of samples from different areas of Germany; however, these were mainly from the federal states of Thuringia and Lower Saxony. The laboratory strains and the vaccine strain clustered within these groups according to their geographical origins. All field and laboratory strains, as well as the vaccine strain, clearly segregated from the recently described and highly divergent BDV strain No/98, which originated from an area in Austria where Borna disease is not endemic.</jats:p>",0

Deep Sequencing Analysis Reveals Temporal Microbiota Changes Associated with Development of Bovine Digital Dermatitis,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bovine digital dermatitis (DD) is a leading cause of lameness in dairy cattle throughout the world. Despite 35 years of research, the definitive etiologic agent associated with the disease process is still unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple bacterial species are associated with lesions, with spirochetes being the most reliably identified organism. This study details the deep sequencing-based metagenomic evaluation of 48 staged DD biopsy specimens collected during a 3-year longitudinal study of disease progression. Over 175 million sequences were evaluated by utilizing both shotgun and 16S metagenomic techniques. Based on the shotgun sequencing results, there was no evidence of a fungal or DNA viral etiology. The bacterial microbiota of biopsy specimens progresses through a systematic series of changes that correlate with the novel morphological lesion scoring system developed as part of this project. This scoring system was validated, as the microbiota of each stage was statistically significantly different from those of other stages (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>

Genomic Characterization of the Genus Nairovirus (Family Bunyaviridae),"<jats:p>Nairovirus, one of five bunyaviral genera, includes seven species. Genomic sequence information is limited for members of the Dera Ghazi Khan, Hughes, Qalyub, Sakhalin, and Thiafora nairovirus species. We used next-generation sequencing and historical virus-culture samples to determine 14 complete and nine coding-complete nairoviral genome sequences to further characterize these species. Previously unsequenced viruses include Abu Mina, Clo Mor, Great Saltee, Hughes, Raza, Sakhalin, Soldado, and Tillamook viruses. In addition, we present genomic sequence information on additional isolates of previously sequenced Avalon, Dugbe, Sapphire II, and Zirqa viruses. Finally, we identify Tunis virus, previously thought to be a phlebovirus, as an isolate of Abu Hammad virus. Phylogenetic analyses indicate the need for reassignment of Sapphire II virus to Dera Ghazi Khan nairovirus and reassignment of Hazara, Tofla, and Nairobi sheep disease viruses to novel species. We also propose new species for the Kasokero group (Kasokero, Leopards Hill, Yogue viruses), the Ketarah group (Gossas, Issyk-kul, Keterah/soft tick viruses) and the Burana group (Wēnzhōu tick virus, Huángpí tick virus 1, Tǎchéng tick virus 1). Our analyses emphasize the sister relationship of nairoviruses and arenaviruses, and indicate that several nairo-like viruses (Shāyáng spider virus 1, Xīnzhōu spider virus, Sānxiá water strider virus 1, South Bay virus, Wǔhàn millipede virus 2) require establishment of novel genera in a larger nairovirus-arenavirus supergroup.</jats:p>",0

Natural Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus Infection: Novel Pathologic Findings Resembling Other Morbillivirus Infections,"<jats:p> The present study describes pathologic and virologic findings in 15 sheep and 6 goats that died of natural peste des petits ruminants virus infection in Turkey. Pathologic findings included erosiveulcerative stomatitis, fibrino-necrotic tracheitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, multifocal coagulation necroses in the liver, and severe lymphocytolysis in lymphoid tissues. Syncytial cells were conspicuous, especially in the oral mucosa, pulmonary alveoli, liver, and lymphoid tissues. In addition to the typical tissue distribution, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic and/or intranuclear inclusions were observed in epithelial cells lining the renal pelvis and abomasal mucosa. Immunolabeling of the viral antigen was observed in the kidney, brain, rumen, abomasum, heart, and myocytes of the tongue besides its more typical locations. In this study, we report and describe in detail the first peste des petits ruminants endemic in Kirikkale Province, Central Anatolia of Turkey. In conclusion, these previously unreported pathologic findings in natural peste des petits ruminants virus infection establish a basis for resemblance to other morbillivirus infections, such as canine distemper and distemper of sea mammals. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that the 448-bp genome fragment was amplified in 18 cases (18/21, 85.7%). Phylogenetic analysis showed that viruses belong to lineage 4 in the peste des petits ruminants virus common phylogenetic tree. </jats:p>",0

Muscovy duck reovirus σC protein is atypically encoded by the smallest genome segment,"<jats:p>Although muscovy duck reovirus (DRV) shares properties with the reovirus isolated from chicken, commonly named avian reovirus (ARV), the two virus species are antigenically different. Similar to the DRV σB-encoded gene (1201 bp long) previously identified, the three other double-stranded RNA small genome segments of DRV have been cloned and sequenced. They were 1325, 1191 and 1124 bp long, respectively, and contained conserved terminal sequences common to ARVs. They coded for single expression products, except the smallest (S4), which contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). BLAST analyses revealed that the proteins encoded by the 1325 and 1191 bp genes shared high identity levels with ARV σA and σNS, respectively, and to a lesser extent with other orthoreovirus counterparts. No homology was found for the S4 ORF1-encoded p10 protein. The 29·4 kDa product encoded by S4 ORF2 appeared to be 25% identical to ARV S1 ORF3-encoded σC, a cell-attachment oligomer inducing type-specific neutralizing antibodies. Introduction of large gaps in the N-terminal part of the DRV protein was necessary to improve DRV and ARV σC amino acid sequence alignments. However, a leucine zipper motif was conserved and secondary structure analyses predicted a three-stranded α-helical coiled-coil feature at this amino portion. Thus, despite extensive sequence divergence, DRV σC was suggested to be structurally and probably functionally related to ARV σC. This work provides evidence for the diversity of the polycistronic S class genes of reoviruses isolated from birds and raises the question of the relative classification of DRV in the <jats:italic>Orthoreovirus</jats:italic> genus.</jats:p>",0

Virological Surveillance and Preliminary Antigenic Characterization of Influenza Viruses in Pigs in Five European Countries from 2006 to 2008,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>This study presents the results of the virological surveillance for swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in Belgium, UK, Italy, France and Spain from 2006 to 2008. Our major aims were to clarify the occurrence of the three SIV subtypes – H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 – at regional levels, to identify novel reassortant viruses and to antigenically compare SIVs with human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. Lung tissue and/or nasal swabs from outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in pigs were investigated by virus isolation. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were determined using standard methods. Of the total 169 viruses, 81 were classified as ‘avian‐like’ H1N1, 36 as human‐like H3N2 and 47 as human‐like H1N2. Only five novel reassortant viruses were identified: two H1N1 viruses had a human‐like HA and three H1N2 viruses an avian‐like HA. All three SIV subtypes were detected in Belgium, Italy and Spain, while only H1N1 and H1N2 viruses were found in UK and Northwestern France. Cross‐hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests with hyperimmune sera against selected older and recent human influenza viruses showed a strong antigenic relationship between human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from the 1980s and H1N2 and H3N2 human‐like SIVs, confirming their common origin. However, antisera against human viruses isolated during the last decade did not react with currently circulating H1 or H3 SIVs, suggesting that especially young people may be, to some degree, susceptible to SIV infections.</jats:p>",0
"Genomic and phylogenetic characterization of viruses included in the Manzanilla and Oropouche species complexes of the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae","<jats:p>A thorough characterization of the genetic diversity of viruses present in vector and vertebrate host populations is essential for the early detection of and response to emerging pathogenic viruses, yet genetic characterization of many important viral groups remains incomplete. The Simbu serogroup of the genus <jats:italic>Orthobunyavirus</jats:italic>, family <jats:italic>Bunyaviridae</jats:italic>, is an example. The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a highly diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock species. Here, we report complete genome sequences for 11 viruses within this group, with a focus on the large and poorly characterized Manzanilla and Oropouche species complexes. Phylogenetic and pairwise divergence analyses indicated the presence of high levels of genetic diversity within these two species complexes, on a par with that seen among the five other species complexes in the Simbu serogroup. Based on previously reported divergence thresholds between species, the data suggested that these two complexes should actually be divided into at least five species. Together these five species formed a distinct phylogenetic clade apart from the rest of the Simbu serogroup. Pairwise sequence divergences among viruses of this clade and viruses in other Simbu serogroup species complexes were similar to levels of divergence among the other orthobunyavirus serogroups. The genetic data also suggested relatively high levels of natural reassortment, with three potential reassortment events present, including two well-supported events involving viruses known to infect humans.</jats:p>",0
Diversity of viruses detected by deep sequencing in pigs from a common background,"<jats:p> Although advances in nucleic acid sequencing have enabled the discovery of many infectious agents, challenges remain for scientists and veterinary diagnosticians trying to design animal studies with a minimum of variables and to interpret laboratory results. To evaluate pyrosequencing technology as a potential screening method to estimate the virome in pigs, fecal samples were collected from 4 pigs out of a group of 175 that had been raised together since birth. A number of viruses were detected, demonstrating the application of this technology to determine the background “noise” in the pigs. However, pyrosequencing also demonstrated the diversity of viruses within a group of animals and how that can confound experimental design and obscure a definitive diagnosis. </jats:p>",0

Three novel canine papillomaviruses support taxonomic clade formation,"<jats:p>More than 100 human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been identified and had their whole genomes sequenced. Most of these HPVs can be classified into three distinct genera, the alpha-, beta- and gamma-papillomaviruses (PVs). Of note, only one or a small number of PVs have been identified for each individual animal species. However, four canine PVs (CPVs) (COPV, CPV2, CPV3 and CPV4) have been described and their entire genomic sequences have been published. Based on their sequence similarities, they belong to three distinct clades. In the present study, circular viral DNA was amplified from three dogs showing signs of pigmented plaques, endophytic papilloma or<jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>squamous cell carcinoma. Analysis of the DNA sequences suggested that these are three novel viruses (CPV5, CPV6 and CPV7) whose genomes comprise all the conserved sequence elements of known PVs. The genomes of these seven CPVs were compared in order properly classify them. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses, as well as pairwise sequence alignments of the putative amino acid sequences, revealed that CPV5 grouped well with CPV3 and CPV4, whereas CPV7 grouped with CPV2 but neither group fitted with other classified PVs. However, CPV6 grouped with COPV, a lambda-PV. Based on this evidence, allocation of CPVs into three distinct clades could therefore be supported. Thus, similar to HPVs, it might be that the known and currently unknown CPVs are related and form just a few clades or genera.</jats:p>",0

Blood transcriptomes reveal novel parasitic zoonoses circulating in Madagascar's lemurs,"<jats:p>
            Zoonotic diseases are a looming threat to global populations, and nearly 75% of emerging infectious diseases can spread among wildlife, domestic animals and humans. A ‘One World, One Health’ perspective offers us an ideal framework for understanding and potentially mitigating the spread of zoonoses, and the island of Madagascar serves as a natural laboratory for conducting these studies. Rapid habitat degradation and climate change on the island are contributing to more frequent contact among humans, livestock and wildlife, increasing the potential for pathogen spillover events. Given Madagascar's long geographical isolation, coupled with recent and repeated introduction of agricultural and invasive species, it is likely that a number of circulating pathogens remain uncharacterized in lemur populations. Thus, it is imperative that new approaches be implemented for de novo pathogen discovery. To this end, we used non-targeted deep sequencing of blood transcriptomes from two species of critically endangered wild lemurs (
            <jats:italic>Indri indri</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Propithecus diadema</jats:italic>
            ) to characterize blood-borne pathogens. Our results show several undescribed vector-borne parasites circulating within lemurs, some of which may cause disease in wildlife, livestock and humans. We anticipate that advanced methods for de novo identification of unknown pathogens will have broad utility for characterizing other complex disease transmission systems.

Characterization of a New Potyvirus Naturally Infecting Chickpea,"<jats:p> During the 1999 to 2001 growing seasons, symptoms consisting of mosaic, stunting, yellowing, wilting, shortening of internodes, and phloem discoloration were observed in chickpea (Cicer arietinum) grown in the Department of Chuquisaca in southern Bolivia. In some fields, approximately 10% of the plants exhibited viruslike symptoms and suffered greatly reduced seed yields. Lentil (Lens culinaris) was also observed to be infected but not pea (Pisum sativum) or faba bean (Vicia faba) growing in nearby fields. Infected chickpea tissue reacted positively to the potyvirus group-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), but there was no serological reaction with antisera to the potyviruses Bean yellow mosaic virus, Clover yellow vein virus, Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus, Pea seedborne mosaic virus, Bean common mosaic virus, or Bean common mosaic necrosis virus. Western blots of total protein extracts probed with the potyvirus MAb revealed a single band ca. 32 kDa. Comparative sequence analysis of cDNA clones generated from the putative coat protein gene consisted of 282 amino acids (31.9 kDa) and showed moderate identities of 67, 66, 63, 63, and 61% with the coat proteins of potyviruses Pepper severe mosaic virus, Pepper yellow mosaic virus, Potato virus Y, Plum pox virus, and Pepper mottle virus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the coat protein amino acid sequence revealed that this virus is a unique member of the family Potyviridae and is phylogenetically most closely related to a group of Solanaceae-infecting potyviruses rather than to other legumeinfecting potyviruses. The proposed name for the new causal agent is Chickpea yellow mosaic virus. </jats:p>",0

Discovery and Sequence Analysis of Four Deltacoronaviruses from Birds in the Middle East Reveal Interspecies Jumping with Recombination as a Potential Mechanism for Avian-to-Avian and Avian-to-Mammalian Transmission,"<jats:p>During an attempt to explore the diversity of deltacoronaviruses among mammals and birds in Dubai, four novel deltacoronaviruses were detected in fecal samples from eight birds of four different species: FalCoV UAE-HKU27 from a falcon, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 from a houbara bustard, PiCoV UAE-HKU29 from a pigeon, and QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 from five quails. Genome analysis revealed evidence of recent interspecies transmission between falcons and their prey, houbara bustards and pigeons, possibly along the food chain, as well as avian-to-swine transmission. Recombination, which is known to occur frequently in some coronaviruses, was also common among these deltacoronaviruses and occurred predominantly at the spike region. Such recombination, involving the receptor binding protein, may contribute to the emergence of new viruses capable of infecting new hosts. Birds in the Middle East are hosts for diverse deltacoronaviruses with potential for interspecies transmission.</jats:p>",0
Chickens host diverse picornaviruses originated from potential interspecies transmission with recombination,"<jats:p>While chickens are an important reservoir for emerging pathogens such as avian influenza viruses, little is known about the diversity of picornaviruses in poultry. We discovered a previously unknown diversity of picornaviruses in chickens in Hong Kong. Picornaviruses were detected in 87 cloacal and 7 tracheal samples from 93 of 900 chickens by reverse transcription-PCR, with their partial 3D<jats:sup>pol</jats:sup> gene sequences forming five distinct clades (I to V) among known picornaviruses. Analysis of eight genomes from different clades revealed seven different picornaviruses, including six novel picornavirus species (ChPV1 from clade I, ChPV2 and ChPV3 from clade II, ChPV4 and ChPV5 from clade III, ChGV1 from clade IV) and one existing species (<jats:italic>Avian encephalomyelitis virus</jats:italic> from clade V). The six novel chicken picornavirus genomes exhibited distinct phylogenetic positions and genome features different from related picornaviruses, supporting their classification as separate species. Moreover, ChPV1 may potentially belong to a novel genus, with low sequence homologies to related picornaviruses, especially in the P1 and P2 regions, including the predicted L and 2A proteins. Nevertheless, these novel picornaviruses were most closely related to picornaviruses of other avian species (ChPV1 related to <jats:italic>Passerivirus</jats:italic> 
                  <jats:italic>A</jats:italic>, ChPV2 and ChPV3 to <jats:italic>Avisivirus A</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Duck hepatitis A virus</jats:italic>, ChPV4 and ChPV5 to <jats:italic>Melegrivirus</jats:italic> A, ChGV1 to <jats:italic>Gallivirus A</jats:italic>). Furthermore, ChPV5 represented a potential recombinant picornavirus, with its P2 and P3 regions possibly originating from <jats:italic>Melegrivirus A</jats:italic>. Chickens are an important reservoir for diverse picornaviruses that may cross avian species barriers through mutation or recombination.</jats:p>",0

While recent studies demonstrated the importance of the nonstructural protein NSs as a major component of virulence in vertebrates, little is known about infection of mosquito vectors. Here we studied RVFV infection in three different mosquito cell lines, Aag2 cells from
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Aedes aegypti</jats:named-content>
            and U4.4 and C6/36 cells from
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Aedes albopictus</jats:named-content>
            . In contrast with mammalian cells, where NSs forms nuclear filaments, U4.4 and Aag2 cells downregulated NSs expression such that NSs filaments were never formed in nuclei of U4.4 cells and disappeared at an early time postinfection in the case of Aag2 cells. On the contrary, in C6/36 cells, NSs nuclear filaments were visible during the entire time course of infection. Analysis of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) by deep sequencing indicated that production of viRNAs was very low in C6/36 cells, which are known to be Dicer-2 deficient but expressed some viRNAs presenting a Piwi signature. In contrast, Aag2 and U4.4 cells produced large amounts of viRNAs predominantly matching the S segment and displaying Dicer-2 and Piwi signatures. Whereas 21-nucleotide (nt) Dicer-2 viRNAs were prominent during early infection, the population of 24- to 27-nt Piwi RNAs (piRNAs) increased progressively and became predominant later during the acute infection and during persistence. In Aag2 and U4.4 cells, the combined actions of the Dicer-2 and Piwi pathways triggered an efficient antiviral response permitting, among other actions, suppression of NSs filament formation and allowing establishment of persistence. In C6/36 cells, Piwi-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) appeared to be sufficient to mount an antiviral response against a secondary infection with a superinfecting virus. This study provides new insights into the role of Dicer and Piwi in mosquito antiviral defense and the development of the antiviral response in mosquitoes.

Nucleotide sequence analysis and expression from recombinant vectors demonstrate that the attachment protein G of bovine respiratory syncytial virus is distinct from that of human respiratory syncytial virus,"<jats:p>Bovine respiratory syncytial (BRS) virus causes a severe lower respiratory tract disease in calves similar to the disease in children caused by human respiratory syncytial (HRS) virus. While there is antigenic cross-reactivity among the other major viral structural proteins, the major glycoprotein, G, of BRS virus and that of HRS virus are antigenically distinct. The G glycoprotein has been implicated as the attachment protein for HRS virus. We have carried out a molecular comparison of the glycoprotein G of BRS virus with the HRS virus counterparts. cDNA clones corresponding to the BRS virus G glycoprotein mRNA were isolated and analyzed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The BRS virus G mRNA contained 838 nucleotides exclusive of poly(A) and had a major open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 257 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the BRS virus G polypeptide showed only 29 to 30% amino acid identity with the G protein of either the subgroup A or B HRS virus. However, despite this low level of identity, there were strong similarities in the predicted hydropathy profiles of the BRS virus and HRS virus G proteins. A cDNA molecule containing the complete BRS virus G major open reading frame was inserted into the thymidine kinase gene of vaccinia virus by homologous recombination, and a recombinant virus containing the BRS virus G protein gene was isolated. This recombinant virus expressed the BRS virus G protein, as demonstrated by Western immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence of infected cells. The BRS virus G protein expressed from the recombinant vector was transported to and expressed on the surface of infected cells. Antisera to the BRS virus G protein made by using the recombinant vector to immunize animals recognized the BRS virus attachment protein but not the HRS virus G protein and vice versa, confirming the lack of antigenic cross-reactivity between the BRS and HRS virus attachment proteins. On the basis of the data presented here, we conclude that BRS virus should be classified within the genus Pneumovirus in a group separate from HRS virus and that it is no more closely related to HRS virus subgroup A than it is to HRS virus subgroup B.</jats:p>",0

"Origin, Genetic Diversity, and Evolutionary Dynamics of Novel Porcine Circovirus 3","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) is a novel virus associated with acute PDNS (porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome)‐like clinical signs identified by metagenomic sequencing from swine. Its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes resulting in the emergence and spread of PCV3 remain poorly understood. Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single‐stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.</jats:p>",0

"Avian Influenza Virus Subtype H9N2 Affects Intestinal Microbiota, Barrier Structure Injury, and Inflammatory Intestinal Disease in the Chicken Ileum","<jats:p>Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 (H9N2 AIV) has caused significant losses to the poultry industry due to the high mortality associated with secondary infections attributable to E. coli. This study tries to address the underlying secondary mechanisms after H9N2 AIV infection. Initially, nine day-old specific pathogen-free chickens were assigned to control (uninfected) and H9N2-infected groups, respectively. Using Illumina sequencing, histological examination, and quantitative real-time PCR, it was found that H9N2 AIV caused intestinal microbiota disorder, injury, and inflammatory damage to the intestinal mucosa. Notably, the genera Escherichia, especially E. coli, significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) at five days post-infection (dpi), while Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and other probiotic organisms were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01). Simultaneously, the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin 3, and occludin), TFF2, and Muc2 were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01), indicating the destruction of the intestinal epithelial cell tight junctions and the damage of mucin layer construction. Moreover, the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-22, IFN-α, and IL-17A in intestinal epithelial cells were significantly upregulated, resulting in the inflammatory response and intestinal injury. Our findings may provide a theoretical basis for observed gastroenteritis-like symptoms such as diarrhea and secondary E. coli infection following H9N2 AIV infection.</jats:p>",0

Faecal shedding of rotavirus vaccine in Chinese children after vaccination with Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine (LLR) is an oral live attenuated vaccine first licensed in China in 2000. To date, &gt; 60 million doses of LLR have been distributed to children. However, very little is known about faecal shedding of LLR in children. Therefore, faecal samples (n = 1,184) were collected from 114 children for 15 days post-vaccination in September–November 2011/2012. Faecal shedding and viral loads were determined by an enzyme immunoassay kit (EIA) and real-time RT-PCR. The complete genome was sequenced and the vaccine strain was isolated by culture in MA104 cells. Approximately 14.0% (16/114) of children had rotavirus-positive samples by EIA for at least 1 day post-vaccination. Viral loads in EIA-positive samples ranged from &lt; 1.0 × 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> to 1.9 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> copies/g. Faecal shedding occurred as early as post-vaccination day 2 and as late as post-vaccination day 13 and peaked on post-vaccination day 5–10. One LLR strain was isolated by culture in MA104 cells. Sequence analysis showed 99% identity with LLR prototype strain. Faecal shedding of LLR in stool is common within 15 days of LLR vaccination, indicating vaccine strains can replicate in human enteric tissues.</jats:p>",0

Multiple Diverse Circoviruses Infect Farm Animals and Are Commonly Found in Human and Chimpanzee Feces,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Circoviruses are known to infect birds and pigs and can cause a wide range of severe symptoms with significant economic impact. Using viral metagenomics, we identified circovirus-like DNA sequences and characterized 15 circular viral DNA genomes in stool samples from humans in Pakistan, Nigeria, Tunisia, and the United States and from wild chimpanzees. Distinct genomic features and phylogenetic analysis indicate that some viral genomes were part of a previously unrecognized genus in the
            <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>
            family we tentatively named “
            <jats:italic>Cyclovirus</jats:italic>
            ” whose genetic diversity is comparable to that of all the known species in the
            <jats:italic>Circovirus</jats:italic>
            genus.
            <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>
            detection in the stools of U.S. adults was limited to porcine circoviruses which were also found in most U.S. pork products. To determine whether the divergent cycloviruses found in non-U.S. human stools were of dietary origin, we genetically compared them to the cycloviruses in muscle tissue samples of commonly eaten farm animals in Pakistan and Nigeria. Limited genetic overlap between cycloviruses in human stool samples and local cow, goat, sheep, camel, and chicken meat samples indicated that the majority of the 25
            <jats:italic>Cyclovirus</jats:italic>
            species identified might be human viruses. We show that the genetic diversity of small circular DNA viral genomes in various mammals, including humans, is significantly larger than previously recognized, and frequent exposure through meat consumption and contact with animal or human feces provides ample opportunities for cyclovirus transmission. Determining the role of cycloviruses, found in 7 to 17% of non-U.S. human stools and 3 to 55% of non-U.S. meat samples tested, in both human and animal diseases is now facilitated by knowledge of their genomes.

Bat Guano Virome: Predominance of Dietary Viruses from Insects and Plants plus Novel Mammalian Viruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bats are hosts to a variety of viruses capable of zoonotic transmissions. Because of increased contact between bats, humans, and other animal species, the possibility exists for further cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks. We describe here full and partial viral genomes identified using metagenomics in the guano of bats from California and Texas. A total of 34% and 58% of 390,000 sequence reads from bat guano in California and Texas, respectively, were related to eukaryotic viruses, and the largest proportion of those infect insects, reflecting the diet of these insectivorous bats, including members of the viral families
            <jats:italic>Dicistroviridae</jats:italic>
            ,
            <jats:italic>Iflaviridae</jats:italic>

            , and
            <jats:italic>Nodaviridae</jats:italic>
            and the subfamily
            <jats:italic>Densovirinae</jats:italic>
            . The second largest proportion of virus-related sequences infects plants and fungi, likely reflecting the diet of ingested insects, including members of the viral families
            <jats:italic>Luteoviridae</jats:italic>
            ,
            <jats:italic>Secoviridae</jats:italic>

            and the genus
            <jats:italic>Sobemovirus</jats:italic>
            . Bat guano viruses related to those infecting mammals comprised the third largest group, including members of the viral families
            <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic>
            ,

            , and
            <jats:italic>Coronaviridae</jats:italic>
            . No close relative of known human viral pathogens was identified in these bat populations. Phylogenetic analysis was used to clarify the relationship to known viral taxa of novel sequences detected in bat guano samples, showing that some guano viral sequences fall outside existing taxonomic groups. This initial characterization of the bat guano virome, the first metagenomic analysis of viruses in wild mammals using second-generation sequencing, therefore showed the presence of previously unidentified viral species, genera, and possibly families. Viral metagenomics is a useful tool for genetically characterizing viruses present in animals with the known capability of direct or indirect viral zoonosis to humans.

A novel bocavirus in canine liver,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Bocaviruses are classified as a genus within the <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic> family of single-stranded DNA viruses and are pathogenic in some mammalian species. Two species have been previously reported in dogs, minute virus of canines (MVC), associated with neonatal diseases and fertility disorders; and Canine bocavirus (CBoV), associated with respiratory disease.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>
            <jats:p>In this study using deep sequencing of enriched viral particles from the liver of a dog with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, necrotizing vasculitis, granulomatous lymphadenitis and anuric renal failure, we identified and characterized a novel bocavirus we named Canine bocavirus 3 (CnBoV3). The three major ORFs of CnBoV3 (NS1, NP1 and VP1) shared less than 60% aa identity with those of other bocaviruses qualifying it as a novel species based on ICTV criteria. Inverse PCR showed the presence of concatemerized or circular forms of the genome in liver.</jats:p>

Viruses in diarrhoeic dogs include novel kobuviruses and sapoviruses,"<jats:p>The close interactions of dogs with humans and surrounding wildlife provide frequent opportunities for cross-species virus transmissions. In order to initiate an unbiased characterization of the eukaryotic viruses in the gut of dogs, this study used deep sequencing of partially purified viral capsid-protected nucleic acids from the faeces of 18 diarrhoeic dogs. Known canine parvoviruses, coronaviruses and rotaviruses were identified, and the genomes of the first reported canine kobuvirus and sapovirus were characterized. Canine kobuvirus, the first sequenced canine picornavirus and the closest genetic relative of the diarrhoea-causing human Aichi virus, was detected at high frequency in the faeces of both healthy and diarrhoeic dogs. Canine sapovirus constituted a novel genogroup within the genus<jats:italic>Sapovirus</jats:italic>, a group of viruses also associated with human and animal diarrhoea. These results highlight the high frequency of new virus detection possible even in extensively studied animal species using metagenomics approaches, and provide viral genomes for further disease-association studies.</jats:p>",0

MicroRNA-23b Promotes Avian Leukosis Virus Subgroup J (ALV-J) Replication by Targeting IRF1,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) can cause several different leukemia-like proliferative diseases in the hemopoietic system of chickens. Here, we investigated the transcriptome profiles and miRNA expression profiles of ALV-J-infected and uninfected chicken spleens to identify the genes and miRNAs related to ALV-J invasion. In total, 252 genes and 167 miRNAs were differentially expressed in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to control uninfected spleens. miR-23b expression was up-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared with the control spleens and transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (<jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic>) was down-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to uninfected spleens. A dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic> was a direct target of miR-23b. miR-23b overexpression significantly (P = 0.0022) decreased <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic> mRNA levels and repressed IRF1-3′-UTR reporter activity. <jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic> experiments revealed that miR-23b overexpression strengthened ALV-J replication, whereas miR-23b loss of function inhibited ALV-J replication. <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic> overexpression inhibited ALV-J replication and <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic> knockdown enhanced ALV-J replication. Moreover, <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic> overexpression significantly (P = 0.0014) increased <jats:italic>IFN-β</jats:italic> expression. In conclusion, these results suggested that miR-23b may play an important role in ALV-J replication by targeting <jats:italic>IRF1</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",0
MicroRNAs in the immune organs of chickens and ducks indicate divergence of immunity against H5N1 avian influenza,"<jats:p>Chickens are susceptible to the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus (HPAIV), whereas ducks are not. Here, we used high‐throughput sequencing to analyse the microRNA expression in the spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius of H5N1‐HPAIV‐infected and non‐infected chickens and ducks. We annotated the genomic positions of duck microRNAs and we compared the microRNA repertoires of chickens and ducks. Our results showed that the microRNA expression patterns in the homologous immune organs of specific‐pathogen‐free (SPF) chickens and ducks diverge substantially. Moreover, there was larger divergence between the microRNA expression patterns in immune organs of HPAIV‐infected chickens than HPAIV‐infected ducks. Together, our results might help to elucidate the roles of microRNAs in the divergent immunity of chickens and ducks against H5N1 HPAIV.</jats:p>",0

Evidence from nature: interspecies spread of heron hepatitis B viruses,"<jats:p>Heron hepatitis B viruses (HHBVs) in three subspecies of free-living great blue herons (<jats:italic>Ardea herodias</jats:italic>) from Florida, USA, were identified and characterized. Eight of 13 samples were positive in all assays used, whereas sera from egrets, which are also members of the family Ardeidae, were negative in the same assays. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of viral DNA sequences from the preS/S region of previously reported and novel HHBV strains isolated from captive grey herons (Germany) and free-ranging great blue herons (USA), respectively, revealed a strong conservation (95 % sequence similarity) with two separate clusters, implying a common ancestor of all strains. Our data demonstrate for the first time that different subspecies of herons are infected by HHBV and that these infections exist in non-captive birds. Phylogenetic analysis and the fact that the different heron species are geographically isolated populations suggest that lateral transmission, virus adaptation and environmental factors all play a role in HHBV spreading and evolution.</jats:p>",0

"Hypothesis On The Source, Transmission and Characteristics of Infection of Avian Influenza A (H7N9) Virus – Based On Analysis of Field Epidemiological Investigation and Gene Sequence Analysis","<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>On 31 March 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission announced that human infections with influenza A (H7N9) virus had occurred in Shanghai and Anhui provinces, China. H7N9 cases were later detected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It was estimated that the virus first spread northward along the route taken by migratory birds and then spread to neighbouring provinces with the sale of poultry. Epidemiological studies were carried out on samples from the external environment of infected cases, transmission routes, farmers markets and live poultry markets. Phylogenetic study of viral sequences from human and avian infections in Zhejiang showed that those from Shanghai and Jiangsu provinces along Taihu Lake were highly homologous with those from the external environment. This suggests that avian viruses carried by waterfowl combined with the virus carried by migratory birds, giving rise to avian influenza virus H7N9, which is highly pathogenic to humans. It is possible that the virus was transmitted by local wildfowl to domestic poultry and then to humans, or spread further by means of trading in wholesale poultry markets. As the weather has turned warm, and with measures adopted to terminate poultry trade and facilitate health communication, the epidemic in the first half of the year has been kept under control. However, the infection source in the triangular area around Taihu Lake still remains. The H7N9 epidemic will probably hit the area later in the year and next spring when the migratory birds return and may even spread to other areas. Great importance should therefore be attached to the wildfowl in Taihu Lake as the repository and disseminator of the virus: investigation and study of this population is essential.</jats:p>",0

SFTS virus (SFTSV) has been identified as the causative agent of the disease and has been recognized as a public health threat. This novel <jats:italic>Bunyavirus</jats:italic> belongs to the <jats:italic>Phlebovirus</jats:italic> genus in the family <jats:italic>Bunyaviridae</jats:italic>. This review also describes the different aspects of virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms on the basis of the published article surveillance data and phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences of large, medium, and small segments retrieved from database using <jats:sc>mega</jats:sc> 5.05, <jats:sc>simplot</jats:sc> 3.5.1, <jats:sc>network</jats:sc> 4.611, and <jats:sc>epi</jats:sc> information system 3.5.3 software. SFTS presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and considerable changes in several serum biomarkers. The disease has 10 ~ 15% mortality rate, commonly because of multiorgan dysfunction. SFTSV is mainly reported in the rural areas of Central and North‐Eastern China, with seasonal occurrence from May to September, mainly targeting those of ≥50 years of age. A wide range of domesticated animals, including sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, dogs, and chickens have been proven seropositive for SFTSV. Ticks, especially <jats:italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</jats:italic>, are suspected to be the potential vector, which have a broad animal host range in the world. More studies are needed to elucidate the vector–animal–human ecological cycle, the pathogenic mechanisms in high level animal models and vaccine development. © 2013 The Authors.

            <jats:p>Most of the strains were isolated during the period of 2008 to 2010 from Guangdong and Shandong provinces, China. Based on the phylogenetic and genotypic analyses, all of the H1N1 SIV strains can be classified into 8 lineages and 10 genotypes. All strains were of the characteristics of low pathogenic influenza viruses. The viruses of different lineage are characterized with different amino acid residues at the receptor-binding sites.

Origin and evolution of Nipah virus,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Nipah virus, member of the <jats:italic>Paramyxoviridae</jats:italic> family, is classified as a Biosafety Level‐4 agent and category C priority pathogen. Nipah virus disease is endemic in south Asia and outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia, Singapore, India, and Bangladesh. Bats of the genus <jats:italic>Pteropus</jats:italic> appear to be the natural reservoir of this virus. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of Nipah virus, to estimate the date of origin and the spread of the infection. The mean value of Nipah virus N gene evolutionary rate, was 6.5 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> substitution/site/year (95% HPD: 2.3 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup>–1.18 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>). The time‐scaled phylogenetic analysis showed that the root of the tree originated in 1947 (95% HPD: 1888–1988) as the virus entered in south eastern Asiatic regions. The segregation of sequences in two main clades (I and II) indicating that Nipah virus had two different introductions: one in 1995 (95% HPD: 1985–2002) which correspond to clade I, and the other in 1985 (95% HPD: 1971–1996) which correspond to clade II. The phylogeographic reconstruction indicated that the epidemic followed two different routes spreading to the other locations. The trade of infected pigs may have played a role in the spread of the virus. Bats of the Pteropus genus, that are able to travel to long distances, may have contributed to the spread of the infection. Negatively selected sites, statistically supported, could reflect the stability of the viral N protein. <jats:bold><jats:italic>J. Med.

"Bacteria, phages and pigs: the effects of in-feed antibiotics on the microbiome at different gut locations","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Disturbance of the beneficial gut microbial community is a potential collateral effect of antibiotics, which have many uses in animal agriculture (disease treatment or prevention and feed efficiency improvement). Understanding antibiotic effects on bacterial communities at different intestinal locations is essential to realize the full benefits and consequences of in-feed antibiotics. In this study, we defined the lumenal and mucosal bacterial communities from the small intestine (ileum) and large intestine (cecum and colon) plus feces, and characterized the effects of in-feed antibiotics (chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine and penicillin (ASP250)) on these communities. 16S rRNA gene sequence and metagenomic analyses of bacterial membership and functions revealed dramatic differences between small and large intestinal locations, including enrichment of Firmicutes and phage-encoding genes in the ileum. The large intestinal microbiota encoded numerous genes to degrade plant cell wall components, and these genes were lacking in the ileum. The mucosa-associated ileal microbiota harbored greater bacterial diversity than the lumen but similar membership to the mucosa of the large intestine, suggesting that most gut microbes can associate with the mucosa and might serve as an inoculum for the lumen. The collateral effects on the microbiota of antibiotic-fed animals caused divergence from that of control animals, with notable changes being increases in Escherichia coli populations in the ileum, Lachnobacterium spp. in all gut locations, and resistance genes to antibiotics not administered. Characterizing the differential metabolic capacities and response to perturbation at distinct intestinal locations will inform strategies to improve gut health and food safety.</jats:p>",0

First detection and analysis of a fish circovirus,"<jats:p>Circoviruses are present worldwide in birds and pigs but their occurrence in fish has not yet been reported. Recently, increased mortality was observed in barbel fry (<jats:italic>Barbus barbus</jats:italic>) in Hungary. This paper reports the detection of previously unknown circular viral DNA genomes in barbels by the use of a circovirus-specific wide-range nested PCR. The analysis of two complete genomes (Barbel circovirus, BaCV1 and BaCV2) indicated that they belonged into a new genetic group within the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, distinct from known circoviruses and circovirus-like genomes. Their genome size was 1957 bases and contained two major ORFs similar to the capsid and replication-associated protein genes of circoviruses. A connection between the presence of the virus and clinical manifestations of the infection could not be proved.</jats:p>",0

In vitro and in vivo identification of structural and sequence elements in the 5′ untranslated region of Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus required for internal initiation,"<jats:p><jats:italic>Ectropis obliqua</jats:italic>picorna-like virus (EoPV) is a newly described insect virus that is classified as a putative member of the genus<jats:italic>Iflavirus</jats:italic>. The virus possesses a large, positive-sense RNA genome encoding a single polyprotein that shares physicochemical properties with those of members of the family<jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>. The 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) plays an important role in picornavirus translation initiation, as it contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that mediates cap-independent translation. To investigate translation in EoPV, an extensive range of mutations were engineered within the 5′ UTR and the effects of these changes were examined<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>by using a bicistronic construct. Results showed that deletions within the first 63 nt had little impact on IRES activity, whilst core IRES function was contained within stem–loops C and D, as their removal abrogated IRES activity significantly. In contrast to these findings, removal of stem–loop G containing two cryptic AUGs caused a remarkable increase in IRES activity, which was further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis at these two positions. It was also confirmed that initiation of protein synthesis occurs at AUG6 (position 391–394) and not at the AUG immediately downstream of the polypyrimidine tract. Mutation of the polypyrimidine tract (CCTTTC) had a slight effect on EoPV IRES activity. Furthermore, mutations of the RAAA motif led to a decrease in IRES activity of approximately 40 %<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>, but these results were not supported by<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>experiments. In conclusion, this study reveals that the EoPV IRES element is unique, although it has features in common with the type II IRESs.</jats:p>",0

                        <jats:p>Geese were domesticated over 6,000 years ago, making them one of the first domesticated poultry. Geese are capable of rapid growth, disease resistance, and high liver lipid storage capacity, and can be easily fed coarse fodder.

                        <jats:p>A draft sequence of the whole-goose genome was obtained by shotgun sequencing, and 16,150 protein-coding genes were predicted. Comparative genomics indicate that significant differences occur between the goose genome and that of other terrestrial bird species, particularly regarding major histocompatibility complex, Myxovirus resistance, Retinoic acid-inducible gene I, and other genes related to disease resistance in geese. In addition, analysis of transcriptome data further reveals a potential molecular mechanism involved in the susceptibility of geese to fatty liver disease and its associated symptoms, including high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and low levels of cholesterol. The results of this study show that deletion of the goose <jats:italic>lep</jats:italic> gene might be the result of positive selection, thus allowing the liver to adopt energy storage mechanisms for long-distance migration.</jats:p>

Evolutionary Relationships among Parvoviruses: Virus-Host Coevolution among Autonomous Primate Parvoviruses and Links between Adeno-Associated and Avian Parvoviruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            The current classification of parvoviruses is based on virus host range and helper virus dependence, while little data on evolutionary relationships among viruses are available. We identified and analyzed 472 sequences of parvoviruses, among which there were (virtually) full-length genomes of all 41 viruses currently recognized as individual species within the family
            <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic>
            . Our phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes as well as open reading frames distinguished three evolutionary groups of parvoviruses from vertebrates: (i) the human helper-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 1 to 6 and the autonomous avian parvoviruses; (ii) the bovine, chipmunk, and autonomous primate parvoviruses, including human viruses B19 and V9; and (iii) the parvoviruses from rodents (except for chipmunks), carnivores, and pigs. Each of these three evolutionary groups could be further subdivided, reflecting both virus-host coevolution and multiple cross-species transmissions in the evolutionary history of parvoviruses. No parvoviruses from invertebrates clustered with vertebrate parvoviruses. Our analysis provided evidence for negative selection among parvoviruses, the independent evolution of their genes, and recombination among parvoviruses from rodents. The topology of the phylogenetic tree of autonomous human and simian parvoviruses matched exactly the topology of the primate family tree, as based on the analysis of primate mitochondrial DNA. Viruses belonging to the AAV group were not evolutionarily linked to other primate parvoviruses but were linked to the parvoviruses of birds. The two lineages of human parvoviruses may have resulted from independent ancient zoonotic infections. Our results provide an argument for reclassification of
            <jats:italic>Parvovirinae</jats:italic>
            based on evolutionary relationships among viruses.

Evolutionary relationships among Astroviridae,"<jats:p>To study the evolutionary relationships among astroviruses, all available sequences for members of the family <jats:italic>Astroviridae</jats:italic> were collected. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished two deep-rooted groups: one comprising mammalian astroviruses, with ovine astrovirus being an outlier, and the other comprising avian astroviruses. All virus species as well as serotypes of human astroviruses represented individual lineages within the tree. All human viruses clustered together and separately from non-human viruses, which argue for their common evolutionary origin and against ongoing animal-to-human transmissions. The branching order of mammalian astroviruses was exactly the opposite of that of their host species, suggesting at least two cross-species transmissions involving pigs, cats and humans, possibly through intermediate hosts. Analysis of synonymous (Ds) versus non-synonymous (Da) distances revealed that negative selection is dominating in the evolution of astroviruses, with the Ds:Da ratios being up to 46 for the comparisons of the most closely related viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of all open reading frames (ORFs) based on Ds resulted in the loss of tree structures, with virus species – and in ORF2, even serotypes of human astroviruses – branching out from virtually a single node, suggesting their ancient separation. The strong selection against non-synonymous substitutions, the low number of which is, therefore, not proof of a recent separation between lineages, together with the position of the oldest available human astrovirus strain (1971) far from the common node of its serotype 4, suggest that intraserotype diversification originates from an earlier date.</jats:p>",0

Hierarchical molecular tagging to resolve long continuous sequences by massively parallel sequencing,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Here we demonstrate the use of short-read massive sequencing systems to in effect achieve longer read lengths through hierarchical molecular tagging. We show how indexed and PCR-amplified targeted libraries are degraded, sub-sampled and arrested at timed intervals to achieve pools of differing average length, each of which is indexed with a new tag. By this process, indices of sample origin, molecular origin and degree of degradation is incorporated in order to achieve a nested hierarchical structure, later to be utilized in the data processing to order the reads over a longer distance than the sequencing system originally allows. With this protocol we show how continuous regions beyond 3000 bp can be decoded by an Illumina sequencing system and we illustrate the potential applications by calling variants of the lambda genome, analysing TP53 in cancer cell lines and targeting a variable canine mitochondrial region.</jats:p>",0

Accurate and precise real-time RT-PCR assays for the identification of astrovirus associated encephalitis in cattle,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A novel bovine astrovirus genotype species (BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1) was recently identified in brain tissues of cattle as a plausible cause of encephalitis. The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate real time RT-PCR assays for the detection of BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 in brain tissues of cattle. Three different primer-probe combinations were designed based on BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 full-genome sequences of 11 different strains identified in cattle, and established in three distinct one-step real time RT-PCR protocols. These protocols were compared regarding their diagnostic performance using brain tissues of cattle with and without astrovirus associated encephalitis. The limit of detection (LOD) of all three assays was between 1.34 × 10<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> and 1.34 × 10<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> RNA copies, leading to an analytical sensitivity two orders of magnitude superior compared to a conventional pan-astrovirus RT-PCR protocol (LOD 1.31 × 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> RNA copies). Amplification efficiency was in the range of 97.3% to 107.5% with linearity (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) &gt; 0.99. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the assays was determined as 100%, and all three revealed good intra- and inter-test repeatability. In conclusion, the newly developed RT-qPCRs are sensitive, specific, and reliable test formats that will facilitate BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 detection in routine diagnostics as well as in research settings.</jats:p>",0

"Human microRNAs profiling in response to influenza A viruses (subtypes pH1N1, H3N2, and H5N1)","<jats:p> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulation of gene silencing and are involved in many cellular processes including inhibition of infected viral replication. This study investigated cellular miRNA expression profiles operating in response to influenza virus in early stage of infection which might be useful for understanding and control of viral infection. A549 cells were infected with different subtypes of influenza virus (pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1). After 24 h post-infection, miRNAs were extracted and then used for DNA library construction. All DNA libraries with different indexes were pooled together with equal concentration, followed by high-throughput sequencing based on MiSeq platform. The miRNAs were identified and counted from sequencing data by using MiSeq reporter software. The miRNAs expressions were classified into up and downregulated miRNAs compared to those found in non-infected cells. Mostly, each subtype of influenza A virus triggered the upregulated responses in miRNA expression profiles. Hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-193b, hsa-miR-23b, and hsa-miR-30e* were upregulated when infected with all three subtypes of influenza A virus. Target prediction results showed that virus infection can trigger genes in cellular process, metabolic process, developmental process and biological regulation. This study provided some insights into the cellular miRNA profiling in response to various subtypes of influenza A viruses in circulation and which have caused outbreaks in human population. The regulated miRNAs might be involved in virus–host interaction or host defense mechanism, which should be investigated for effective antiviral therapeutic interventions. </jats:p>",0

Recombination in Eukaryotic Single Stranded DNA Viruses,"<jats:p>Although single stranded (ss) DNA viruses that infect humans and their domesticated animals do not generally cause major diseases, the arthropod borne ssDNA viruses of plants do, and as a result seriously constrain food production in most temperate regions of the world. Besides the well known plant and animal-infecting ssDNA viruses, it has recently become apparent through metagenomic surveys of ssDNA molecules that there also exist large numbers of other diverse ssDNA viruses within almost all terrestrial and aquatic environments. The host ranges of these viruses probably span the tree of life and they are likely to be important components of global ecosystems. Various lines of evidence suggest that a pivotal evolutionary process during the generation of this global ssDNA virus diversity has probably been genetic recombination. High rates of homologous recombination, non-homologous recombination and genome component reassortment are known to occur within and between various different ssDNA virus species and we look here at the various roles that these different types of recombination may play, both in the day-to-day biology, and in the longer term evolution, of these viruses. We specifically focus on the ecological, biochemical and selective factors underlying patterns of genetic exchange detectable amongst the ssDNA viruses and discuss how these should all be considered when assessing the adaptive value of recombination during ssDNA virus evolution.</jats:p>",0

Genetically they were classified into six distinct genotypes, including five already known genotypes and one novel genotype. This suggested that such multiple genotypes of the H9N2 virus have possibly already become widespread and endemic in China. Two isolates have amino-acid substitutions that confer resistance to amantadine in the M2 region, and this supported the evidence that this mutation might be a result of the wide application of amantadine for avian influenza treatment in China. These findings emphasize the importance of surveillance for avian influenza virus in this region, and of quarantining imported chicken products as potential sources for the introduction of influenza virus.</jats:p>",0

B-cell epitopes of African horse sickness virus serotype 4 recognised by immune horse sera,"<jats:p>Identifying antigenic proteins and mapping their epitopes is important for the development of diagnostic reagents and recombinant vaccines. B-cell epitopes of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) have previously been mapped on VP2, VP5, VP7 and NS1, using mouse, rabbit and chicken monoclonal antibodies. A comprehensive study of the humoral immune response of five vaccinated horses to AHSV-4 antigenic peptides was undertaken. A fragmented-genome phage display library expressing a repertoire of AHSV-4 peptides spanning the entire genome was constructed. The library was affinity selected for binders on immobilised polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from horse sera collected pre- and post-immunisation with an attenuated AHSV-4 monovalent vaccine. The DNA inserts of binding phages were sequenced with Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The data were normalised using preimmune IgG-selected sequences. More sequences mapped to the genes coding for NS3, VP6 and VP5 than to the other genes. However, VP2 and VP5 each had more antigenic regions than each of the other proteins. This study identified a number of epitopes to which the horse’s humoral immune system responds during immunisation with AHSV-4.</jats:p>",0
Human parvovirus 4 ‘PARV4’ remains elusive despite a decade of study,"<ns4:p>Human parvovirus 4 (‘PARV4’) is a small DNA tetraparvovirus, first reported in 2005. In some populations, PARV4 infection is uncommon, and evidence of exposure is found only in individuals with risk factors for parenteral infection who are infected with other blood-borne viruses. In other settings, seroprevalence studies suggest an endemic, age-associated transmission pattern, independent of any specific risk factors. The clinical impact of PARV4 infection remains uncertain, but reported disease associations include an influenza-like syndrome, encephalitis, acceleration of HIV disease, and foetal hydrops. In this review, we set out to report progress updates from the recent literature, focusing on the investigation of cohorts in different geographical settings, now including insights from Asia, the Middle East, and South America, and discussing whether attributes of viral or host populations underpin the striking differences in epidemiology. We review progress in understanding viral phylogeny and biology, approaches to diagnostics, and insights that might be gained from studies of closely related animal pathogens. Crucial questions about pathogenicity remain unanswered, but we highlight new evidence supporting a possible link between PARV4 and an encephalitis syndrome. The unequivocal evidence that PARV4 is endemic in certain populations should drive ongoing research efforts to understand risk factors and routes of transmission and to gain new insights into the impact of this virus on human health.</ns4:p>",0
Full Genome-Based Classification of Rotaviruses Reveals a Common Origin between Human Wa-Like and Porcine Rotavirus Strains and Human DS-1-Like and Bovine Rotavirus Strains,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Group A rotavirus classification is currently based on the molecular properties of the two outer layer proteins, VP7 and VP4, and the middle layer protein, VP6. As reassortment of all the 11 rotavirus gene segments plays a key role in generating rotavirus diversity in nature, a classification system that is based on all the rotavirus gene segments is desirable for determining which genes influence rotavirus host range restriction, replication, and virulence, as well as for studying rotavirus epidemiology and evolution. Toward establishing such a classification system, gene sequences encoding VP1 to VP3, VP6, and NSP1 to NSP5 were determined for human and animal rotavirus strains belonging to different G and P genotypes in addition to those available in databases, and they were used to define phylogenetic relationships among all rotavirus genes. Based on these phylogenetic analyses, appropriate identity cutoff values were determined for each gene. For the VP4 gene, a nucleotide identity cutoff value of 80% completely correlated with the 27 established P genotypes. For the VP7 gene, a nucleotide identity cutoff value of 80% largely coincided with the established G genotypes but identified four additional distinct genotypes comprised of murine or avian rotavirus strains. Phylogenetic analyses of the VP1 to VP3, VP6, and NSP1 to NSP5 genes showed the existence of 4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 5, 7, 11, and 6 genotypes, respectively, based on nucleotide identity cutoff values of 83%, 84%, 81%, 85%, 79%, 85%, 85%, 85%, and 91%, respectively. In accordance with these data, a revised nomenclature of rotavirus strains is proposed. The novel classification system allows the identification of (i) distinct genotypes, which probably followed separate evolutionary paths; (ii) interspecies transmissions and a plethora of reassortment events; and (iii) certain gene constellations that revealed (a) a common origin between human Wa-like rotavirus strains and porcine rotavirus strains and (b) a common origin between human DS-1-like rotavirus strains and bovine rotaviruses. These close evolutionary links between human and animal rotaviruses emphasize the need for close simultaneous monitoring of rotaviruses in animals and humans.</jats:p>",0
Complete molecular genome analyses of equine rotavirus A strains from different continents reveal several novel genotypes and a largely conserved genotype constellation,"<jats:p>In this study, the complete genome sequences of seven equine group A rotavirus (RVA) strains (RVA/Horse-tc/GBR/L338/1991/G13P[18], RVA/Horse-wt/IRL/03V04954/2003/G3P[12] and RVA/Horse-wt/IRL/04V2024/2004/G14P[12] from Europe; RVA/Horse-wt/ARG/E30/1993/G3P[12], RVA/Horse-wt/ARG/E403/2006/G14P[12] and RVA/Horse-wt/ARG/E4040/2008/G14P[12] from Argentina; and RVA/Horse-wt/ZAF/EqRV-SA1/2006/G14P[12] from South Africa) were determined. Multiple novel genotypes were identified and genotype numbers were assigned by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group: R9 (VP1), C9 (VP2), N9 (NSP2), T12 (NSP3), E14 (NSP4), and H7 and H11 (NSP5). The genotype constellation of L338 was unique: G13-P[18]-I6-R9-C9-M6-A6-N9-T12-E14-H11. The six remaining equine RVA strains showed a largely conserved genotype constellation: G3/G14-P[12]-I2/I6-R2-C2-M3-A10-N2-T3-E2/E12-H7, which is highly divergent from other known non-equine RVA genotype constellations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the sequences of these equine RVA strains are related distantly to non-equine RVA strains, and that at least three lineages exist within equine RVA strains. A small number of reassortment events were observed. Interestingly, the three RVA strains from Argentina possessed the E12 genotype, whereas the three RVA strains from Ireland and South Africa possessed the E2 genotype. The unusual E12 genotype has until now only been described in Argentina among RVA strains collected from guanaco, cattle and horses, suggesting geographical isolation of this NSP4 genotype. This conserved genetic configuration of equine RVA strains could be useful for future vaccine development or improvement of currently used equine RVA vaccines.</jats:p>",0

Cowpox virus: What’s in a Name?,"<jats:p>Traditionally, virus taxonomy relied on phenotypic properties; however, a sequence-based virus taxonomy has become essential since the recent requirement of a species to exhibit monophyly. The species Cowpox virus has failed to meet this requirement, necessitating a reexamination of this species. Here, we report the genomic sequences of nine Cowpox viruses and, by combining them with the available data of 37 additional genomes, confirm polyphyly of Cowpox viruses and find statistical support based on genetic data for more than a dozen species. These results are discussed in light of the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses species definition, as well as immediate and future implications for poxvirus taxonomic classification schemes. Data support the recognition of five monophyletic clades of Cowpox viruses as valid species.</jats:p>",0

Interruption of cytokine networks by poxviruses: lessons from myxoma virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Myxoma virus is an infectious poxvirus pathogen that induces a virulent systemic disease called myxomatosis in European rabbits. The disease is rapidly and uniformly fatal to susceptible rabbits and is characterized by generalized dysfunction of cellular immunity and multiple interruptions of the host cytokine network. A number of virus genes are classified as virulence factors because virus constructs bearing targeted gene disruptions induce attenuated disease symptoms. Many of these genes encode proteins that interact directly with effector elements of the host immune system. Included among these immunosubversive viral proteins are secreted mimics of host ligands or regulators (virokines) and homologues of cellular cytokine receptors (viroceptors). Five examples of these immune modulator proteins encoded by myxoma virus are reviewed: (1) myxoma growth factor, a member of the epidermal growth factor ligand superfamily; (2) SERP-1, a secreted serine proteinase inhibitor; (3) M11L, a receptor-like surface protein; (4) T2, a tumor necrosis factor receptor homologue; and (5) T7, an interferon-γ receptor homologue. The origin of viral strategies designed to subvert immune regulation by host cytokines is considered in the context of the biology of myxoma virus within immunocompetent hosts. J. Leukoc.

Canine distemper virus infection in a lesser grison (Galictis cuja): first report and virus phylogeny,"<jats:p>Infectious diseases in wild animals have been increasing as a result of their habitat alterations and closer contact with domestic animals. Canine distemper virus (CDV) has been reported in several species of wild carnivores, presenting a threat to wildlife conservation. We described the first case of canine distemper virus infection in lesser grison (Galictis cuja). A free-ranging individual, with no visible clinical sigs, presented sudden death after one day in captivity. Molecular diagnosis for CDV infection was performed using whole blood collected by postmortem intracardiac puncture, which resulted positive.

"Nyamanini and Midway Viruses Define a Novel Taxon of RNA Viruses in the Order

          <jats:p>
            Here, we report the sequencing and classification of Nyamanini virus (NYMV) and Midway virus (MIDWV), two antigenically related viruses that were first isolated in 1957 and 1966, respectively. Although these viruses have been cultured multiple times from cattle egrets, seabirds, and their ticks, efforts to classify them taxonomically using conventional serological and electron microscopic approaches have failed completely. We used a random shotgun sequencing strategy to define the genomes of NYMV and MIDWV. Contigs of 11,631 and 11,752 nucleotides, representing the complete genome of NYMV and the near-complete genome of MIDWV, respectively, were assembled. Each virus genome was predicted to carry six open reading frames (ORFs). BLAST analysis indicated that only two of the ORF proteins of each virus, the putative nucleocapsid and polymerase, had detectable sequence similarity to known viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of these ORF proteins demonstrated that the closest relatives of NYNV and MIDWV are negative-stranded-RNA viruses in the order
            <jats:italic>Mononegavirales</jats:italic>
            . On the basis of their very limited sequence similarity to known viruses, we propose that NYMV and MIDWV define a novel genus,

After a 2‐year hiatus following the initial announcement, the first devices have been released as part of an early access program. We explore the performance of this platform by resequencing the lambda phage genome, and amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the handheld Min<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ION</jats:styled-content> sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting reads map to the reference, with less than average 10% identity. Much of the sequence consists of insertion/deletion errors, or is seemingly without similarity to the template. Using the lambda phage data as an example, although the reads are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 ± 1932 bases per mapped read could be matched to the reference without soft clipping. In the course of a 36 h run on the MinION, it was possible to resequence the 48 kb lambda phage reference at 16× coverage. Currently, substantially larger projects would not be feasible using the Min<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ION</jats:styled-content>. Without increases in accuracy, which would be required for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, the current utility of the Min<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ION</jats:styled-content> appears limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory, and is of similar complexity and cost to that of other next‐generation sequencing platforms.

Common evolutionary origin of hepatitis B virus and retroviruses.,"<jats:p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV), although classified as a double-stranded DNA virus, has been shown recently to replicate by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Also, the putative viral polymerase has been found to share amino acid homology with reverse transcriptase of retroviruses. Using computer-assisted DNA and protein sequence analyses, we examined the genomes of 13 hepadnavirus isolates (nine human, two duck, one woodchuck, and one ground squirrel) and found that other conserved regions of the hepadnavirus genome share homology to corresponding regions of the genomes of type C retroviruses and retrovirus-like endogenous human DNA elements. Specifically, the most highly conserved sequence of the HBV genome, positioned at or near the initiation site for first-strand HBV DNA synthesis, is homologous over 67 nucleotides to the U5 region, a comparable region in retrovirus long terminal repeats. Within a highly conserved (i.e., 90%) 16-nucleotide sequence a heptanucleotide sequence CCTTGGG is 97% homologous between 27 virus isolates. Also, we found that the highly conserved HBV core, or nucleocapsid, protein shares 41% homology over 98 amino acids with the carboxyl-terminal region of the p30 gag nucleocapsid protein of type C retroviruses. In both cases, as with the previously reported polymerase homology, HBV is most homologous to the murine leukemia/sarcoma retroviruses. Further analysis revealed additional similarities between hepadnavirus and retroviral genomes. Taken together, our results suggest that HBV and retroviruses have a common evolutionary origin, with HBV arising through a process of deletion from a retrovirus, or retrovirus-like, progenitor.</jats:p>",0

A Systematic Review of the Natural Virome of Anopheles Mosquitoes,"<jats:p>Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors of human malaria, but they also harbor viruses, collectively termed the virome. The Anopheles virome is relatively poorly studied, and the number and function of viruses are unknown. Only the o’nyong-nyong arbovirus (ONNV) is known to be consistently transmitted to vertebrates by Anopheles mosquitoes. A systematic literature review searched four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Lissa. In addition, online and print resources were searched manually. The searches yielded 259 records. After screening for eligibility criteria, we found at least 51 viruses reported in Anopheles, including viruses with potential to cause febrile disease if transmitted to humans or other vertebrates. Studies to date have not provided evidence that Anopheles consistently transmit and maintain arboviruses other than ONNV. However, anthropophilic Anopheles vectors of malaria are constantly exposed to arboviruses in human bloodmeals. It is possible that in malaria-endemic zones, febrile symptoms may be commonly misdiagnosed. It is also possible that anophelines may be inherently less competent arbovirus vectors than culicines, but if true, the biological basis would warrant further study. This systematic review contributes a context to characterize the biology, knowledge gaps, and potential public health risk of Anopheles viruses.</jats:p>",0
Rapid evolution of the human gut virome,"<jats:p>
            Humans are colonized by immense populations of viruses, which metagenomic analysis shows are mostly unique to each individual. To investigate the origin and evolution of the human gut virome, we analyzed the viral community of one adult individual over 2.5 y by extremely deep metagenomic sequencing (56 billion bases of purified viral sequence from 24 longitudinal fecal samples). After assembly, 478 well-determined contigs could be identified, which are inferred to correspond mostly to previously unstudied bacteriophage genomes. Fully 80% of these types persisted throughout the duration of the 2.5-y study, indicating long-term global stability. Mechanisms of base substitution, rates of accumulation, and the amount of variation varied among viral types. Temperate phages showed relatively lower mutation rates, consistent with replication by accurate bacterial DNA polymerases in the integrated prophage state. In contrast, Microviridae, which are lytic bacteriophages with single-stranded circular DNA genomes, showed high substitution rates (&gt;10
            <jats:sup>−5</jats:sup>
            per nucleotide each day), so that sequence divergence over the 2.5-y period studied approached values sufficient to distinguish new viral species. Longitudinal changes also were associated with diversity-generating retroelements and virus-encoded Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats arrays. We infer that the extreme interpersonal diversity of human gut viruses derives from two sources, persistence of a small portion of the global virome within the gut of each individual and rapid evolution of some long-term virome members.

Genetic diversity of bovine diarrhea and mucosal disease virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified as a member of the <jats:italic>Pestivirus</jats:italic> genus of the <jats:italic>Flaviviridae</jats:italic> family. BVDV is one of the most important viral pathogens of ruminants worldwide, causing severe economic losses. Infection results in a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild respiratory disease to fetal death and mucosal disease. The virus particles are small and contain a singlestranded, positive-sense RNA molecule of approximately 12.3 kb with one large open reading frame flanked by two untranslated regions (5’UTR and 3’UTR). The polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved by viral and host proteases resulting in the formation of mature viral proteins. It is well established that BVDV strains show considerable genetic diversity. BVD viruses are classified as two species: BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. Quite recently, a new putative species, BVDV-3, was detected. The viruses exist as one of two biotypes: cytopathic or non- cytopathic, based on their activity in cell cultures. The phylogenetic analysis of the 5’UTR and N<jats:sup>pro</jats:sup> region has revealed at least 21 distinct subtypes of BVDV-1 and 4 subtypes of BVDV-2. Genetic diversity of BVD viruses has serious clinical implications such as immune evasion, increase of virulence, host range alteration and also affects the efficacy of vaccination programmes and diagnostic methods.</jats:p>

The Genome of the Chicken DT40 Bursal Lymphoma Cell Line,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>The chicken DT40 cell line is a widely used model system in the study of multiple cellular processes due to the efficiency of homologous gene targeting. The cell line was derived from a bursal lymphoma induced by avian leukosis virus infection. In this study we characterized the genome of the cell line using whole genome shotgun sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism array hybridization. The results indicate that wild-type DT40 has a relatively normal karyotype, except for whole chromosome copy number gains, and no karyotype variability within stocks. In a comparison to two domestic chicken genomes and the Gallus gallus reference genome, we found no unique mutational processes shaping the DT40 genome except for a mild increase in insertion and deletion events, particularly deletions at tandem repeats. We mapped coding sequence mutations that are unique to the DT40 genome; mutations inactivating the PIK3R1 and ATRX genes likely contributed to the oncogenic transformation. In addition to a known avian leukosis virus integration in the MYC gene, we detected further integration sites that are likely to de-regulate gene expression. The new findings support the hypothesis that DT40 is a typical transformed cell line with a relatively intact genome; therefore, it is well-suited to the role of a model system for DNA repair and related processes. The sequence data generated by this study, including a searchable de novo genome assembly and annotated lists of mutated genes, will support future research using this cell line.</jats:p>",0

Seventy-three FBS lots were screened by a RT-PCR targeting the 5’untranslated region (UTR) of the pestivirus genome. Thirty-nine lots (53.4%) were positive for pestivirus RNA and one contained infectious virus. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 5’UTR revealed 34 lots (46.6%) containing RNA of bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1), being 23 BVDV-1a (5’ UTR identity 90.8-98.7%), eight BVDV-1b (93.9-96.7%) and three BVDV-1d (96.2- 97.6%). Six lots (8.2%) contained BVDV-2 (90.3-100% UTR identity) being two BVDV-2a; three BVDV-2b and one undetermined. Four FBS batches (5.5%) were found contaminated with HoBi-like virus (98.3 to 100%). Five batches (6.8%) contained more than one pestivirus. The high frequency of contamination of FBS with pestivirus RNA reinforce the need for systematic and updated guidelines for monitoring this product to reduce the risk of contamination of biologicals and introduction of contaminating agents into free areas.</jats:p>",0

The current study was conducted for the detection and molecular characterization of astroviruses in diarrheic pigs submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, University of Minnesota. Intestinal contents from 269 pigs were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 62% were found positive for astroviruses. Of the positive samples, 20% were positive for astrovirus alone while astrovirus with rotavirus was detected in 58% of the samples. The remaining 22% revealed the presence of astrovirus along with Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, Transmissible gastroenteritis virus, or Porcine circovirus-2. Sequencing the capsid gene of 56 randomly selected samples confirmed them to be Porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV-4) with 58–100% nucleotide identity within these viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 2 possible subgroups. The results indicate that PAstV is present on swine farms in the United States and that it may be associated with diarrhea either alone or in combination with other enteric viruses. Further studies are needed to determine strain diversity among porcine astroviruses so that appropriate control strategies can be devised and implemented. </jats:p>",0

"Genomic evolution, recombination, and inter-strain diversity of chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 from Florida and Hawaii green sea turtles with fibropapillomatosis","<jats:p>Chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is a herpesvirus associated with fibropapillomatosis (FP) in sea turtles worldwide. Single-locus typing has previously shown differentiation between Atlantic and Pacific strains of this virus, with low variation within each geographic clade. However, a lack of multi-locus genomic sequence data hinders understanding of the rate and mechanisms of ChHV5 evolutionary divergence, as well as how these genomic changes may contribute to differences in disease manifestation. To assess genomic variation in ChHV5 among five Hawaii and three Florida green sea turtles, we used high-throughput short-read sequencing of long-range PCR products amplified from tumor tissue using primers designed from the single available ChHV5 reference genome from a Hawaii green sea turtle. This strategy recovered sequence data from both geographic regions for approximately 75% of the predicted ChHV5 coding sequences. The average nucleotide divergence between geographic populations was 1.5%; most of the substitutions were fixed differences between regions. Protein divergence was generally low (average 0.08%), and ranged between 0 and 5.3%. Several atypical genes originally identified and annotated in the reference genome were confirmed in ChHV5 genomes from both geographic locations. Unambiguous recombination events between geographic regions were identified, and clustering of private alleles suggests the prevalence of recombination in the evolutionary history of ChHV5. This study significantly increased the amount of sequence data available from ChHV5 strains, enabling informed selection of loci for future population genetic and natural history studies, and suggesting the (possibly latent) co-infection of individuals by well-differentiated geographic variants.</jats:p>",0

RNA2DMut: a web tool for the design and analysis of RNA structure mutations,"<jats:p>With the widespread application of high-throughput sequencing, novel RNA sequences are being discovered at an astonishing rate. The analysis of function, however, lags behind. In both the<jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>- and<jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>-regulatory functions of RNA, secondary structure (2D base-pairing) plays essential regulatory roles. In order to test RNA function, it is essential to be able to design and analyze mutations that can affect structure. This was the motivation for the creation of the RNA2DMut web tool. With RNA2DMut, users can enter in RNA sequences to analyze, constrain mutations to specific residues, or limit changes to purines/pyrimidines. The sequence is analyzed at each base to determine the effect of every possible point mutation on 2D structure. The metrics used in RNA2DMut rely on the calculation of the Boltzmann structure ensemble and do not require a robust 2D model of RNA structure for designing mutations. This tool can facilitate a wide array of uses involving RNA: for example, in designing and evaluating mutants for biological assays, interrogating RNA–protein interactions, identifying key regions to alter in SELEX experiments, and improving RNA folding and crystallization properties for structural biology. Additional tools are available to help users introduce other mutations (e.g., indels and substitutions) and evaluate their effects on RNA structure. Example calculations are shown for five RNAs that require 2D structure for their function: the MALAT1 mascRNA, an influenza virus splicing regulatory motif, the EBER2 viral noncoding RNA, the Xist lncRNA repA region, and human Y RNA 5.

‘Next‐Generation’ Surveillance: An Epidemiologists’ Perspective on the Use of Molecular Information in Food Safety and Animal Health Decision‐Making,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Advances in the availability and affordability of molecular and genomic data are transforming human health care. Surveillance aimed at supporting and improving food safety and animal health is likely to undergo a similar transformation. We propose a definition of ‘molecular surveillance’ in this context and argue that molecular data are an adjunct to rather than a substitute for sound epidemiological study and surveillance design. Specific considerations with regard to sample collection are raised, as is the importance of the relation between the molecular clock speed of genetic markers and the spatiotemporal scale of the surveillance activity, which can be control‐ or strategy‐focused. Development of standards for study design and assessment of molecular surveillance system attributes is needed, together with development of an interdisciplinary skills base covering both molecular and epidemiological principles.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Molecular and biophysical characterization of TT virus: Evidence for a new virus family infecting humans,"<jats:p>The recent isolation of a novel DNA virus from the serum of a Japanese patient (T.T.) has provided the latest possible candidate virus associated with cryptogenic hepatitis. In the present study, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus (TTV) isolated from the serum of a West African. Based on PCR studies designed to amplify overlapping regions of the viral genome and sensitivity to digestion with mung bean nuclease, the viral genome is circular and negative stranded, and comprises 3,852 nt, which is 113 nt longer than the prototype isolate from Japan. Cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation demonstrated banding of the virus at 1.31–1.34 g/ml; filtration studies indicated that TTV had a particle size of 30–50 nm. These results suggest that the virus is similar to the Circoviridae, viruses known to infect plants and vertebrates (e.g., birds and swine); however, sequence similarity searches of available databases did not reveal identity between TTV and other viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of a 260-nt region from 151 globally distributed isolates demonstrated the existence of three major TTV genotypes. Several individuals at high risk for infection with parenterally transmitted viruses were infected with more than one genotype. There was no correlation between genotype and geographic origin. Finally, intravenous inoculation of TTV-positive human serum into chimpanzees demonstrated that TTV can be transmitted to primates; no biochemical or histological evidence for hepatitis was obtained. The distinct biophysical and molecular characteristics of TTV suggest that it is a member of a new family of viruses, which we have tentatively named the Circinoviridae.</jats:p>",0

Novel real-time PCR-based patho- and phylotyping of potentially zoonotic avian influenza A subtype H5 viruses at risk of incursion into Europe in 2017,"<jats:p>Since November 2016, Europe witnesses another wave of incursion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses of the Asian origin goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage. Infections with H5 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b affect wild bird and poultry populations. H5 viruses of clades 2.2, 2.3.1.2c and 2.3.4.4a were detected previously in Europe in 2006, 2010 and 2014. Clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1.c are endemic in Egypt and Western Africa, respectively and have caused human fatalities. Evidence exists of their co-circulation in the Middle East. Subtype H5 viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAI) are endemic in migratory wild bird populations. They potentially mutate into highly pathogenic phenotypes following transmission into poultry holdings. However, to date only the gs/GD H5 lineage had an impact on human health. Rapid and specific diagnosis marks the cornerstone for control and eradication of HPAI virus incursions. We present the development and validation of five real-time RT-PCR assays (RT-qPCR) that allow sequencing-independent pathotype and clade-specific distinction of major gs/GD HPAI H5 virus clades and of Eurasian LPAI viruses currently circulating. Together with an influenza A virus-generic RT-qPCR, the assays significantly speed up time-to-diagnosis and reduce reaction times in a OneHealth approach of curbing the spread of gs/GD HPAI viruses.</jats:p>",0

Dysfunction of Bovine Endogenous Retrovirus K2 Envelope Glycoprotein Is Related to Unsuccessful Intracellular Trafficking,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are the remnants of retroviral infection of ancestral germ cells. Mutations introduced into ERVs halt the production of infectious agents, but their effects on the function of retroviral proteins are not fully understood. Retroviral envelope glycoproteins (Envs) are utilized in membrane fusion during viral entry, and we recently identified intact coding sequences for bovine endogenous retrovirus K1 (BERV-K1) and BERV-K2 Envs. Amino acid sequences of BERV-K1 Env (also called Fematrin-1) and BERV-K2 Env are similar, and both viruses are classified in the genus
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Betaretrovirus</jats:named-content>
            . While Fematrin-1 plays an important role in cell-to-cell fusion in bovine placenta, the BERV-K2 envelope gene is marginally expressed
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            , and its recombinant Env protein is defective in membrane fusion due to inefficient cleavage of surface (SU) and transmembrane subunits. Here, we conducted chimeric analyses of Fematrin-1 and BERV-K2 Envs and revealed that defective maturation of BERV-K2 Env contributed to failed intracellular trafficking. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis suggested that in contrast to Fematrin-1 Env, BERV-K2 Env could not be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the
            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>
            -Golgi network, where cellular proteases required for processing retroviral Envs are localized. We also identified that one of the responsive regions of this phenomenon resided within a 65-amino-acid region of BERV-K2 SU. This is the first report to identify that retroviral Env SU is involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, and it may help to elucidate the maturation process of Fematrin-1 and other related Envs.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Retroviruses utilize envelope glycoproteins (Envs) to enter host target cells. Mature retroviral Env is a heterodimer, which consists of surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) subunits that are generated by the cleavage of an Env precursor protein in the
            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>
            -Golgi network. SU and TM mediate the recognition of the entry receptor and virus-host membrane fusion, respectively. However, unexplained issues remain for the maturation process of retroviral Env. We previously reported that bovine endogenous retrovirus K2 (BERV-K2) Env lost fusogenicity due to a defect in the cleavage of SU and TM. In this study, we identified that mutations residing in BERV-K2 SU disturbed intracellular trafficking of BERV-K2 Env and resulted its inefficient cleavage. Because SU is not known to play an important role in this process, our study may provide novel insights into the maturation mechanism of retroviral Envs.

Genetic Predisposition To Acquire a Polybasic Cleavage Site for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses with H5 and H7 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes evolve from low-pathogenic precursors through the acquisition of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been observed to occur naturally only in these HA subtypes, little is known about the genetic basis for the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site. Here we show that consecutive adenine residues and a stem-loop structure, which are frequently found in the viral RNA region encoding amino acids around the cleavage site of low-pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses isolated from waterfowl reservoirs, are important for nucleotide insertions into this RNA region. A reporter assay to detect nontemplated nucleotide insertions and deep-sequencing analysis of viral RNAs revealed that an increased number of adenine residues and enlarged stem-loop structure in the RNA region accelerated the multiple adenine and/or guanine insertions required to create codons for basic amino acids. Interestingly, nucleotide insertions associated with the HA cleavage site motif were not observed principally in the viral RNA of other subtypes tested (H1, H2, H3, and H4). Our findings suggest that the RNA editing-like activity is the key mechanism for nucleotide insertions, providing a clue as to why the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is restricted to the particular HA subtypes.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on the antigenicity of the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase. Of the 16 HA subtypes (H1 to -16) maintained in waterfowl reservoirs of influenza A viruses, H5 and H7 viruses often become highly pathogenic through the acquisition of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been known since the 1980s, the genetic basis for nucleotide insertions has remained unclear. This study shows the potential role of the viral RNA secondary structure for nucleotide insertions and demonstrates a key mechanism explaining why the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is restricted to particular HA subtypes in nature. Our findings will contribute to better understanding of the ecology of influenza A viruses and will also be useful for the development of genetically modified vaccines against H5 and H7 influenza A viruses with increased stability.

Long‐term evolution of viruses: A Janus‐faced balance,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>The popular textbook image of viruses as noxious and selfish genetic parasites greatly underestimates the beneficial contributions of viruses to the biosphere. Given the crucial dependency of viruses to reproduce in an intracellular environment, viruses that engage in excessive killing (lysis) can drive their cellular hosts to extinction and will not survive. The lytic mode of virus propagation must, therefore, be tempered and balanced by non‐lytic modes of virus latency and symbiosis. Here, we review recent bioinformatics and metagenomic studies to argue that viral endogenization and domestication may be more frequent mechanisms of virus persistence than lysis. We use a triangle diagram to explain the three major virus persistence strategies that explain the global scope of virus‐cell interactions including lysis, latency and virus‐cell symbiosis. This paradigm can help identify novel directions in virology research where scientists could artificially gain control over switching lytic and beneficial viral lifestyles.

            Avian leukosis virus (ALV) induces tumors by integrating its proviral DNA into the chicken genome and altering the expression of nearby genes via strong promoter and enhancer elements.

Genetic relatedness of the caliciviruses: San Miguel sea lion and vesicular exanthema of swine viruses constitute a single genotype within the Caliciviridae,"<jats:p>The San Miguel sea lion viruses (SMSV) and vesicular exanthema of swine viruses (VESV) are related morphologically and antigenically, but little has been done to determine their genotypic relationship to each other and to other caliciviruses. To examine this relationship, reverse transcriptase PCRs were performed by using oligonucleotide primer sets designed to amplify portions of the 2C RNA helicase-like and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions with total cellular RNA purified from virus-infected cell cultures as a template. The 2C RNA helicase primers directed the amplification of this region from eight SMSV serotypes, five VESV serotypes, and four related viruses. The RNA polymerase primer sets amplified products from all these viruses except one. Phylogenetic comparison of the caliciviruses demonstrated that SMSV, VESV, and four related viruses are closely related while being distinct from feline calicivirus, the human caliciviruses (small, round-structured viruses), and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and that they should be classified as a single genotype within the Caliciviridae.</jats:p>",0
Donor‐derived infections and infectious risk in xenotransplantation and allotransplantation,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Post‐transplantation infections are common in allograft recipients and should be expected in all immunocompromised hosts. Based on the need for immunosuppression in xenotransplantation, procedures developed to enhance safety in allotransplantation can be applied in future xenotransplantation clinical trials. Standardized approaches can be developed to guide the evaluation of common infectious syndromes in xenograft recipients. The opportunity created by screening of swine intended as xenograft donors has equal applicability to allotransplantation—notably broader screening strategies for allograft donors such as use of advanced sequencing modalities including broad‐range molecular probes, microarrays, and high‐throughput pyrosequencing. Considerations in management of allotransplant‐ and xenotransplant‐associated infections are largely the same. Experience in xenotransplantation will continue to inform thinking regarding donor‐derived infections in allotransplantation. We expect that experience in managing complex allotransplant recipients will similarly inform clinical trials in xenotransplantation.</jats:p>",0

Metagenomic identification of a novel anellovirus in Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsii) lung samples and its detection in samples from multiple years,"<jats:p>To investigate viral pathogens potentially involved in a mortality event of 21 Pacific harbor seals (<jats:italic>Phoca vitulina richardsii</jats:italic>) in California in 2000, viral metagenomics was performed directly on lung samples from five individuals. Metagenomics revealed a novel seal anellovirus (SealAV), which clusters phylogenetically with anelloviruses from California sea lions and domestic cats. Using specific PCR, SealAV was identified in lung tissue from two of five animals involved in the 2000 mortality event, as well as one of 20 harbor seal samples examined post-mortem in 2008. The identification of SealAV in multiple years demonstrates that this virus is persistent in the harbor seal population. SealAV is the second anellovirus reported in the lungs of pinnipeds, suggesting that anellovirus infections may be common amongst marine mammals and that more research is needed to understand the roles of these viruses in marine mammal health and disease.</jats:p>",0
A Metagenomics and Case-Control Study To Identify Viruses Associated with Bovine Respiratory Disease,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a common health problem for both dairy and beef cattle, resulting in significant economic loses. In order to identify viruses associated with BRD, we used a metagenomics approach to enrich and sequence viral nucleic acids in the nasal swabs of 50 young dairy cattle with symptoms of BRD. Following deep sequencing,
            <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>
            assembly, and translated protein sequence similarity searches, numerous known and previously uncharacterized viruses were identified. Bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine influenza D virus, bovine parvovirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 6, bovine rhinitis A virus, and multiple genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus were identified. The genomes of a previously uncharacterized astrovirus and picobirnaviruses were also partially or fully sequenced. Using real-time PCR, the rates of detection of the eight viruses that generated the most reads were compared for the nasal secretions of 50 animals with BRD versus 50 location-matched healthy control animals. Viruses were detected in 68% of BRD-affected animals versus 16% of healthy control animals. Thirty-eight percent of sick animals versus 8% of controls were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. Significantly associated with BRD were bovine adenovirus 3 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (

            = 0.006), which were detected either alone or in combination in 62% of animals with BRD. A metagenomics and real-time PCR detection approach in carefully matched cases and controls can provide a rapid means to identify viruses associated with a complex disease, paving the way for further confirmatory tests and ultimately to effective intervention strategies.

Using a case-control format with location-matched animals, we compared the rates of viral detection and identified 3 viruses associated with severe BRD signs.

          <jats:p>Viral metagenomics, consisting of viral particle purification and shotgun sequencing, is a powerful technique for discovering viruses associated with diseases with no definitive etiology, viruses that share limited homology with known viruses, or viruses that are not culturable.

By means of purifying and shotgun sequencing the viral community directly from the fibropapilloma of a Florida green sea turtle, a novel single-stranded DNA virus, sea turtle tornovirus 1 (STTV1), was discovered. The single-stranded, circular genome of STTV1 was approximately 1,800 nucleotides in length. STTV1 has only weak amino acid level identities (25%) to chicken anemia virus in short regions of its genome; hence, STTV1 may represent the first member of a novel virus family. A total of 35 healthy turtles and 27 turtles with FP were tested for STTV1 using PCR, and only 2 turtles severely afflicted with FP were positive. The affected turtles were systemically infected with STTV1, since STTV1 was found in blood and all major organs. STTV1 exists as a quasispecies, with several genome variants identified in the fibropapilloma of each positive turtle, suggesting rapid evolution of this virus. The STTV1 variants were identical over the majority of their genomes but contained a hypervariable region with extensive divergence. This study demonstrates the potential of viral metagenomics for discovering novel viruses directly from animal tissue, which can enhance our understanding of viral evolution and diversity.</jats:p>",0

Novel anellovirus discovered from a mortality event of captive California sea lions,"<jats:p>A viral metagenomic study was performed to investigate potential viral pathogens associated with a mortality event of three captive California sea lions (<jats:italic>Zalophus californianus</jats:italic>). This study identified a novel California sea lion anellovirus (ZcAV), with 35 % amino acid identity in the ORF1 region to feline anelloviruses. The double-stranded replicative form of ZcAV was detected in lung tissue, suggesting that ZcAV replicates in sea lion lungs. Specific PCR revealed the presence of ZcAV in the lung tissue of all three sea lions involved in the mortality event, but not in three other sea lions from the same zoo. In addition, ZcAV was detected at low frequency (11 %) in the lungs of wild sea lions. The higher prevalence of ZcAV and presence of the double-stranded replicative form in the lungs of sea lions from the mortality event suggest that ZcAV was associated with the death of these animals.</jats:p>",0

Hepatitis E virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive‐stranded RNA virus with a 7.2 kb genome that is capped and polyadenylated. The virus is currently unclassified: the organisation of the genome resembles that of the <jats:italic>Caliciviridae</jats:italic> but sequence analyses suggest it is more closely related to the <jats:italic>Togaviridae</jats:italic>. Hepatitis E virus is an enterically transmitted virus that causes both epidemics and sporadic cases of acute hepatitis in many countries of Asia and Africa but only rarely causes disease in more industrialised countries. Initially the virus was believed to have a limited geographical distribution. However, serological studies suggest that HEV may be endemic also in the United States and Europe even though it infrequently causes overt disease in these countries. Many different animal species worldwide recently have been shown to have antibodies to HEV suggesting that hepatitis E may be zoonotic. Although two related strains have been experimentally transmitted between species, direct transmission from an animal to a human has not been documented. There are four currently recognised genotypes and two of the four contain viruses isolated from swine as well as from humans. Regardless of country of origin or genotype of the virus, most, if not all, strains belong to a single serotype. A promising recombinant vaccine candidate comprised of a truncated capsid protein is currently under evaluation in Nepal. Published in 2003 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",0

Different RNA splicing mechanisms contribute to diverse infective outcome of classical swine fever viruses of differing virulence: insights from the deep sequencing data in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells,"<jats:p>Molecular mechanisms underlying RNA splicing regulation in response to viral infection are poorly understood. Classical swine fever (CSF), one of the most economically important and highly contagious swine diseases worldwide, is caused by classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain the digital gene expression (DGE) profile in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells (SUVEC) to identify different response genes for CSFV by using both Shimen and C strains. The numbers of clean tags obtained from the libraries of the control and both CSFV-infected libraries were 3,473,370, 3,498,355, and 3,327,493 respectively. In the comparison among the control, CSFV-C, and CSFV-Shimen groups, 644, 158, and 677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were confirmed in the three groups. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that many of these DEGs were enriched in spliceosome, ribosome, proteasome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, cell cycle, focal adhesion, Wnt signalling pathway, etc., where the processes differ between CSFV strains of differing virulence. To further elucidate important mechanisms related to the differential infection by the CSFV Shimen and C strains, we identified four possible profiles to assess the significantly expressed genes only by CSFV Shimen or CSFV C strain. GO analysis showed that infection with CSFV Shimen and C strains disturbed ‘RNA splicing’ of SUVEC, resulting in differential ‘gene expression’ in SUVEC. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identified as a significant response regulator contributed to impact on SUVEC function for CSFV Shimen. This computational study suggests that CSFV of differing virulence could induce alterations in RNA splicing regulation in the host cell to change cell metabolism, resulting in acute haemorrhage and pathological damage or infectious tolerance.</jats:p>",0

Molecular Evolution of the Human Enteroviruses: Correlation of Serotype with VP1 Sequence and Application to Picornavirus Classification,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Sixty-six human enterovirus serotypes have been identified by serum neutralization, but the molecular determinants of the serotypes are unknown. Since the picornavirus VP1 protein contains a number of neutralization domains, we hypothesized that the VP1 sequence should correspond with neutralization (serotype) and, hence, with phylogenetic lineage. To test this hypothesis and to analyze the phylogenetic relationships among the human enteroviruses, we determined the complete VP1 sequences of the prototype strains of 47 human enterovirus serotypes and 10 antigenic variants. Our sequences, together with those available from GenBank, comprise a database of complete VP1 sequences for all 66 human enterovirus serotypes plus additional strains of seven serotypes. Phylogenetic trees constructed from complete VP1 sequences produced the same four major clusters as published trees based on partial VP2 sequences; in contrast to the VP2 trees, however, in the VP1 trees strains of the same serotype were always monophyletic. In pairwise comparisons of complete VP1 sequences, enteroviruses of the same serotype were clearly distinguished from those of heterologous serotypes, and the limits of intraserotypic divergence appeared to be about 25% nucleotide sequence difference or 12% amino acid sequence difference. Pairwise comparisons suggested that coxsackie A11 and A15 viruses should be classified as strains of the same serotype, as should coxsackie A13 and A18 viruses. Pairwise identity scores also distinguished between enteroviruses of different clusters and enteroviruses from picornaviruses of different genera. The data suggest that VP1 sequence comparisons may be valuable in enterovirus typing and in picornavirus taxonomy by assisting in the genus assignment of unclassified picornaviruses.</jats:p>",0

Foot-and-mouth disease in Asiatic black bears (<i>Ursus thibetanus</i>),"<jats:p> Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious, debilitating, and globally significant viral disease typically affecting cloven-hoofed hosts. The diagnosis of FMD in bears in Vietnam is described. The current study describes a confirmed case of FMD in a bear species, and the clinical signs compatible with FMD in a Malayan sun bear. Thirteen Asiatic black bears ( Ursus thibetanus) and 1 Malayan sun bear ( Helarctos malayanus) were apparently affected. In August 2011, an adult bear became lethargic, and developed footpad vesicles. Over 15 days, 14 out of 17 bears developed similar signs; the remaining 3 co-housed bears and another 57 resident bears did not. All affected bears developed vesicles on all footpads, and most were lethargic for 24–48 hr. Nasal and oral lesions were noted in 6 and 3 cases, respectively. Within 1 month, all looked normal. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, classified as serotype O, and isolated by virus isolation techniques. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clustering of 3 bear isolates, in a branch distinct from other FMDV type O isolates. The outbreak likely occurred due to indirect contact with livestock, and was facilitated by the high density of captive bears. It showed that Asiatic black bears are capable of contracting FMDV and developing clinical disease, and that the virus spreads easily between bears in close contact. </jats:p>",0
Two new subfamilies of DNA mismatch repair proteins (MutS) specifically abundant in the marine environment,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>MutS proteins are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and have important roles in DNA mismatch repair or recombination. In the virus world, the amoeba-infecting Mimivirus, as well as the recently sequenced Cafeteria roenbergensis virus are known to encode a MutS related to the homologs found in octocorals and ɛ-proteobacteria. To explore the presence of MutS proteins in other viral genomes, we performed a genomic survey of four giant viruses (‘giruses’) (Pyramimonas orientalis virus (PoV), Phaeocystis pouchetii virus (PpV), Chrysochromulina ericina virus (CeV) and Heterocapsa circularisquama DNA virus (HcDNAV)) that infect unicellular marine algae. Our analysis revealed the presence of a close homolog of Mimivirus MutS in all the analyzed giruses. These viral homologs possess a specific domain structure, including a C-terminal HNH-endonuclease domain, defining the new MutS7 subfamily. We confirmed the presence of conserved mismatch recognition residues in all members of the MutS7 subfamily, suggesting their role in DNA mismatch repair rather than DNA recombination. PoV and PpV were found to contain an additional type of MutS, which we propose to call MutS8. The MutS8 proteins in PoV and PpV were found to be closely related to homologs from ‘Candidatus Amoebophilus asiaticus’, an obligate intracellular amoeba-symbiont belonging to the Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that MutS7 and MutS8 are abundant in marine microbial metagenomes and that a vast majority of these environmental sequences are likely of girus origin. Giruses thus seem to represent a major source of the underexplored diversity of the MutS family in the microbial world.</jats:p>",0
Remarkable sequence similarity between the dinoflagellate-infecting marine girus and the terrestrial pathogen African swine fever virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:italic>Heterocapsa circularisquama</jats:italic> DNA virus (HcDNAV; previously designated as HcV) is a giant virus (girus) with a ~356-kbp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. HcDNAV lytically infects the bivalve-killing marine dinoflagellate <jats:italic>H. circularisquama</jats:italic>, and currently represents the sole DNA virus isolated from dinoflagellates, one of the most abundant protists in marine ecosystems. Its morphological features, genome type, and host range previously suggested that HcDNAV might be a member of the family <jats:italic>Phycodnaviridae</jats:italic> of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDVs), though no supporting sequence data was available. NCLDVs currently include two families found in aquatic environments (<jats:italic>Phycodnaviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Mimiviridae</jats:italic>), one mostly infecting terrestrial animals (<jats:italic>Poxviridae</jats:italic>), another isolated from fish, amphibians and insects (<jats:italic>Iridoviridae</jats:italic>), and the last one (<jats:italic>Asfarviridae</jats:italic>) exclusively represented by the animal pathogen African swine fever virus (ASFV), the agent of a fatal hemorrhagic disease in domestic swine. In this study, we determined the complete sequence of the type B DNA polymerase (PolB) gene of HcDNAV. The viral PolB was transcribed at least from 6 h post inoculation (hpi), suggesting its crucial function for viral replication. Most unexpectedly, the HcDNAV PolB sequence was found to be closely related to the PolB sequence of ASFV. In addition, the amino acid sequence of HcDNAV PolB showed a rare amino acid substitution within a motif containing highly conserved motif: Y<jats:underline>S</jats:underline> DTDS was found in HcDNAV PolB instead of Y<jats:underline>G</jats:underline> DTDS in most dsDNA viruses. Together with the previous observation of ASFV-like sequences in the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling metagenomic datasets, our results further reinforce the ideas that the terrestrial ASFV has its evolutionary origin in marine environments.</jats:p>",0
Complete genome and phylogenetic position of bovine papillomavirus type 7,"<jats:p>Six bovine papillomavirus (BPV) types and 16 putative BPV types have been reported previously. Here, the complete genome sequence of BAPV6, a novel putative BPV type isolated from cattle in Japan, was determined by using multiple-primed rolling-circle amplification. The genome consisted of 7412 bp (G+C content of 46 mol%) that encoded five early (E1, E2, E4, E6 and E7) and two late (L1 and L2) genes, but did not encode the E5 gene. The E6 protein contained a non-consensus CxxC(x)<jats:sub>33</jats:sub>CxxC and a consensus CxxC(x)<jats:sub>29</jats:sub>CxxC zinc-binding domain, and the E7 protein lacked the LxCxE motif.

The human gut virome: form and function,"<jats:p>Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies and the application of metagenomic approaches have fuelled an exponential increase in our understanding of the human gut microbiome. These approaches are now also illuminating features of the diverse and abundant collection of viruses (termed the virome) subsisting with the microbial ecosystems residing within the human holobiont. Here, we focus on the current and emerging knowledge of the human gut virome, in particular on viruses infecting bacteria (bacteriophage or phage), which are a dominant component of this viral community. We summarise current insights regarding the form and function of this ‘human gut phageome’ and highlight promising avenues for future research. In doing so, we discuss the potential for phage to drive ecological functioning and evolutionary change within this important microbial ecosystem, their contribution to modulation of host–microbiome interactions and stability of the community as a whole, as well as the potential role of the phageome in human health and disease. We also consider the emerging concepts of a ‘core healthy gut phageome’ and the putative existence of ‘viral enterotypes’ and ‘viral dysbiosis’.</jats:p>",0

Evidence of an Antigenic Shift among Palyam Serogroup Orbiviruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The Japanese isolates of Palyam serogroup viruses isolated from 1985 to 2001 were investigated for the genome sequence of segments 2 and 7 and were phylogenetically analyzed in comparison with Australian and African isolates of the same serogroup. The nucleotide sequences of segment 7 were highly conserved within Japanese isolates (95.1 to 100%) and between Japanese and Taiwanese isolates (96.0 to 100%), whereas the identities between Japanese and Taiwanese isolates and Australian and African isolates were fairly conserved (84.2 to 92.0%). Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 7 revealed three clusters according to geographical origin. As a result of the nucleotide sequence analysis of segment 2, which encodes a serotype-specific antigen, Japanese isolates were classified into two groups by genome length and nucleotide identities. Four of the nine Japanese isolates were categorized into the same group as prototype strain K-47 of the Chuzan virus, and the remaining isolates were categorized into the same group as the D'Aguilar virus and Nyabira virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 2 revealed two clusters, the cluster containing Chuzan virus and the cluster containing the D'Aguilar and Nyabira viruses. To examine the antigenic relationship among viruses categorized in different clusters, we conducted a cross-neutralization test. KSB-29/E/01, isolated in 2001 in Japan, was neutralized by antiserum not only to strain B8112 of D'Aguilar virus but also to Chuzan virus. These results indicated that genetically and antigenically unique characteristics of KSB-29/E/01 were attributed to genetic reassortment of segment 2 between Chuzan virus and D'Aguilar virus.</jats:p>",0

Porcine B-cells recognize epitopes that are conserved between the structural proteins of American- and European-type porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus,"<jats:p>By selecting phage display libraries with immune sera from experimentally infected pigs, porcine B-cell epitopes in the open reading frame (ORF) 2, 3, 5 and 6 proteins of European-type porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were identified. The sequences of all the epitopes were well conserved in European-type PRRSV and even between European- and American-type PRRSV. Accordingly, sera from pigs infected with American-type PRRSV cross-reacted with the European-type epitopes. Thus, this study showed, for the first time, the presence of highly conserved epitopes in the matrix protein and envelope glycoproteins of PRRSV. ORF5 and 6 epitopes localized to protein parts that are predicted to be hidden in PRRSV virions. In contrast, ORF2 and 3 epitopes localized to putative protein ectodomains. Due to the interesting localization, the sequence surrounding the ORF2 and 3 epitopes was subjected to closer scrutiny. A heptad motif, VSRRIYQ, which is present in a single copy in ORF2 and 3 proteins, was identified; this arrangement is completely conserved in all European-type PRRSV sequences available. The VSRRIYQ repeat motif colocalized closely with one of the ORF2 epitopes and secondary structure modelling showed that this segment of the ORF2 protein could form an amphipathic helix. Intriguingly, a mutation associated with virulence/attenuation of an American vaccine strain of PRRSV also localized to this ORF2 protein segment and affected the hydrophobic face of the predicted amphipathic helix. Further work is needed to determine whether these findings delineate a functional domain in the PRRSV ORF2 protein.</jats:p>",0

Genetic changes in pigeon paramyxovirus type-1 induced by serial passages in chickens and microscopic lesions caused by the virus in various avian hosts,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>

                  <jats:bold>Introduction:</jats:bold> Genotype VI of avian avulavirus 1 (AAvV-1) has pigeons and doves as its reservoir and is often termed pigeon paramyxovirus type-1 (PPMV-1). The pathogenesis of PPMV-1 infections in poultry is largely obscure. It is known that PPMV-1 requires a series of passages in chickens before it becomes adapted to gallinaceous poultry.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>
                  <jats:bold>Material and Methods:</jats:bold> Changes in the genome of PPMV-1 were analysed after serial passages in specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens, using high-throughput sequencing. Additionally, histopathological lesions induced by PPMV-1 in experimentally inoculated pigeons, chickens, and turkeys were evaluated.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>
                  <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Following six passages of PPMV-1 in chickens, 10 nonsynonymous substitutions were found including one (in the NP protein) which dominated the genetic pool of viral quasispecies.

Host-independent evolution and a genetic classification of the hepadnavirus family based on nucleotide sequences.,"<jats:p>An analysis of molecular phylogeny was undertaken to examine whether the evolution of the hepadnavirus family is host-dependent. Using the nucleotide sequences of 18 strains, we constructed phylogenetic trees. The trees obtained show that all 12 strains of hepatitis B virus can be classified into four subgroups that are not compatible with conventional subtypes. We estimated the rate of synonymous (silent) substitution for hepatitis B virus to be 4.57 x 10(-5) per site per year. Applying this rate to the phylogenetic tree, we estimated that duck hepatitis B virus diverged from a common ancestor about 30,000 years ago at the earliest, that woodchuck hepatitis virus and ground squirrel hepatitis virus diverged about 10,000 years ago, and that hepatitis B virus diverged within the last 3000 years. Because these divergence times of the viruses are much more recent than those of the host species, it suggests that the hepadnavirus family evolved independently of host-species divergence.</jats:p>",0

Genetic and epidemiological insights into the emergence of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) across Asia and Africa,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Small ruminants are important components in the livelihood of millions of households in many parts of the world. The spread of the highly contagious peste des petits ruminants (PPR) disease, which is caused by an RNA virus, PPRV, across Asia and Africa remains a major concern. The present study explored the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of PPRV through the analyses of partial N-gene and F-gene sequences of the virus. All the four previously described PPRV lineages (I-IV) diverged from their common ancestor during the late-19<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>to early-20<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>century. Among the four lineages, PPRV-IV showed pronounced genetic structuring across the region; however, haplotype sharing among the geographic regions, together with the presence of multiple genetic clusters within a country, indicates the possibility of frequent mobility of the diseased individuals across the region. The gradual decline in the effective number of infections suggests a limited genetic variation, which could be attributed to the effective vaccination that has been practiced since 1990s. However, the movement of infected animals across the region likely contributes to the spread of PPRV-IV. No evidence of positive selection was identified from this study.</jats:p>",0

A Novel Porcine Circovirus Distantly Related to Known Circoviruses Is Associated with Porcine Dermatitis and Nephropathy Syndrome and Reproductive Failure,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) is clinically manifested by postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), respiratory and enteric disease, reproductive failure, and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an essential component of PCVAD, although an etiologic role in PDNS is not well established. Here, a novel circovirus, designated porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3), was identified in sows that died acutely with PDNS-like clinical signs. The capsid and replicase proteins of PCV3 are only 37% and 55% identical to PCV2 and bat circoviruses, respectively. Aborted fetuses from sows with PDNS contained high levels of PCV3 (7.57 × 10
            <jats:sup>7</jats:sup>
            genome copies/ml), and no other viruses were detected by PCR and metagenomic sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of sow tissue samples identified PCV3 antigen in skin, kidney, lung, and lymph node samples localized in typical PDNS lesions, including necrotizing vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Further study of archived PDNS tissue samples that were negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis identified 45 of 48 that were PCV3 positive by quantitative PCR (qPCR), with 60% of a subset also testing positive for PCV3 by IHC analysis. Analysis by qPCR of 271 porcine respiratory disease diagnostic submission samples identified 34 PCV3-positive cases (12.5%), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of anti-PCV3 capsid antibodies in serum samples found that 46 (55%) of 83 samples tested were positive. These results suggest that PCV3 commonly circulates within U.S. swine and may play an etiologic role in reproductive failure and PDNS. Because of the high economic impact of PCV2, this novel circovirus warrants further studies to elucidate its significance and role in PCVAD.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            While porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) was first identified in sporadic cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in Canada in the early 1990s, an epidemic of severe systemic disease due to PCV2 spread worldwide in the ensuing decade. Despite being effectively controlled by commercial vaccines, PCV2 remains one of the most economically significant viruses of swine. Here, a novel porcine circovirus (PCV3) that is distantly related to known circoviruses was identified in sows with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) and reproductive failure. PCV2, which has previously been associated with these clinical presentations, was not identified. High levels of PCV3 nucleic acid were observed in aborted fetuses by quantitative PCR, and PCV3 antigen was localized in histologic lesions typical of PDNS in sows by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. PCV3 was also identified in archival PDNS diagnostic samples that previously tested negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis. The emergence of PCV3 warrants further investigation.

Genomic diversity and adaptation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium from analysis of six genomes of different phage types,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>
              <jats:italic>Salmonella enterica</jats:italic> serovar Typhimurium (or simply Typhimurium) is the most common serovar in both human infections and farm animals in Australia and many other countries. Typhimurium is a broad host range serovar but has also evolved into host-adapted variants (i.e. isolated from a particular host such as pigeons). Six Typhimurium strains of different phage types (defined by patterns of susceptibility to lysis by a set of bacteriophages) were analysed using Illumina high-throughput genome sequencing.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Variations between strains were mainly due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an average of 611 SNPs per strain, ranging from 391 SNPs to 922 SNPs. There were seven insertions/deletions (indels) involving whole or partial gene deletions, four inactivation events due to IS<jats:italic>200</jats:italic> insertion and 15 pseudogenes due to early termination. Four of these inactivated or deleted genes may be virulence related. Nine prophage or prophage remnants were identified in the six strains. Gifsy-1, Gifsy-2 and the <jats:italic>sopE2</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>sspH2</jats:italic> phage remnants were present in all six genomes while Fels-1, Fels-2, ST64B, ST104 and CP4-57 were variably present. Four strains carried the 90-kb plasmid pSLT which contains several known virulence genes. However, two strains were found to lack the plasmid. In addition, one strain had a novel plasmid similar to Typhi strain CT18 plasmid pHCM2.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The genome data suggest that variations between strains were mainly due to accumulation of SNPs, some of which resulted in gene inactivation. Unique genetic elements that were common between host-adapted phage types were not found. This study advanced our understanding on the evolution and adaptation of Typhimurium at genomic level.</jats:p>

Development of cDNA probes for typing group A bovine rotaviruses on the basis of VP4 specificity,"<jats:p>Dot and Northern (RNA) blot hybridization assays were developed for the P typing of group A bovine rotaviruses (BRV) by using cDNA probes prepared from gene segment 4. The probes were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of hyperdivergent regions (nucleotides 211 to 686) of BRV strain UK, IND, NCDV, and Cr VP4 cDNA by using specific oligonucleotide primers. The probes were P type specific (VP4) and exhibited little or no cross-reactivity with double-stranded RNA from heterologous rotavirus P types. Our studies indicate that at least three P types, as defined by polymerase chain reaction-derived VP4 gene probes from the UK, NCDV, and Cr strains, exist among the seven BRV isolates tested.</jats:p>",0

"Options for control of foot-and-mouth disease: knowledge, capability and policy","<jats:p>Foot-and-mouth disease can be controlled by zoo-sanitary measures and vaccination but this is difficult owing to the existence of multiple serotypes of the causative virus, multiple host species including wildlife and extreme contagiousness. Although intolerable to modern high-production livestock systems, the disease is not usually fatal and often not a priority for control in many developing countries, which remain reservoirs for viral dissemination. Phylogenetic analysis of the viruses circulating worldwide reveals seven principal reservoirs, each requiring a tailored regional control strategy. Considerable trade benefits accrue to countries that eradicate the disease but as well as requiring regional cooperation, achieving and maintaining this status using current tools takes a great deal of time, money and effort. Therefore, a progressive approach is needed that can provide interim benefits along the pathway to final eradication. Research is needed to understand and predict the patterns of viral persistence and emergence and to improve vaccine selection. Better diagnostic methods and especially better vaccines could significantly improve control in both the free and the affected parts of the world. In particular, vaccines with improved thermostability and a longer duration of immunity would facilitate control and make it less reliant on advanced veterinary infrastructures.</jats:p>",0

"Isolation of a bovine rotavirus with a ""super-short"" RNA electrophoretic pattern from a calf with diarrhea","<jats:p>A rotavirus with a ""super-short"" RNA electropherotype was isolated from a calf with diarrhea and was designated VMRI strain. Segments 10 and 11 of this rotavirus migrated more slowly than did those of bovine rotavirus strains NCDV, B641, and B223. The electrophoretic pattern of the VMRI strain was similar to that reported for rotaviruses with super-short RNA electropherotypes from humans and rabbits. Northern (RNA) blot hybridization indicated that gene 11 of the VMRI strain was altered and migrated between gene segments 9 and 10. The subgroup of the VMRI strain was shown to be subgroup I. The VMRI strain of bovine rotavirus was neutralized by antisera containing polyclonal antibodies to rotavirus serotype 6 (bovine rotavirus serotype I) strains NCDV and B641 and by ascitic fluid containing monoclonal antibodies directed to VP7 of serotype 6 rotavirus. The VMRI strain was not neutralized by either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to strain B223 (bovine rotavirus serotype II). Collective data on the neutralization of the VMRI strain with monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies suggest that this virus is a member of the NCDV group (serotype 6) of rotaviruses (bovine rotavirus serotype I).</jats:p>",0

Viral recombination blurs taxonomic lines: examination of single-stranded DNA viruses in a wastewater treatment plant,"<jats:p>Understanding the structure and dynamics of microbial communities, especially those of economic concern, is of paramount importance to maintaining healthy and efficient microbial communities at agricultural sites and large industrial cultures, including bioprocessors. Wastewater treatment plants are large bioprocessors which receive water from multiple sources, becoming reservoirs for the collection of many viral families that infect a broad range of hosts. To examine this complex collection of viruses, full-length genomes of circular ssDNA viruses were isolated from a wastewater treatment facility using a combination of sucrose-gradient size selection and rolling-circle amplification and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Single-stranded DNA viruses are among the least understood groups of microbial pathogens due to genomic biases and culturing difficulties, particularly compared to the larger, more often studied dsDNA viruses. However, the group contains several notable well-studied examples, including agricultural pathogens which infect both livestock and crops (<jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Geminiviridae</jats:italic>), and model organisms for genetics and evolution studies (<jats:italic>Microviridae</jats:italic>). Examination of the collected viral DNA provided evidence for 83 unique genotypic groupings, which were genetically dissimilar to known viral types and exhibited broad diversity within the community. Furthermore, although these genomes express similarities to known viral families, such as<jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Geminiviridae</jats:italic>, and<jats:italic>Microviridae</jats:italic>, many are so divergent that they may represent new taxonomic groups. This study demonstrated the efficacy of the protocol for separating bacteria and large viruses from the sought after ssDNA viruses and the ability to use this protocol to obtain an in-depth analysis of the diversity within this group.</jats:p>",0

Phylogenetic Relationships among Virulent Newcastle Disease Virus Isolates from the 2002-2003 Outbreak in California and Other Recent Outbreaks in North America,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Isolates from the 2002-2003 virulent Newcastle disease virus (v-NDV) outbreak in southern California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas in the United States were compared to each other along with recent v-NDV isolates from Mexico and Central America and reference avian paramyxovirus type 1 strains. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were conducted on a 1,195-base genomic segment composing the 3′ region of the matrix (M) protein gene and a 5′ portion of the fusion (F) protein gene including the M-F intergenic region. This encompasses coding sequences for the nuclear localization signal of the M protein and the F protein cleavage activation site. A dibasic amino acid motif was present at the predicted F protein cleavage activation site in all v-NDVs, including the California 2002-2003, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Mexico, and Central America isolates. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the California 2002-2003, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas viruses were most closely related to isolates from Mexico and Central America. An isolate from Texas obtained during 2003 appeared to represent a separate introduction of v-NDV into the United States, as this virus was even more closely related to the Mexico 2000 isolates than the California, Arizona, and Nevada viruses. The close phylogenetic relationship between the recent 2002-2003 U.S. v-NDV isolates and those viruses from countries geographically close to the United States warrants continued surveillance of commercial and noncommercial poultry for early detection of highly virulent NDV.</jats:p>",0

Cocirculation of Avian H9N2 and Contemporary “Human” H3N2 Influenza A Viruses in Pigs in Southeastern China: Potential for Genetic Reassortment?,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Pigs are permissive to both human and avian influenza viruses and have been proposed to be an intermediate host for the genesis of pandemic influenza viruses through reassortment or adaptation of avian viruses. Prospective virological surveillance carried out between March 1998 and June 2000 in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China, on pigs imported from southeastern China, provides the first evidence of interspecies transmission of avian H9N2 viruses to pigs and documents their cocirculation with contemporary human H3N2 (A/Sydney/5/97-like, Sydney97-like) viruses. All gene segments of the porcine H9N2 viruses were closely related to viruses similar to chicken/Beijing/1/94 (H9N2), duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 (H9N2), and the descendants of the latter virus lineage. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that repeated interspecies transmission events had occurred from the avian host to pigs. The Sydney97-like (H3N2) viruses isolated from pigs were related closely to contemporary human H3N2 viruses in all gene segments and had not undergone genetic reassortment. Cocirculation of avian H9N2 and human H3N2 viruses in pigs provides an opportunity for genetic reassortment leading to the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential.</jats:p>",0

Conserved presence of G-quadruplex forming sequences in the Long Terminal Repeat Promoter of Lentiviruses,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>G-quadruplexes (G4s) are secondary structures of nucleic acids that epigenetically regulate cellular processes. In the human immunodeficiency lentivirus 1 (HIV-1), dynamic G4s are located in the unique viral LTR promoter. Folding of HIV-1 LTR G4s inhibits viral transcription; stabilization by G4 ligands intensifies this effect. Cellular proteins modulate viral transcription by inducing/unfolding LTR G4s. We here expanded our investigation on the presence of LTR G4s to all lentiviruses. G4s in the 5′-LTR U3 region were completely conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a cattle-infecting lentivirus. All other non-primate lentiviruses displayed hints of less stable G4s. In primate lentiviruses, the possibility to fold into G4s was highly conserved among strains. LTR G4 sequences were very similar among phylogenetically related primate viruses, while they increasingly differed in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation between primate lentivirus LTR G4s and Sp1/NFκB binding sites was found. All LTR G4s folded: their complexity was assessed by polymerase stop assay. Our data support a role of the lentiviruses 5′-LTR G4 region as control centre of viral transcription, where folding/unfolding of G4s and multiple recruitment of factors based on both sequence and structure may take place.</jats:p>",0
Comparison and contrast of genes and biological pathways responding to Marek’s disease virus infection using allele-specific expression and differential expression in broiler and layer chickens,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>

            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Marek’s disease (MD) is a commercially important neoplastic disease of chickens caused by the Marek’s disease virus (MDV), a naturally occurring oncogenic alphaherpesvirus. Enhancing MD genetic resistance is desirable to augment current vaccines and other MD control measures. High throughput sequencing was used to profile splenic transcriptomes from individual F<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> progeny infected with MDV at 4 days of age from both outbred broilers (meat-type) and inbred layer (egg-type) chicken lines that differed in MD genetic resistance. The resulting information was used to identify SNPs, genes, and biological pathways exhibiting allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection in each type of chicken. In addition, we compared and contrasted the results of pathway analyses (ASE and differential expression (DE)) between chicken types to help inform on the biological response to MDV infection.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>With 7 individuals per line and treatment group providing high power, we identified 6,132 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4,768 genes and 4,528 SNPs in 3,718 genes in broilers and layers, respectively, that exhibited ASE in response to MDV infection. Furthermore, 548 and 434 genes in broilers and layers, respectively, were found to show DE following MDV infection. Comparing the datasets, only 72 SNPs and 850 genes for ASE and 20 genes for DE were common between the two bird types. Although the chicken types used in this study were genetically different, at the pathway level, both TLR receptor and JAK/STAT signaling pathways were enriched as well as exhibiting a high proportion of ASE genes, especially at the beginning of both above mentioned regulatory pathways.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>RNA sequencing with adequate biological replicates is a powerful approach to identify high confidence SNPs, genes, and pathways that are associated with transcriptional response to MDV infection. In addition, the SNPs exhibiting ASE in response to MDV infection provide a strong foundation for determining the extent to which variation in expression influences MD incidence plus yield genetic markers for genomic selection. However, given the paucity of overlap among ASE SNP sets (broilers vs. layers), it is likely that separate screens need to be incorporated for each population. Finally, comparison of gene lists obtained between these two diverse chicken types indicate the TLR and JAK/STAT signaling are conserved when responding to MDV infection and may be altered by selection of genes exhibiting ASE found at the start of each pathway.</jats:p>

A third gyrovirus species in human faeces,"<jats:p>Until 2011 the genus <jats:italic>Gyrovirus</jats:italic> in the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic> consisted of a single virus (Chicken anemia virus or CAV) causing a common immunosuppressive disease in chickens when a second gyrovirus (HGyV) was reported on the skin of 4 % of healthy humans. HGyV is very closely related to a recently described chicken gyrovirus, AGV2, suggesting that they belong to the same viral species. During a viral metagenomic analysis of 100 human faeces from children with diarrhoea in Chile we identified multiple known human pathogens (adenoviruses, enteroviruses, astroviruses, sapoviruses, noroviruses, parechoviruses and rotaviruses) and a novel gyrovirus species we named GyV3 sharing &lt;63 % similarity with other gyrovirus proteins with evidence of recombination with CAV in its UTR. <jats:italic>Gyroviridae</jats:italic> consensus PCR revealed a high prevalence of CAV DNA in diarrhoea and normal faeces from Chilean children and faeces of USA cats and dogs, which may reflect consumption of CAV-infected/vaccinated chickens.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of a novel circovirus of canaries and its relationship to other members of the genus Circovirus of the family Circoviridae,"<jats:p>The circular, single-stranded DNA genome of a novel circovirus of canaries, tentatively named canary circovirus (CaCV), was cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis indicated that the genome was 1952 nucleotides (nt) in size and had the potential to encode three viral proteins, including the putative capsid and replication-associated (Rep) proteins. The CaCV genome shared greatest sequence similarity (58·3% nt identity) with the newly characterized columbid circovirus (CoCV) and was more distantly related to the two porcine circovirus strains, PCV1 and PCV2, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) and a recently isolated goose circovirus (GCV) isolate (46·8–50·9% nt identity). In common with other members of the <jats:italic>Circovirus</jats:italic> genus, several nt structures and amino acid motifs thought to be implicated in virus replication were identified on the putative viral strand. Phylogenetic analysis of both the capsid and Rep protein-coding regions provided further evidence that CaCV is more closely related to CoCV and BFDV and more distantly related to GCV, PCV1 and PCV2.</jats:p>",0

Low-pathogenic avian influenza virus A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) is the progenitor of highly pathogenic A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9),"<jats:p>The first confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus infections in North America was caused by A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9); however, the phylogeny of this virus is largely unknown. This study performed genomic sequence analysis of 11 avian influenza isolates from 1956 to 1979 for comparison with A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9). Phylogenetic and genetic analyses included these viruses in combination with all known full-genome sequences of avian viruses isolated before 1981. It was shown that a low-pathogenic avian influenza virus, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1), that had been isolated 3 months previously, was the closest known genetic relative with six genome segments of common lineage encoding the polymerase subunits PB2, PB1 and PA, nucleoprotein (NP), haemagglutinin (HA) and non-structural (NS) proteins. The lineages of these genome segments included reassortment with other North American turkey viruses that were all rooted in North American wild waterfowl with the HA gene originating from the H5N2 serotype. The phylogenies demonstrated adaptation from North American wild birds to turkeys with the possible involvement of domestic waterfowl. The turkey isolate, A/turkey/Wisconsin/1968 (H5N9), was the second most closely related poultry isolate to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9), possessing five common lineage genome segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA and neuraminidase). The A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) virus was more virulent than A/turkey/Wisconsin/68 (H5N9) for chicken embryos and mice, indicating a greater biological similarity to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9). Thus, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) was identified as the closest known ancestral relative of HPAI A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9), which will serve as a useful reference virus for characterizing the early genetic and biological properties associated with the emergence of pathogenic avian influenza strains.</jats:p>",0

Influenza A Viruses Detected in Swine in Southern Germany after the H1N1 Pandemic in 2009,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Infections with influenza A viruses (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content>) are highly prevalent in swine populations, and stable cocirculation of at least three lineages has been well documented in European swine – till 2009. However, since the emergence of the human pandemic pdmH1N1 virus in 2009, which has been (re)introduced into individual swine herds worldwide, the situation has been changing. These variations in the respective <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> pools within pig populations are of major interest, and the zoonotic potential of putative emerging viruses needs to be evaluated. As data on recent <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> in swine from southern Germany were relatively sparse, the purpose of this study was to determine the major <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> subtypes actually present in this region. To this aim, from 2010 to 2013, 1417 nasal swabs or lung tissue samples from pigs with respiratory disease were screened for <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> genomes. Overall, in 130 holdings <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> genomes were detected by real‐time <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">RT</jats:styled-content>‐<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PCR</jats:styled-content> targeting the matrix protein gene. For further analyses, several <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PCR</jats:styled-content> protocols were adapted to quickly subtype between H1, pdmH1, H3, N1 and N2 sequences. Taken together, cocirculation of the three stable European lineages of <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> was confirmed for Bavaria. H1N1 sequences were identified in 59, whereas H1N2 genomes were only diagnosed in 14, and H3N2 in 9 of the holdings analysed. However, pdmH1 in combination with N1 was detected in 2010, 2012 and 2013 confirming a presence, albeit in low prevalence, likewise pdmH1N2 reassortant viruses. Interestingly, individual cases of coinfections with more than one subtype were diagnosed. Partial genome sequences were determined and phylogenetic analyses performed. Clearly other than in the human population classically circulating <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IAV</jats:styled-content> have not been displaced by pdmH1N1 in Bavarian swine. However, some interesting viruses were detected. Further surveillance of these viruses in the Bavarian pig population will be of major importance, to monitor future developments.</jats:p>",0

High turnover drives prolonged persistence of influenza in managed pig herds,"<jats:p>Pigs have long been hypothesized to play a central role in the emergence of novel human influenza A virus (IAV) strains, by serving as mixing vessels for mammalian and avian variants. However, the key issue of viral persistence in swine populations at different scales is ill understood. We address this gap using epidemiological models calibrated against seroprevalence data from Dutch finishing pigs to estimate the ‘critical herd size’ (CHS) for IAV persistence. We then examine the viral phylogenetic evidence for persistence by comparing human and swine IAV. Models suggest a CHS of approximately 3000 pigs above which influenza was likely to persist, i.e. orders of magnitude lower than persistence thresholds for IAV and other acute viruses in humans. At national and regional scales, we found much stronger empirical signatures of prolonged persistence of IAV in swine compared with human populations. These striking levels of persistence in small populations are driven by the high recruitment rate of susceptible piglets, and have significant implications for management of swine and for overall patterns of genetic diversity of IAV.</jats:p>",0

Viral shedders in a herd vaccinated against infection with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) without prior testing for the presence of persistently infected animals,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Introduction: Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), caused by the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), is one of the most important diseases of cattle worldwide. The purpose of the study was to determine the BVDV infection status in a dairy herd vaccinated against BVD. Before vaccination started in 2008, there had been no prior identification or the removal of the possible source of infection (persistently infected animals). It was expected that vaccination itself would enable the elimination of viral shedders on a long term basis. Material and Methods: Serological screening for antibodies against BVDV with determination for antibodies titres, BVDV antigen, and the presence of the viral genome with phylogenetic analysis of positive samples in the herd were performed, despite the lack of any clinical problems indicating possible presence of BVDV infection. Results: 19 individuals persistently infected with BVDV were identified among calves and heifers but not in adult cattle. All virus shedders were antibody negative and the genotype of isolated virus was BVDV-1b, indicating a single source of infection. The vaccine used in the herd was composed of BVDV-1a strain. In each of the tested cowsheds, antibody titres against BVDV-1b were higher than against BVDV-1a (median values). Conclusion: Despite a long-lasting vaccination programme and relatively high sequence homology of vaccinal and field strains of BVDV (83.6%), it was not possible to avoid transplacental infections of foetuses and the birth of persistently infected calves from vaccinated heifers although the protection against clinical disease was accomplished.</jats:p>",0

Describing the Silent Human Virome with an Emphasis on Giant Viruses,"<jats:p>Viruses are the most abundant obligate intracellular entities in our body. Until recently, they were only considered to be pathogens that caused a broad array of pathologies, ranging from mild disease to deaths in the most severe cases. However, recent advances in unbiased mass sequencing techniques as well as increasing epidemiological evidence have indicated that the human body is home to diverse viral species under non-pathological conditions. Despite these studies, the description of the presumably healthy viral flora, i.e. the normal human virome, is still in its infancy regarding viral composition and dynamics. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the human virome under non-pathological conditions.</jats:p>",0

New Hepatitis B Virus of Cranes That Has an Unexpected Broad Host Range,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>All hepadnaviruses known so far have a very limited host range, restricted to their natural hosts and a few closely related species. This is thought to be due mainly to sequence divergence in the large envelope protein and species-specific differences in host components essential for virus propagation. Here we report an infection of cranes with a novel hepadnavirus, designated CHBV, that has an unexpectedly broad host range and is only distantly evolutionarily related to avihepadnaviruses of related hosts. Direct DNA sequencing of amplified CHBV DNA as well a sequencing of cloned viral genomes revealed that CHBV is most closely related to, although distinct from, Ross' goose hepatitis B virus (RGHBV) and slightly less closely related to duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). Phylogenetically, cranes are very distant from geese and ducks and are most closely related to herons and storks. Naturally occurring hepadnaviruses in the last two species are highly divergent in sequence from RGHBV and DHBV and do not infect ducks or do so only marginally. In contrast, CHBV from crane sera and recombinant CHBV produced from LMH cells infected primary duck hepatocytes almost as efficiently as DHBV did. This is the first report of a rather broad host range of an avihepadnavirus. Our data imply either usage of similar or identical entry pathways and receptors by DHBV and CHBV, unusual host and virus adaptation mechanisms, or divergent evolution of the host genomes and cellular components required for virus propagation.</jats:p>",0

The ecology and age structure of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus outbreak in wild mute swans,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The first UK epizootic of highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 influenza in wild birds occurred in 2008, in a population of mute swans that had been the subject of ornithological study for decades. Here we use an innovative combination of ornithological, phylogenetic and immunological approaches to investigate the ecology and age structure of HP H5N1 in nature. We screened samples from swans and waterbirds using PCR and sequenced HP H5N1-positive samples. The outbreak's origin was investigated by linking bird count data with a molecular clock analysis of sampled virus sequences. We used ringing records to reconstruct the age-structure of outbreak mortality, and we estimated the age distribution of prior exposure to avian influenza. Outbreak mortality was low and all HP H5N1-positive mute swans in the affected population were &lt;3 years old. Only the youngest age classes contained an appreciable number of individuals with no detectable antibody responses to viral nucleoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the outbreak strain circulated locally for ∼1 month before detection and arrived when the immigration rate of migrant waterbirds was highest. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that HP H5N1 epizootics in wild swans exhibit limited mortality due to immune protection arising from previous exposure. Our study population may represent a valuable resource for investigating the natural ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza.</jats:p>",0

Identification of Genes Critical for Resistance to Infection by West Nile Virus Using RNA-Seq Analysis,"<jats:p>The West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging infection of biodefense concern and there are no available treatments or vaccines. Here we used a high-throughput method based on a novel gene expression analysis, RNA-Seq, to give a global picture of differential gene expression by primary human macrophages of 10 healthy donors infected in vitro with WNV. From a total of 28 million reads per sample, we identified 1,514 transcripts that were differentially expressed after infection. Both predicted and novel gene changes were detected, as were gene isoforms, and while many of the genes were expressed by all donors, some were unique. Knock-down of genes not previously known to be associated with WNV resistance identified their critical role in control of viral infection. Our study distinguishes both common gene pathways as well as novel cellular responses. Such analyses will be valuable for translational studies of susceptible and resistant individuals—and for targeting therapeutics—in multiple biological settings.</jats:p>",0

"Viral communities associated with porcine respiratory disease complex in intensive commercial farms in Sichuan province, China","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), a common piglet disease, causes substantive economic losses in pig farming. To investigate the viral diversity associated with PRDC, the viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 PRDC-affected piglets were investigated using metagenomics. By deep sequencing and <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> assembly, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but most viruses comprised small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque teno sus virus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC. These results illustrate the complexity of viral communities in the PRDC-affected piglets and highlight the candidate viruses associated with it.</jats:p>",0

            <jats:p>Phylogenetic trees of eight gene segments showed that viruses sampled from human formed a well-supported clade, whereas swine and avian lineages were intermixed together. A new divergence swine sublineage containing gene segments of 2009 H1N1 viruses was characterized, which were closely related with swine viruses collected from USA and South Korea during 2004 to 2007 in six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS), and to swine viruses isolated from Thailand during 2004 to 2005 in NA and M. Substitution rates were varied drastically among eight segments and the average substitution rate was generally higher in 2009 H1N1 than in swine and human viruses (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic>

            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Our results implied that at least four reassortments or transmissions probably occurred before 2009 H1N1 viruses. Initial reassortment arose in 1976 and avian-like Eurasian swine viruses emerged. The second transmission happened in Asia and North America between 1988 and 1992, and mostly influenced six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS). The third reassortment occurred between North American swine and avian viruses during 1998 to 2000, which involved PB2 and PA segments. Recent reassortments occurred among avian-to-swine reassortant, Eurasian and classical swine viruses during 2004 to 2005. South Korea, Thailand and USA, were identified as locations where reassortments most likely happened. The co-circulation of multiple swine sublineages and special lifestyle in Asia might have facilitated mixing of diverse influenza viruses, leading to generate a novel virus strain.</jats:p>

Genome Dynamics and Molecular Infection Epidemiology of Multidrug-Resistant Helicobacter pullorum Isolates Obtained from Broiler and Free-Range Chickens in India,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Some life-threatening, foodborne, and zoonotic infections are transmitted through poultry birds. Inappropriate and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in the livestock industry has led to an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria with epidemic potential. Here, we present a functional molecular epidemiological analysis entailing the phenotypic and whole-genome sequence-based characterization of 11
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            isolates from broiler and free-range chickens sampled from retail wet markets in Hyderabad City, India. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed all of the isolates to be resistant to multiple antibiotic classes such as fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, and macrolides. The isolates were also found to be extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers and were even resistant to clavulanic acid. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of these isolates revealed the presence of five or six well-characterized antimicrobial resistance genes, including those encoding a resistance-nodulation-division efflux pump(s). Phylogenetic analysis combined with pan-genome analysis revealed a remarkable degree of genetic diversity among the isolates from free-range chickens; in contrast, a high degree of genetic similarity was observed among broiler chicken isolates. Comparative genomic analysis of all publicly available
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            genomes, including our isolates (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 16), together with the genomes of 17 other
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Helicobacter</jats:named-content>
            species, revealed a high number (8,560) of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            -specific protein-encoding genes, with an average of 535 such genes per isolate.
            <jats:italic>In silico</jats:italic>
            virulence screening identified 182 important virulence genes and also revealed high strain-specific gene content in isolates from free-range chickens (average, 34) compared to broiler chicken isolates. A significant prevalence of prophages (ranging from 1 to 9) and a significant presence of genomic islands (0 to 4) were observed in free-range and broiler chicken isolates. Taken together, these observations provide significant baseline data for functional molecular infection epidemiology of nonpyloric
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Helicobacter</jats:named-content>
            species such as

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Globally, the poultry industry is expanding with an ever-growing consumer base for chicken meat. Given this, food-associated transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria represents an important health care issue. Our study involves a critical baseline approach directed at genome sequence-based epidemiology and transmission dynamics of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            , a poultry pathogen having established zoonotic potential. We believe our studies would facilitate the development of surveillance systems that ensure the safety of food for humans and guide public health policies related to the use of antibiotics in animal feed in countries such as India. We sequenced 11 new genomes of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            as a part of this study. These genomes would provide much value in addition to the ongoing comparative genomic studies of helicobacters.

Genetic Characterization of the Belgian Nephropathogenic Infectious Bronchitis Virus (NIBV) Reference Strain B1648,"<jats:p>The virulent nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) strain B1648 was first isolated in 1984, in Flanders, Belgium. Despite intensive vaccination, B1648 and its variants are still circulating in Europe and North Africa. Here, the full-length genome of this Belgian NIBV reference strain was determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) to understand its evolutionary relationship with other IBV strains, and to identify possible genetic factors that may be associated with the nephropathogenicity. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in the B1648 strain (51UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-31UTR). ORFs 4b, 4c and 6b, which have been rarely reported in literature, were present in B1648 and most of the other IBV complete genomes. According to phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome, replicase transcriptase complex, spike protein, partial S1 gene and M protein, B1648 strain clustered with the non-Massachusetts type strains NGA/A116E7/2006, UKr 27-11, QX-like ITA/90254/2005, QX-like CK/SWE/0658946/10, TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05. Based on the partial S1 fragment, B1648 clustered with the strains TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05 and, further designated as B1648 genotype. The full-length genome of B1648 shared the highest sequence homology with UKr 27-11, Gray, JMK, and NGA/A116E7/2006 (91.2% to 91.6%) and was least related with the reference Beaudette and Massachusetts strains (89.7%). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses indicated that B1648 strain may have played an important role in the evolution of IBV in Europe and North Africa. Further, the nephropathogenicity determinants might be located on the 1a, spike, M and accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b). Overall, strain B1648 is distinct from all the strains reported so far in Europe and other parts of the world.</jats:p>",0

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Acanthamoeba</jats:named-content>
            spp. Their isolation in humans suggests that they are part of the human virome. Using a high-throughput strategy to isolate new giant viruses from their original protozoan hosts, we obtained eight isolates of a new giant viral lineage from
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Vermamoeba</jats:named-content>
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">vermiformis</jats:named-content>
            , the most common free-living protist found in human environments. This new lineage was proposed to be the faustovirus lineage. The prototype member, faustovirus E12, forms icosahedral virions of ≈200 nm that are devoid of fibrils and that encapsidate a 466-kbp genome encoding 451 predicted proteins. Of these, 164 are found in the virion. Phylogenetic analysis of the core viral genes showed that faustovirus is distantly related to the mammalian pathogen African swine fever virus, but it encodes ≈3 times more mosaic gene complements. About two-thirds of these genes do not show significant similarity to genes encoding any known proteins. These findings show that expanding the panel of protists to discover new giant viruses is a fruitful strategy.

Kobuviruses – a comprehensive review,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Kobuviruses are members of the large and growing family <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>. Until now, two official, <jats:italic>Aichi virus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Bovine kobuvirus,</jats:italic> and one candidate kobuvirus species, ‘porcine kobuvirus’, have been identified in human, cattle and swine, respectively. In addition, kobu‐like viruses were detected very recently in the bat. Aichi virus could be one of the causative agents of gastroenteritis in humans, and kobuviruses probably also cause diarrhoea in cattle and swine. Although Aichi virus has been detected relatively infrequently (0–3%) in human diarrhoea, high seroprevalence, up to 80–95% at the age of 30–40, was found indicating the general nature of infection in different human populations. In the previous years, much new information has accumulated relating to kobuviruses and their host species. This review summarises the current knowledge on kobuviruses including taxonomy, biology and viral characteristics, and covers all aspects of infection including epidemiology, clinical picture, host species diversity, laboratory diagnosis and it gives a summary about possible future perspectives.

Stability of the Parainfluenza Virus 5 Genome Revealed by Deep Sequencing of Strains Isolated from Different Hosts and following Passage in Cell Culture,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The strain diversity of a rubulavirus, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), was investigated by comparing 11 newly determined and 6 previously published genome sequences. These sequences represent 15 PIV5 strains, of which 6 were isolated from humans, 1 was from monkeys, 2 were from pigs, and 6 were from dogs. Strain diversity is remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographical origin; a total of 7.8% of nucleotides are variable, and the average pairwise difference between strains is 2.1%. Variation is distributed unevenly across the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of selection for antibody-mediated evasion in hemagglutinin-neuraminidase was found. The finding that some canine and porcine, but not primate, strains are mutated in the SH gene, and do not produce SH, raised the possibility that dogs (or pigs) may not be the natural host of PIV5. The genetic stability of PIV5 was also demonstrated during serial passage of one strain (W3) in Vero cells at a high multiplicity of infection, under conditions of competition with large proportions of defective interfering genomes. A similar observation was made for a strain W3 mutant (PIV5VΔC) lacking V gene function, in which the dominant changes were related to pseudoreversion in this gene. The mutations detected in PIV5VΔC during pseudoreversion, and also those characterizing the SH gene in canine and porcine strains, predominantly involved U-to-C transitions. This suggests an important role for biased hypermutation via an adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific (ADAR)-like activity.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Here we report the sequence variation of 16 different isolates of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) that were isolated from a number of species, including humans, monkeys, dogs, and pigs, over 4 decades. Surprisingly, strain diversity was remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographical origin. Variation was distributed unevenly across the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of immune or host selection was found. This overall genome stability of PIV5 was also observed when the virus was grown in the laboratory, and the genome stayed remarkably constant even during the selection of virus mutants. Some of the canine isolates had lost their ability to encode one of the viral proteins, termed SH, suggesting that although PIV5 commonly infects dogs, dogs may not be the natural host for PIV5.

New Minto virus: a new rhabdovirus from ticks in Alaska,"<jats:p> Three strains of a virus were isolated from Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris (Packard) ticks removed from snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) in east central Alaska. We suggest that the virus be named New Minto for the location in which the ticks were collected. Prototype New Minto virus is sensitive to the action of sodium deoxycholate and kills suckling mice by the intracerebral but not intraperitoneal route; weaned mice do not die after intracerebral, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous inoculation. The virus produces plaque in serially propagated Vero but not in primary Pekin duck embryo cells.By complement-fixation and neutralization tests New Minto is related to Sawgrass virus, a hitherto ungrouped virus from Florida. The establishment of a Sawgrass group is suggested. In addition, Sawgrass virus was found by electron microscopy to belong to the Family Rhabdoviridae. </jats:p>",0

Detection of Cattle Infected with Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Using Nucleic Acid Hybridization,"<jats:p> A ribonucleic acid (RNA) hybridization assay to identify cattle infected by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is described. The RNA probe was derived from the coding region at the 3′ end of the genome of the NADL strain of BVDV. Total RNA from infected cell cultures or peripheral blood leukocytes from suspect animals was extracted and applied to nylon membranes with a slot blot apparatus. Peripheral blood leukocytes were tested concurrently for BVDV by virus isolation. The results of hybridization and virus isolation were in agreement for 92% of the cases. When compared with virus isolation, hybridization had a sensitivity of detection of 59.5% and a specificity of 95%. Cross-reactivity to RNA extracts of border disease virus-infected cells was noted. No cross-reactivity was detected to other common bovine viruses (bovine herpesvirus-l, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, and bluetongue virus), to viruses classified in related families (equine arteritis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), or to viruses having similar genomic organization (dengue virus type 2 and Japanese encephalitis virus). </jats:p>",0

Bovine leukemia virus can be classified into seven genotypes: evidence for the existence of two novel clades,"<jats:p>Previous studies have classified the <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> sequences of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) provirus from different locations worldwide into between two and four genetic groupings. These different studies gave unique names to the identified groups and no study has yet integrated all the available sequences. Thus, we hypothesized that many of the different groups previously identified actually correspond to a limited group of genotypes that are unevenly distributed worldwide. To examine this hypothesis, we sequenced the <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> gene from 28 BLV field strains and compared these sequences to 46 <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> sequences that represent all the genetic groupings already identified. By using phylogenetic analyses, we recovered six clades, or genotypes, that we have called genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Genotypes 1–5 have counterparts among the sequence groupings identified previously. One <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> sequence did not cluster with any of the others and was highly divergent when compared with the six genotypes identified here. Thus, an extra genotype, which we named 7, may exist. Similarity comparisons were highly congruent with phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, our analyses confirmed the existence of geographical clusters.</jats:p>",0
Ultrastructural Findings in Lymph Nodes from Pigs Suffering from Naturally Occurring Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome,"<jats:p> The aims of this study were to evaluate ultrastructural lesions in lymph nodes from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS)-affected pigs and to correlate these alterations with detection of viral-like particles (VLPs). Samples of lymph nodes were taken from 4 PMWS-affected pigs and 2 healthy animals and processed by transmission electron microscopy. Significant ultrastructural alterations were only noted in PMWS-affected pigs, mainly in histiocytes and rarely in other cell types. Histiocytes showed severe swelling and proliferation of mitochondria, and proliferation and dilation of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Infected histiocytes contained large numbers of intracytoplasmic inclusion (ICI) bodies with VLPs; some histiocytes also had intranuclear inclusions (INIs). Small inclusions were surrounded by double membrane, with a granular appearance or containing paracrystalline arrays; icosahedral VLPs were 8–17 nm in diameter. Large ICIs were double-membrane bounded or not and contained VLPs usually forming paracrystalline arrays. ICIs were often found next to mitochondria with severe swelling, and also inside them. INIs were not surrounded by membranes and contained virions of 10–13 nm diameter. Lymphocyte depletion was a striking finding of lymph nodes from PMWS-affected pigs. The inclusion bodies containing VLPs referred to in the present study should be classified as viral factories, suggesting that viral replication is probably a frequent event in macrophages, in which mitochondria might play a role. </jats:p>",0

454-Pyrosequencing: A Molecular Battiscope for Freshwater Viral Ecology,"<jats:p>Viruses, the most abundant biological entities on the planet, are capable of infecting organisms from all three branches of life, although the majority infect bacteria where the greatest degree of cellular diversity lies. However, the characterization and assessment of viral diversity in natural environments is only beginning to become a possibility. Through the development of a novel technique for the harvest of viral DNA and the application of 454 pyrosequencing, a snapshot of the diversity of the DNA viruses harvested from a standing pond on a cattle farm has been obtained. A high abundance of viral genotypes (785) were present within the virome. The absolute numbers of lambdoid and Shiga toxin (Stx) encoding phages detected suggested that the depth of sequencing had enabled recovery of only ca. 8% of the total virus population, numbers that agreed within less than an order of magnitude with predictions made by rarefaction analysis. The most abundant viral genotypes in the pond were bacteriophages (93.7%). The predominant viral genotypes infecting higher life forms found in association with the farm were pathogens that cause disease in cattle and humans, e.g. members of the Herpesviridae. The techniques and analysis described here provide a fresh approach to the monitoring of viral populations in the aquatic environment, with the potential to become integral to the development of risk analysis tools for monitoring the dissemination of viral agents of animal, plant and human diseases.</jats:p>",0
"Studies of Genetic Relationships between Bovine, Caprine, Cervine, and Rangiferine Alphaherpesviruses and Improved Molecular Methods for Virus Detection and Identification","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The glycoprotein B (gB) and D (gD) genes from five ruminant alphaherpesviruses, bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine herpesvirus 5 (BHV-5), caprine herpesvirus 1 (CapHV-1), cervine herpesvirus 1, and rangiferine herpesvirus 1, were partially sequenced. The nucleotide sequence alignments revealed a highly conserved gB gene, with homologies ranging between 87.2 and 99.6%, and a more variable gD gene, with homologies ranging between 71.3 and 98.9%. The phylogenetic analysis of the gB and gD nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences revealed that BHV-5 is the most closely related virus to the BHV-1 subtype 1 and BHV-1 subtype 2 cluster and that CapHV-1 is the most distantly related virus. The phylogenetic data showed a close relationship of all the studied viruses with suid herpesvirus 1. On the basis of sequence data for the gB gene, a nested PCR combined with restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of the PCR products was developed for the simultaneous detection and identification of the viruses that were studied. Nested primers from highly conserved sequence stretches were selected in order to amplify a region of 294 bp in all five viruses, and a subsequent REA of the PCR products allowed specific identification. A mimic molecule that served as an internal standard of the amplification efficiency was constructed. The practical diagnostic applicability of the assay was evaluated with clinical samples consisting of semen and organ specimens from experimentally infected animals.</jats:p>",0

Diverse circovirus-like genome architectures revealed by environmental metagenomics,"<jats:p>Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses with circular genomes are the smallest viruses known to infect eukaryotes. The present study identified 10 novel genomes similar to ssDNA circoviruses through data-mining of public viral metagenomes. The metagenomic libraries included samples from reclaimed water and three different marine environments (Chesapeake Bay, British Columbia coastal waters and Sargasso Sea). All the genomes have similarities to the replication (Rep) protein of circoviruses; however, only half have genomic features consistent with known circoviruses. Some of the genomes exhibit a mixture of genomic features associated with different families of ssDNA viruses (i.e. circoviruses, geminiviruses and parvoviruses). Unique genome architectures and phylogenetic analysis of the Rep protein suggest that these viruses belong to novel genera and/or families. Investigating the complex community of ssDNA viruses in the environment can lead to the discovery of divergent species and help elucidate evolutionary links between ssDNA viruses.</jats:p>",0
Virus discovery in all three major lineages of terrestrial arthropods highlights the diversity of single-stranded DNA viruses associated with invertebrates,"<jats:p>Viruses encoding a replication-associated protein (Rep) within a covalently closed, single-stranded (ss)DNA genome are among the smallest viruses known to infect eukaryotic organisms, including economically valuable agricultural crops and livestock. Although circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS DNA) viruses are a widespread group for which our knowledge is rapidly expanding, biased sampling toward vertebrates and land plants has limited our understanding of their diversity and evolution. Here, we screened terrestrial arthropods for CRESS DNA viruses and report the identification of 44 viral genomes and replicons associated with specimens representing all three major terrestrial arthropod lineages, namely Euchelicerata (spiders), Hexapoda (insects), and Myriapoda (millipedes). We identified virus genomes belonging to three established CRESS DNA viral families (<jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Genomoviridae</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Smacoviridae</jats:italic>); however, over half of the arthropod-associated viral genomes are only distantly related to currently classified CRESS DNA viral sequences. Although members of viral and satellite families known to infect plants (<jats:italic>Geminiviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Nanoviridae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Alphasatellitidae</jats:italic>) were not identified in this study, these plant-infecting CRESS DNA viruses and replicons are transmitted by hemipterans. Therefore, members from six out of the seven established CRESS DNA viral families circulate among arthropods. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of Reps, including endogenous viral sequences, reported to date from a wide array of organisms revealed that most of the known CRESS DNA viral diversity circulates among invertebrates. Our results highlight the vast and unexplored diversity of CRESS DNA viruses among invertebrates and parallel findings from RNA viral discovery efforts in undersampled taxa.</jats:p>",0
Challenges of the Unknown: Clinical Application of Microbial Metagenomics,"<jats:p>Availability of fast, high throughput and low cost whole genome sequencing holds great promise within public health microbiology, with applications ranging from outbreak detection and tracking transmission events to understanding the role played by microbial communities in health and disease. Within clinical metagenomics, identifying microorganisms from a complex and host enriched background remains a central computational challenge. As proof of principle, we sequenced two metagenomic samples, a known viral mixture of 25 human pathogens and an unknown complex biological model using benchtop technology. The datasets were then analysed using a bioinformatic pipeline developed around recent fast classification methods. A targeted approach was able to detect 20 of the viruses against a background of host contamination from multiple sources and bacterial contamination. An alternative untargeted identification method was highly correlated with these classifications, and over 1,600 species were identified when applied to the complex biological model, including several species captured at over 50% genome coverage. In summary, this study demonstrates the great potential of applying metagenomics within the clinical laboratory setting and that this can be achieved using infrastructure available to nondedicated sequencing centres.</jats:p>",0

Deep sequencing reveals abundant noncanonical retroviral microRNAs in B-cell leukemia/lymphoma,"<jats:p>Viral tumor models have significantly contributed to our understanding of oncogenic mechanisms. How transforming delta-retroviruses induce malignancy, however, remains poorly understood, especially as viral mRNA/protein are tightly silenced in tumors. Here, using deep sequencing of broad windows of small RNA sizes in the bovine leukemia virus ovine model of leukemia/lymphoma, we provide in vivo evidence of the production of noncanonical RNA polymerase III (Pol III)-transcribed viral microRNAs in leukemic B cells in the complete absence of Pol II 5′-LTR–driven transcriptional activity. Processed from a cluster of five independent self-sufficient transcriptional units located in a proviral region dispensable for in vivo infectivity, bovine leukemia virus microRNAs represent ∼40% of all microRNAs in both experimental and natural malignancy. They are subject to strong purifying selection and associate with Argonautes, consistent with a critical function in silencing of important cellular and/or viral targets. Bovine leukemia virus microRNAs are strongly expressed in preleukemic and malignant cells in which structural and regulatory gene expression is repressed, suggesting a key role in tumor onset and progression. Understanding how Pol III-dependent microRNAs subvert cellular and viral pathways will contribute to deciphering the intricate perturbations that underlie malignant transformation.</jats:p>",0

Identification and complete genome sequencing of paramyxoviruses in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) using random access amplification and next generation sequencing technologies,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>During a wildlife screening program for avian influenza A viruses (AIV) and avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) in Belgium, we isolated two hemagglutinating agents from pools of cloacal swabs of wild mallards (<jats:italic>Anas platyrhynchos</jats:italic>) caught in a single sampling site at two different times. AIV and APMV1 were excluded using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing and specific real-time RT-PCR tests.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            <jats:p>To refine the virological identification of APMV2-10 realized by HI subtyping tests and in lack of validated molecular tests for APMV2-10, random access amplification was used in combination with next generation sequencing for the sequence independent identification of the viruses and the determination of their genomes.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Three different APMVs were identified. From one pooled sample, the complete genome sequence (15054 nucleotides) of an APMV4 was assembled from the random sequences. From the second pooled sample, the nearly complete genome sequence of an APMV6 (genome size of 16236 nucleotides) was determined, as well as a partial sequence for an APMV4. This APMV4 was closely related but not identical to the APMV4 isolated from the first sample. Although a cross-reactivity with other APMV subtypes did not allow formal identification, the HI subtyping revealed APMV4 and APMV6 in the respective pooled samples but failed to identify the co-infecting APMV4 in the APMV6 infected pool.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>These data further contribute to the knowledge about the genetic diversity within the serotypes APMV4 and 6, and confirm the limited sensitivity of the HI subtyping test. Moreover, this study demonstrates the value of a random access nucleic acid amplification method in combination with massive parallel sequencing. Using only a moderate and economical sequencing effort, the characterization and full genome sequencing of APMVs can be obtained, including the identification of viruses in mixed infections.</jats:p>

Markers for Ongoing or Previous Hepatitis E Virus Infection Are as Common in Wild Ungulates as in Humans in Sweden,"<jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a human pathogen with zoonotic spread, infecting both domestic and wild animals. About 17% of the Swedish population is immune to HEV, but few cases are reported annually, indicating that most infections are subclinical. However, clinical hepatitis E may also be overlooked. For identified cases, the source of infection is mostly unknown. In order to identify whether HEV may be spread from wild game, the prevalence of markers for past and/or ongoing infection was investigated in sera and stool samples collected from 260 hunted Swedish wild ungulates. HEV markers were found in 43 (17%) of the animals. The most commonly infected animal was moose (Alces alces) with 19 out of 69 animals (28%) showing HEV markers, followed by wild boar (Sus scrofa) with 21 out of 139 animals (15%), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) with 2 out of 30 animals, red deer (Cervus elaphus) with 1 out of 15 animals, and fallow deer (Dama dama) 0 out of 7 animals. Partial open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of the viral genomes from the animals were sequenced and compared with those from 14 endemic human cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that three humans were infected with HEV strains similar to those from wild boar. These results indicate that wild animals may be a source of transmission to humans and could be an unrecognized public health concern.</jats:p>",0

"Investigation of foot-and mouth disease outbreak in a pig farm at Kollam district of Kerala, India","<jats:p>The present paper describes the investigation of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in a private pig farm at Kotty in Kollam district of Kerala during October 2013. During the clinical phase, severe vesicular lesions on snout and skin around the coronary bands were observed in pigs. A total of 48 serum samples and 12 clinical samples (ruptured snout epithelia) were collected. All serum samples were subjected to indirect 3AB nonstructural protein (NSP) ELISA and liquid phase blocking (LPB) ELISA. In 3AB NSP ELISA, all serum samples were found positive for NSP antibodies indicating infection. In LPB ELISA, 42 of 48 (87.5%) pigs were found to have protective log10 antibody titre of ³1.8 against FMD virus serotypes O, A and Asia 1. All the clinical materials were found positive for serotype O in antigen detection ELISA as well as in multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR). In VP1 region-based phylogenetic analysis, the serotype O isolates causing the outbreak were found to conglomerate within Ind2001 lineage. Pigs infected with FMD may pose rigorous threat to other susceptible domestic livestock as they exhale enormous quantity of virus. As a consequence, they should be included under prophylactic vaccination and surveillance programmes ongoing in the country.</jats:p>",0

Although the majority of confirmed rabies cases in wild carnivore species are reported from the yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata), the rest are from other wild carnivores including the highly endangered wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Lyssavirus infection was confirmed in two wild dogs and a spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) in the Madikwe Game Reserve, North West province in South Africa, in 2014 and 2015, using a direct fluorescent antibody test and immunohistochemistry. There had been no new wild dog introductions to the Madikwe Game Reserve for many years and the wild dogs were last vaccinated against rabies approximately 11 years prior to the incident. The first euthanised wild dog was the last surviving of a break-away pack of 6, and the second was the last of a larger pack of 18, the rest of which died with no carcasses being found or carcasses too decomposed for sampling. Subsequent antigenic typing of the lyssaviruses indicated that they were canid RABVs. The RABVs originating from 22 wild carnivore species, 7 dogs, and a caprine, mostly from the North West province, were genetically characterised by targeting a partial region of the nucleoprotein gene. The nucleotide sequence analyses of these viruses and two previously characterised RABVs confirmed that the outbreak viruses were also canid rabies, phylogenetically clustering with virus isolates originating from black-backed jackals recovered between 2012 and 2015 from the North West province, and domestic dogs from neighbouring communal areas. The source(s) of the mortalities and possible reservoir host(s) for the virus could only be speculated upon from data on specific predator numbers, movements and behaviour, kills, park management and the changing environmental ecology, which were monitored closely in Madikwe over several years. The most likely rabies sources were from boundary fence contacts between wild carnivores within the park, with domestic dogs or cats and/or naturally occurring wild carnivores outside the park. The associated risk of zoonotic infection and threat to important and endangered predators may be mitigated through regional rabies control primarily in domestic dogs and cats, as well as by preventative vaccination of at-risk park employees and their pets. The importance of ongoing prophylactic rabies protection by regular vaccination of highly endangered wildlife carnivores and the submission of carcasses for rabies diagnosis of any wild or domestic animals behaving uncharacteristically or found dead is emphasised.</jats:p>",0

Biological and molecular diagnosis of seedborne viruses in cowpea germplasm of geographically diverse sub‐Saharan origins,"<jats:p>A total of 983 cowpea accessions obtained from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) Cowpea Repository were analysed for seedborne viruses. A majority of the accessions originated from 11 countries representing different agroclimatic zones in sub‐Saharan Africa, and included landraces, local cultivars and breeding lines. Following the initial grow‐out tests, 69 cowpea accessions, mostly with symptoms of virus infection, were selected for further evaluation using a combination of host range, reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) and sequence analyses. The analyses revealed that samples from 46 (67%) accessions harboured one or more known seedborne viruses of cowpea. These included seed samples of accessions originating from Botswana (13 accessions), Ghana (6), Nigeria (6), Mali (1), Kenya (5), Cameroon (7), Niger (4), Côte d’lvoire (1), Benin (1), India (1) and China (1). Viruses were identified by RT‐PCR analysis of total RNAs extracted from suspected virus‐infected samples using virus species‐specific primers, as well as the cloning and sequencing of RT‐PCR products amplified using virus genus‐ and family‐specific degenerate oligonucleotide primers.

A Four-Biomarker Blood Signature Discriminates Systemic Inflammation Due to Viral Infection Versus Other Etiologies,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The innate immune system of humans and other mammals responds to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are conserved across broad classes of infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses. We hypothesized that a blood-based transcriptional signature could be discovered indicating a host systemic response to viral infection. Previous work identified host transcriptional signatures to individual viruses including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and dengue, but the generality of these signatures across all viral infection types has not been established. Based on 44 publicly available datasets and two clinical studies of our own design, we discovered and validated a four-gene expression signature in whole blood, indicative of a general host systemic response to many types of viral infection. The signature’s genes are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (<jats:italic>ISG15</jats:italic>), Interleukin 16 (<jats:italic>IL16</jats:italic>), 2′,5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (<jats:italic>OASL</jats:italic>), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (<jats:italic>ADGRE5</jats:italic>). In each of 13 validation datasets encompassing human, macaque, chimpanzee, pig, mouse, rat and all seven Baltimore virus classification groups, the signature provides statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) discrimination between viral and non-viral conditions. The signature may have clinical utility for differentiating host systemic inflammation (SI) due to viral versus bacterial or non-infectious causes.</jats:p>",0

Single major polypeptide of a calicivirus: characterization by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stabilization of virions by cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate,"<jats:p>A calicivirus, San Miguel sea lion virus serotype 4, isolate 15FT, externally labelled with 125I, was shown by gel electrophoresis to possess a single major polypeptide. The polypeptide migrated anomalously upon electrophoresis in two sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) systems: more slowly than bovine serum albumin in a continuous phosphate-buffered system and more rapidly than bovine serum albumin in a discontinuous system. Estimated molecular weights in the two systems were approximately 71,000 and 64,000, respectively. There was no clear evidence for a minor virion polypeptide. Treatment of purified San Miguel sea lion virions with dimethyl suberimidate, a cross-linking reagent, preserved virion integrity during long-term storage at 4 degrees C. Oligomeric species of the polypeptide were observed upon electrophoresis of products from cross-linked virions. Based upon a preferred polypeptide molecular weight estimate of 71,000 and distribution of oligomeric species, a calicivirion model with 120 monomeric protein units is proposed as an alternative to a 180-unit model.</jats:p>",0

Comparisons of Venezuelan encephalitis virus strains by hemagglutination-inhibition tests with chicken antibodies,"<jats:p>Twenty strains of Venezuelan encephalitis (VE) virus inoculated intravenously in large doses into roosters produced hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies detectable in plasmas within 7 to 10 days. No signs of illness occurred, and there was no evidence of viral growth in tissues since blood concentrations of infectious virus steadily decreased after inoculation. HI antibodies in early plasmas were specific for VE virus and did not cross-react significantly with two other North American alphaviruses, eastern and western encephalitis viruses. VE virus strains could be distinquished by virus-dilution, short-incubation HI, but not by plasma-dilution neutralization tests, by using early rooster antibodies. The distinctions by HI test were similar with some strains to, but different with other strains from, those described by Young and Johnson with the spiny rat antisera used to establish their subtype classifications of VE virus (14, 28). Nevertheless, results of HI tests with rooster antibodies correlated with equine virulence, as did results with spiny rat antibodies, and distinguished the new strains of virus that appeared in Middle America during the VE outbreak of 1969 from preexisting strains.</jats:p>",0
"Prevalence of Porcine Noroviruses, Molecular Characterization of Emerging Porcine Sapoviruses from Finisher Swine in the United States, and Unified Classification Scheme for Sapoviruses","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Noroviruses (NoVs) and sapoviruses (SaVs) are important human pathogens. Although the involvement of porcine NoVs in disease in pigs is unclear, they are genetically and antigenically closely related to human NoVs. Human NoV-like strains have been detected in pigs, raising public health concerns of potential interspecies transmission. Porcine SaVs are highly diverse and emerging in swine populations. Recently, at least three new genogroups of porcine SaVs have been proposed. In this study, we tested 413 pooled fecal samples collected from apparently healthy finisher pigs in North Carolina swine farms during 2009. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR coupled hybridization assays were performed to detect known porcine NoVs. The overall prevalence of porcine NoVs determined was 18.9% based on this method. Samples were then tested by RT-PCR targeting the 5′ end of the capsid region for genogroup II (GII) NoVs, a group which includes human NoVs, followed by sequence analysis. All NoVs identified belonged to typical porcine NoV genotypes, and no human NoV-like strains were detected in specimens from these pigs. Porcine NoV-negative samples (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 335) were subsequently screened using universal calicivirus primers, and 17 SaV strains were confirmed by sequencing. Based on the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, they clustered with GIII, GVII, and GVIII and with currently unclassified SaVs. According to analysis of the complete capsid sequences, 7 representative strains clustered with GVII, GVIII, and GIX? SaVs. We tentatively classified SaVs into 14 genogroups based on the complete capsid protein VP1. In summary, porcine NoVs and highly divergent SaVs were present in North Carolina finisher pigs.

            are widely spread among vertebrate host species and normally cause acute but innocuous infections. Special attention is focused on adenoviruses because of their ability to transform host cells, their possible application in vector technology, and their phylogeny. The primary structure of the genome of Tupaia adenovirus (TAV), which infects
            <jats:italic>Tupaia</jats:italic>
            spp. (tree shrew) was determined. Tree shrews are taxonomically assumed to be at the base of the phylogenetic tree of mammals and are frequently used as laboratory animals in neurological and behavior research. The TAV genome is 33,501 bp in length with a G+C content of 49.96% and has 166-bp inverted terminal repeats. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence resulted in the identification of 109 open reading frames (ORFs) with a coding capacity of at least 40 amino acid residues. Thirty-eight of them are predicted to encode viral proteins based on the presence of transcription and translation signals and sequence and positional conservation. Thirty viral ORFs were found to show significant similarities to known adenoviral genes, arranged into discrete early and late genome regions as they are known from mastadenoviruses. Analysis of the nucleotide content of the TAV genome revealed a significant CG dinucleotide depletion at the genome ends that suggests methylation of these genomic regions during the viral life cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral gene products, including penton and hexon proteins, viral protease, terminal protein, protein VIII, DNA polymerase, protein IVa2, and 100,000-molecular-weight protein, revealed that the evolutionary lineage of TAV forms a separate branch within the phylogenetic tree of the

Comparative analysis reveals frequent recombination in the parvoviruses,"<jats:p>Parvoviruses are small single-stranded DNA viruses that are ubiquitous in nature. Infections with both autonomous and helper-virus dependent parvoviruses are common in both human and animal populations, and many animals are host to a number of different parvoviral species. Despite the epidemiological importance of parvoviruses, the presence and role of genome recombination within or among parvoviral species has not been well characterized. Here we show that natural recombination may be widespread in these viruses. Different genome regions of both porcine parvoviruses and Aleutian mink disease viruses have conflicting phylogenetic histories, providing evidence for recombination within each of these two species. Further, the rodent parvoviruses show complex evolutionary histories for separate genomic regions, suggesting recombination at the interspecies level.</jats:p>",0

The Fecal Virome of Pigs on a High-Density Farm,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Swine are an important source of proteins worldwide but are subject to frequent viral outbreaks and numerous infections capable of infecting humans. Modern farming conditions may also increase viral transmission and potential zoonotic spread. We describe here the metagenomics-derived virome in the feces of 24 healthy and 12 diarrheic piglets on a high-density farm. An average of 4.2 different mammalian viruses were shed by healthy piglets, reflecting a high level of asymptomatic infections. Diarrheic pigs shed an average of 5.4 different mammalian viruses.

Multiple small circular DNA genomes encoding replicase proteins plus two highly divergent members of the<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Picornavirales</jats:named-content>order were also characterized. The possible origin of these viral genomes from pig-infecting protozoans and nematodes, based on closest sequence similarities, is discussed.

A Naturally Occurring Recombinant Enterovirus Expresses a Torovirus Deubiquitinase,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Enteroviruses (EVs) are implicated in a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. In this study, a novel enterovirus (enterovirus species G [EVG]) (EVG 08/NC_USA/2015) was isolated from a diagnostic sample from a neonatal pig diarrhea case and identified by using metagenomics and complete genome sequencing. The viral genome shares 75.4% nucleotide identity with a prototypic EVG strain (PEV9 UKG/410/73). Remarkably, a 582-nucleotide insertion, flanked by 3C
            <jats:sup>pro</jats:sup>
            cleavage sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, was found in the 2C/3A junction region of the viral genome. This insertion encodes a predicted protease with 54 to 68% amino acid identity to torovirus (ToV) papain-like protease (PLP) (ToV-PLP). Structural homology modeling predicts that this protease adopts a fold and a catalytic site characteristic of minimal PLP catalytic domains. This structure is similar to those of core catalytic domains of the foot-and-mouth disease virus leader protease and coronavirus PLPs, which act as deubiquitinating and deISGylating (interferon [IFN]-stimulated gene 15 [ISG15]-removing) enzymes on host cell substrates. Importantly, the recombinant ToV-PLP protein derived from this novel enterovirus also showed strong deubiquitination and deISGylation activities and demonstrated the ability to suppress IFN-β expression. Using reverse genetics, we generated a ToV-PLP knockout recombinant virus. Compared to the wild-type virus, the ToV-PLP knockout mutant virus showed impaired growth and induced higher expression levels of innate immune genes in infected cells. These results suggest that ToV-PLP functions as an innate immune antagonist; enterovirus G may therefore gain fitness through the acquisition of ToV-PLP from a recombination event.

          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Enteroviruses comprise a highly diversified group of viruses. Genetic recombination has been considered a driving force for viral evolution; however, recombination between viruses from two different orders is a rare event. In this study, we identified a special case of cross-order recombination between enterovirus G (order
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Picornavirales</jats:named-content>
            ) and torovirus (order
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Nidovirales</jats:named-content>
            ). This naturally occurring recombination event may have broad implications for other picornaviral and/or nidoviral species. Importantly, we demonstrated that the exogenous ToV-PLP gene that was inserted into the EVG genome encodes a deubiquitinase/deISGylase and potentially suppresses host cellular innate immune responses. Our results provide insights into how a gain of function through genetic recombination, in particular cross-order recombination, may improve the ability of a virus to evade host immunity.

Comparative metagenomics of microbial traits within oceanic viral communities,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Viral genomes often contain genes recently acquired from microbes. In some cases (for example, psbA) the proteins encoded by these genes have been shown to be important for viral replication. In this study, using a unique search strategy on the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) metagenomes in combination with marine virome and microbiome pyrosequencing-based datasets, we characterize previously undetected microbial metabolic capabilities concealed within the genomes of uncultured marine viral communities. A total of 34 microbial gene families were detected on 452 viral GOS scaffolds. The majority of auxiliary metabolic genes found on these scaffolds have never been reported in phages. Host genes detected in viruses were mainly divided between genes encoding for different energy metabolism pathways, such as electron transport and newly identified photosystem genes, or translation and post-translation mechanism related. Our findings suggest previously undetected ways, in which marine phages adapt to their hosts and improve their fitness, including translation and post-translation level control over the host rather than the already known transcription level control.</jats:p>",0

            genes. The B30.2/SPRY domain of 505265 exhibits long variable regions, a characteristic of the proteins encoded by this paralogous group, and shows evidence of positive selection. Apparently, cows have independently evolved a retroviral restriction factor from the same TRIM family that spawned TRIM5 in primates. Particular features of this subset of cytoplasmic TRIM proteins may be conducive to the convergent evolution of virus-restricting factors.

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Phylogenetic analysis revealed close clustering and highest sequence identity in all 8 genes to HPAI H5N1 isolates belonging to unified H5 clade 2.2, sub-lineage EMA-3 recovered from Afghanistan during the same time period. Two subgroups within Pakistani H5N1 viruses, from domestic and wild birds, were observed on the basis of their sequence homology and mutations. HPAI motif, preferred receptor specificity for α-(2, 3) linkages, potential N-linked glycosylation sites and an additional glycosylation site at the globular head of HA protein of four Pakistani H5N1 isolates. While, the amino acids associated with sensitivities to various antiviral drugs (Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, Amantadine) were found conserved for the Pakistani H5N1 isolates. Conspicuously, some important mutations observed at critical positions of antigenic sites (S141P, D155S, R162I &amp; P181S) and at receptor binding pocket (A185T, R189K &amp; S217P) of HA-1. A high sequence similarity between Pakistani HP H5N1 and LP H9N2 viruses was also observed.

Characterization and classification of virus particles associated with hepatitis A. II. Type and configuration of nucleic acid,"<jats:p>Virus particles banding at 1.34 g/ml in CsCl and sedimenting at 160S in sucrose gradients were isolated from fecal specimens of patients suffering from hepatitis. In the presence of 4 M urea and about 90% formamide, these particles released linear nucleic acid molecules of the kinked appearance characteristic of single-stranded RNA or single-stranded DNA. They could be distinguished from the nucleic acid of phage lambda added to the preparation as a marker for double-stranded configuration. Experiments in which the virus particles under investigation were incubated at pH 12.9 at 50 degrees C for 30 min revealed that their nucleic acid molecules were hydrolyzed as readily as the RNA genome of poliovirus type 2 analyzed in parallel. Both the single-stranded DNA of phage phiX174 and that of parvovirus LuIII, however, proved unaffected by this treatment, and the double-stranded DNA of phage lambda was denatured to single-stranded molecules. It was concluded, therefore, that the virus of human hepatitis A contains a linear genome of single-stranded RNA and has to be classified with the picornaviruses.</jats:p>",0

"Complete Sequence Analyses of Enterovirus 71 Strains from Fatal and Non‐Fatal Cases of the Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease Outbreak in Singapore (2000)","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major aetiological agent of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). In recent years, several outbreaks in East Asia were associated with neurological complications and numerous deaths. An outbreak in Singapore in October 2000 afflicted thousands of children, resulting in four fatal cases from three of whom EV71 was isolated. The genomes of two representative EV71 strains isolated from a fatal case and a surviving patient were completely sequenced, and their nucleotide and amino acid sequences compared with known EV71 strains. The two outbreak strains were classified under genogroup B, together with those previously isolated in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan. Comparative sequence analysis of the two Singapore strains revealed 99% nucleotide similarity, while their deduced amino acid sequences were almost identical except for residue 1506 in the 3A non‐structural region. Given that the outbreak involved closely related genetic variants of EV71, the broad spectrum of disease severity may be attributed to critical factors such as varying viral inoculation doses or differing host immune responses following infection, but is less likely to be due to the emergence of EV71 strains with heightened virulence.</jats:p>",0

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Hepeviridae</jats:named-content>
            family that infect birds, bats, rodents, and fish. These conflicts arise because of differences in the viruses and genomic regions compared and in the methodology used. We have reexamined published sequences and found that synonymous substitutions were saturated in comparisons between and within virus genotypes. Analysis of complete genome sequences or concatenated ORF1/ORF2 amino acid sequences indicated that HEV variants most closely related to those infecting humans can be consistently divided into six genotypes (types 1 to 4 and two additional genotypes from wild boar). Variants isolated from rabbits, closely related to genotype 3, occupy an intermediate position. No consistent criteria could be defined for the assignment of virus subtypes. Analysis of amino acid sequences from these viruses with the more divergent variants from chickens, bats, and rodents in three conserved subgenomic regions (residues 1 to 452 or 974 to 1534 of ORF1 or residues 105 to 458 of ORF2) provided consistent support for a division into 4 groups, corresponding to HEV variants infecting humans and pigs, those infecting rats and ferrets, those from bats, and those from chickens. This approach may form the basis for a future genetic classification of HEV into four species, with the more divergent HEV-like virus from fish (cutthroat trout virus) representing a second genus.

Consensus proposals for classification of the family Hepeviridae,"<jats:p>The family <jats:italic>Hepeviridae</jats:italic> consists of positive-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian species, as well as chickens and trout. A subset of these viruses infects humans and can cause a self-limiting acute hepatitis that may become chronic in immunosuppressed individuals. Current published descriptions of the taxonomical divisions within the family <jats:italic>Hepeviridae</jats:italic> are contradictory in relation to the assignment of species and genotypes. Through analysis of existing sequence information, we propose a taxonomic scheme in which the family is divided into the genera <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> (all mammalian and avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates) and <jats:italic>Piscihepevirus</jats:italic> (cutthroat trout virus). Species within the genus <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> are designated <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> A (isolates from human, pig, wild boar, deer, mongoose, rabbit and camel), <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> B (isolates from chicken), <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> C (isolates from rat, greater bandicoot, Asian musk shrew, ferret and mink) and <jats:italic>Orthohepevirus</jats:italic> D (isolates from bat). Proposals are also made for the designation of genotypes within the human and rat HEVs. This hierarchical system is congruent with hepevirus phylogeny, and the three classification levels (genus, species and genotype) are consistent with, and reflect discontinuities in the ranges of pairwise distances between amino acid sequences. Adoption of this system would include the avoidance of host names in taxonomic identifiers and provide a logical framework for the assignment of novel variants.</jats:p>",0
Dating the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses,"<jats:p>Pandemic influenza viruses cause significant mortality in humans. In the 20th century, 3 influenza viruses caused major pandemics: the 1918 H1N1 virus, the 1957 H2N2 virus, and the 1968 H3N2 virus. These pandemics were initiated by the introduction and successful adaptation of a novel hemagglutinin subtype to humans from an animal source, resulting in antigenic shift. Despite global concern regarding a new pandemic influenza, the emergence pathway of pandemic strains remains unknown. Here we estimated the evolutionary history and inferred date of introduction to humans of each of the genes for all 20th century pandemic influenza strains. Our results indicate that genetic components of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus circulated in mammalian hosts, i.e., swine and humans, as early as 1911 and was not likely to be a recently introduced avian virus. Phylogenetic relationships suggest that the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus (BM/1918) was generated by reassortment between mammalian viruses and a previously circulating human strain, either in swine or, possibly, in humans. Furthermore, seasonal and classic swine H1N1 viruses were not derived directly from BM/1918, but their precursors co-circulated during the pandemic. Mean estimates of the time of most recent common ancestor also suggest that the H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic strains may have been generated through reassortment events in unknown mammalian hosts and involved multiple avian viruses preceding pandemic recognition. The possible generation of pandemic strains through a series of reassortment events in mammals over a period of years before pandemic recognition suggests that appropriate surveillance strategies for detection of precursor viruses may abort future pandemics.</jats:p>",0

Re-Assembly and Analysis of an Ancient Variola Virus Genome,"<jats:p>We report a major improvement to the assembly of published short read sequencing data from an ancient variola virus (VARV) genome by the removal of contig-capping sequencing tags and manual searches for gap-spanning reads. The new assembly, together with camelpox and taterapox genomes, permitted new dates to be calculated for the last common ancestor of all VARV genomes. The analysis of recently sequenced VARV-like cowpox virus genomes showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amino acid changes in the vaccinia virus (VACV)-Cop-O1L ortholog, predicted to be associated with VARV host specificity and virulence, were introduced into the lineage before the divergence of these viruses. A comparison of the ancient and modern VARV genome sequences also revealed a measurable drift towards adenine + thymine (A + T) richness.</jats:p>",0
"Novel Gyroviruses, including Chicken Anaemia Virus, in Clinical and Chicken Samples from South Africa","<jats:p><jats:italic>Introduction</jats:italic>. Chicken anaemia virus, CAV, was until recently the only member of the<jats:italic>Gyrovirus</jats:italic>genus. 6 novel gyroviruses, AGV2, HGyV1, and GyV3-6, have since been discovered in human and chicken samples.<jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. PCR amplification of the VP2 gene was used to detect AGV2/HGyV1, GyV3, and CAV in a range of clinical samples including stool, respiratory, CSF, and HIV-positive plasma. Screening of fresh local chicken meat was also performed.<jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. AGV2/HGyV1 or GyV3 was detected in stools from healthy children (17/49, 34.7%) and patients with diarrhoea (22/149, 14.8%). 1.2% (3/246) nasopharyngeal respiratory samples were positive. No AGV2/HGyV1 or GyV3 was detected in nasal swabs from wheezing patients, in CSF from patients with meningitis, and in HIVpositive plasma. CAV was found in 51% (25/49) of stools from healthy children and 16% (24/149) in diarrhoea samples. Screening of 28 chicken samples showed a higher prevalence of gyrovirus (20/28, 71%) compared to CAV (1/28, 3.6%). Phylogenetic analysis of the CAV VP1 gene showed South African sequences clustering with Brazilian isolates from genotypes D2 and A2.<jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>. Novel gyroviruses, including CAV, are present in the South African population with diarrhoea and respiratory illness as well as in healthy children. Their presence suggests an origin from chicken meat consumption.</jats:p>",0
A Review of the Strain Diversity and Pathogenesis of Chicken Astrovirus,"<jats:p>Although a relatively recently emerged virus, identified only in 2004 as a separate species of avian astrovirus, chicken astrovirus (CAstV) has been associated with poor growth of broiler flocks, enteritis and diarrhea and is a candidate pathogen in cases of runting stunting syndrome. More recently CAstV has been implicated in cases of two other diseases of broilers as the sole etiological agent, namely severe kidney disease of young broilers with visceral gout and the “White Chicks” hatchery disease. Examination of the strains of CAstV associated with the two latter diseases reveals they are closely related genetically. This review will discuss the pathogenesis of CAstV in relation to strain diversity and the effects of vertical versus horizontal transmission, virus load, co-infections and age of bird at infection, all factors that may impact upon disease severity.</jats:p>",0

High-Throughput Sequencing of Putative Novel microRNAs in Rhesus Monkey Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells following EV71 and CA16 Infection,"<jats:p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) remain the major pathogens in hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) cases, but the mechanisms of the different pathogeneses that follow EV71 and CA16 infection remain largely unknown. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Herein, we utilized microRNA (miRNA) deep sequencing to investigate the roles of novel differentially expressed miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with EV71 and CA16. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The results identified 13 novel differentially expressed miRNAs in each group. Additionally, the target genes were predicted by the miRanda and RNAhybrid programs, and a total of 2,501 targets were found in the two databases. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that these targets were mainly involved in cell development and were associated with nervous system development, system development, multicellular organism development, the Wnt signaling pathway, the PDGF signaling pathway, and the EGF receptor signaling pathway. Finally, a coexpression regulatory network was built with the key targets to further extrapolate the functional interactions of the targets and their coexpressed genes. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Our results not only revealed potential biomarkers or targets for the diagnosis and treatment of HFMD, but also provided new insights to explore the mechanisms of EV71 and CA16 pathogenesis.</jats:p>",0
Evidence of Human-to-Swine Transmission of the Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza Virus in South Korea,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>As the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus continues to infect human populations globally, reports on epidemiologically linked animal infections are also on the rise. Since December 2009, pandemic (H1N1) 2009-like viruses have been isolated in pigs from different swine farms of South Korea. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of viral segments demonstrated several events of human-to-swine transmission with no apparent signs of reassortment. These events were also supported by serological surveillance in pig sera collected from April to December, suggesting that reverse transmission probably started between June and July with a drastic increase in prevalence the following months. Although molecular characterization indicates that the swine isolates are generally stable, some viruses are genetically evolving, most notably in their surface proteins. Animal studies (ferrets and mice) reveal that swine pandemic isolates epitomize biological properties attributed to the currently circulating human pandemic viruses, including replication kinetics and efficient transmission, indicating their potential to return to circulation among humans. Overall, these results indicate widespread human-to-animal transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses in South Korea. With the significant role of pigs in the ecology of influenza viruses, these transmission events should be closely monitored and minimized to prevent the risk of generating viruses with greater human health concerns.</jats:p>",0

Pathological and molecular findings of avian avulavirus type 1 outbreak in pigeons (Columba livia) of southern Brazil,"<jats:p>ABSTRACT: The Newcastle disease, caused by avian avulavirus type 1 strains (APMV-1) is an important avian disease involved into high rates of mortality and economic losses. Several outbreaks have been reported over the last 30 years in Columbiformes in different parts of the world, caused by a adapted variant strain of AAvV-1, called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1). A high mortality associated with an outbreak was analyzed in free-living pigeons (Columba livia) in a public square in Porto Alegre in Southern Brazil. A total of 24 pigeons moribund or freshly dead, within five weeks interval were submitted to necropsy, histopathological, immunohistochemical (anti-Newcastle), and RT-PCR followed by sequencing of the amplification products analysis. They presented neurological signs, non-suppurative encephalitis and encephalomyelitis, and mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in different organs. Immunohistochemical analysis in nine pigeons tissue showed that anti-Newcastle was expressed in brain, kidney, liver and pancreas. The RT-PCR test for the M protein of Newcastle disease virus was positive in six pigeons. The differential diagnosis of Influenza, West Nile, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae in all pigeons presented negative results. The sequence of amino acids in the cleavage site region of the F protein was 112RRQKRF117 classifying the strain as virulent. The phylogenetic analysis classified this virus strain into Class II and VI genotype.</jats:p>",0
Viral diversity of Rhipicephalus microplus parasitizing cattle in southern Brazil,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ticks are ectoparasites spread worldwide and are well known as vectors of many viruses of great importance to human and animal health.

Our study sheds light on the viral diversity of <jats:italic>Rhipicephalus microplus</jats:italic> in South America, and also expands the biogeography of tick viruses that were previously described only in Asia.</jats:p>",0
Characterization of Low-Pathogenicity H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses from North America,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Wild-bird surveillance in North America for avian influenza (AI) viruses with a goal of early identification of the Asian H5N1 highly pathogenic AI virus has identified at least six low-pathogenicity H5N1 AI viruses between 2004 and 2006. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from all 6 H5N1 viruses and an additional 38 North American wild-bird-origin H5 subtype and 28 N1 subtype viruses were sequenced and compared with sequences available in GenBank by phylogenetic analysis. Both HA and NA were phylogenetically distinct from those for viruses from outside of North America and from those for viruses recovered from mammals. Four of the H5N1 AI viruses were characterized as low pathogenicity by standard in vivo pathotyping tests. One of the H5N1 viruses, A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06, was shown to replicate to low titers in chickens, turkeys, and ducks. However, transmission of A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 was more efficient among ducks than among chickens or turkeys based on virus shed. The 50% chicken infectious dose for A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 and three other wild-waterfowl-origin H5 viruses were also determined and were between 10
            <jats:sup>5.3</jats:sup>
            and 10
            <jats:sup>7.5</jats:sup>
            50% egg infective doses. Finally, seven H5 viruses representing different phylogenetic clades were evaluated for their antigenic relatedness by hemagglutination inhibition assay, showing that the antigenic relatedness was largely associated with geographic origin. Overall, the data support the conclusion that North American H5 wild-bird-origin AI viruses are low-pathogenicity wild-bird-adapted viruses and are antigenically and genetically distinct from the highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 virus lineage.

Physical and chemical characterization of an avian reovirus,"<jats:p>The avian viral agent S1133 has previously been classified serologically as a member of the avian reovirus group. This viral agent grows in chicken embryo fibroblast cells, bands at a density of 1.37 g/ml in CsCl equilibrium density gradients, has a particle diameter of 75 nm, and has a morphology similar to that of human reovirus type 3. Its nucleic acid is comprised of double-stranded RNA and adenosine-rich oligonucleotides. The dsRNA is distributed among 10 segments with molecular weights of 2.7 x 10(6), 2.6 x 10(6), 1.7 x 10(6), 1.5 x 10(6), 1.3 x 10(6), 1.2 x 10(6), 0.80 x 10(6), 0.74 x 10(6), and 0.68 x 10(6) for the largest (L1) to the smallest (S4) segment, respectively, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These 10 segments migrate differently on polyacrylamide gels compared to those of human reovirus type 3. The capsid proteins of avian reovirus consist of eight species of polypeptides as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These are lambda1, lambda2, lambda3, mu1, mu2, sigma1, sigma2, and sigma3 with molecular weights of 140, 125, 115, 85, 72, 40, 36, and 32 x 10(3), respectively. Only polypeptide sigma2, which resides in the inner capsid or core, comigrated with the sigma2 polypeptide of type 3 reovirus. Antiserum against type 3 reovirus did not neutralize avian reovirus. Avian reovirus core particles were found to possess a transcriptase and a methylase activity.</jats:p>",0

Isolation and cloning of two variant papillomaviruses from domestic pigs: Sus scrofa papillomaviruses type 1 variants a and b,"<jats:p>The healthy skin of two female domestic pigs (<jats:italic>Sus scrofa domestica</jats:italic>) was sampled with cotton-tipped swabs. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the samples and subjected to PCR with degenerate papillomavirus (PV)-specific primers. Similarity searches performed with <jats:sc>blastn</jats:sc> showed that partial E1 and L1 sequences of two novel PVs were amplified. Subsequently, the complete genomes of these <jats:italic>Sus scrofa</jats:italic> papillomaviruses (SsPVs) were amplified by long-template PCR, cloned and sequenced using a transposon insertion method. They contained the typical PV open reading frames (ORFs) E1, E2, E4, E6, L1 and L2, but the E7 ORF was absent in both viruses. Pairwise nucleotide sequence alignment of the L1 ORFs of the SsPVs showed 98.5 % similarity, classifying these viruses as SsPV type 1 ‘variants’ (SsPV-1a and -1b). Based on a concatenated alignment of the E1, E2, L1 and L2 ORFs of SsPV-1 variants a and b, and 81 other human and animal PV type species, a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. This phylogenetic analysis showed that the SsPV-1a and -1b variants did not cluster with the other PVs of artiodactyls (cloven-hoofed) host species, but clustered on the edge of the genus <jats:italic>Alphapapillomavirus</jats:italic>, very near to the root of this genus.</jats:p>",0

Whole Genome Sequencing demonstrates that Geographic Variation of Escherichia coli O157 Genotypes Dominates Host Association,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Genetic variation in an infectious disease pathogen can be driven by ecological niche dissimilarities arising from different host species and different geographical locations. Whole genome sequencing was used to compare <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> O157 isolates from host reservoirs (cattle and sheep) from Scotland and to compare genetic variation of isolates (human, animal, environmental/food) obtained from Scotland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada and the USA. Nei’s genetic distance calculated from core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated that the animal isolates were from the same population. Investigation of the Shiga toxin bacteriophage and their insertion sites (SBI typing) revealed that cattle and sheep isolates had statistically indistinguishable rarefaction profiles, diversity and genotypes. In contrast, isolates from different countries exhibited significant differences in Nei’s genetic distance and SBI typing. Hence, after successful international transmission, which has occurred on multiple occasions, local genetic variation occurs, resulting in a global patchwork of continental and trans-continental phylogeographic clades. These findings are important for three reasons: first, understanding transmission and evolution of infectious diseases associated with multiple host reservoirs and multi-geographic locations; second, highlighting the relevance of the sheep reservoir when considering farm based interventions; and third, improving our understanding of why human disease incidence varies across the world.</jats:p>",0
Detection and Subtyping of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus in Infected Cattle by Polymerase chain Reaction and Amplified VP1 Sequencing,<jats:p> Fast and accurate detection of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks is needed to limit spread of the disease by proper vaccination. The use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has revolutionized the way in which viral diseases are diagnosed. Sequence analysis of the amplified VP1 sequence can enable the classification of FMD virus detected in the morbid animal. PCR assays were carried out to identify the virus and its serotype in suspect animals from 2 outbreaks of FMD type O virus. Sequence analysis of the amplified VP1 cDNA showed 78% homology with O1K and over 95% homology between the samples. These findings suggest that the 2 outbreaks were due to infection with the same virus serosubtype. </jats:p>,0

Characterization of H7N2 Avian Influenza Virus in Wild Birds and Pikas in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Area,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Qinghai Lake is a major migrating bird breeding site that has experienced several recent highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) epizootics. From 2006 to 2009 we studied Qinghai’s wild birds and pikas for evidence of AIV infections. We sampled 941 healthy wild animals and isolated seventeen H7N2 viruses (eight from pikas and nine from wild birds). The H7N2 viruses were phylogenetically closely related to each other and to viruses isolated in Hong Kong in the 1970s. We determined the pathogenicity of the H7N2 viruses by infecting chickens and mice. Our results suggest that pikas might play an important role in the ecology of AIVs, acting as intermediate hosts in which viruses become more adapted to mammals. Our findings of AI infection in pikas are consistent with previous observations and raise the possibility that pikas might play a previously unrecognized role in the ecology of AIVs peridomestic aquatic environments.</jats:p>",0
Overexpression of the Rybp Gene Inhibits Differentiation of Bovine Myoblasts into Myotubes,"<jats:p>RING1 and YY1 binding protein (Rybp) genes inhibit myogenesis in mice, but there are no reports on the effects of these genes in cattle. The aim of this study is to investigate the roles of the Rybp gene on bovine skeletal muscle development and myoblast differentiation. In the present study, the Rybp gene was overexpressed in bovine myoblasts via adenovirus. RNA-seq was performed to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The results showed that overexpressing the Rybp gene inhibits the formation of myotubes. The morphological differences in myoblasts began on the second day and were very significant 6 days after adenovirus induction. A total of 1311 (707 upregulated and 604 downregulated) DEGs were screened using RNA-seq between myoblasts with added negative control adenoviruses (AD-NC) and Rybp adenoviruses (AD-Rybp) after 6 days of induction. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis revealed that the downregulated DEGs were mainly involved in biological functions related to muscle, and, of the 32 pathways, those associated with muscle development were significantly enriched for the identified DEGs. This study can not only provide a theoretical basis for the regulation of skeletal muscle development in cattle by exploring the roles of the Rybp gene in myoblast differentiation, but it can also lay a theoretical foundation for molecular breeding of beef cattle.</jats:p>",0

Differentiation of respiratory syncytial virus subgroups with cDNA probes in a nucleic acid hybridization assay,"<jats:p>A new approach to respiratory syncytial (RS) virus subgroup determination was developed by using a simple nucleic acid filter hybridization technique. By this method, virus-infected cells are bound and fixed in a single step, and the viral RNA in the fixed-cell preparation is characterized directly by its ability to hybridize to cDNA probes specific for either the A or B subgroups of RS virus. The subgroup-specific probes were constructed from cDNA clones that corresponded to a portion of the extracellular domain of the RS virus G protein of either a subgroup B RS virus (8/60) or a subgroup A RS virus (A2). The cDNA probes were labeled with 32P and used to analyze RS virus isolates collected over a period of three decades. Replicate templates of infected cell preparations were hybridized with either the subgroup A or B probe. The subgroup assignments of 40 viruses tested by nucleic acid hybridization were in agreement with the results of subgroup determinations based on their reactivities with monoclonal antibodies, which previously has been the only method available for determining the subgroup classification of RS virus isolates. The nucleic acid hybridization assay has the advantage of providing broad-based discrimination of the two subgroups on the basis of nucleic acid homology, irrespective of minor antigenic differences that are detected in assays in which monoclonal antibodies are used. The nucleic acid hybridization technique provides a reliable method for RS virus subgroup characterization.</jats:p>",0

Epidemiological and genetic characteristics of swine pseudorabies virus in mainland China between 2012 and 2017,"<jats:p>The outbreak of pseudorabies (PR) in many Bartha-K61 vaccinated farms in China in late 2011 has seriously damaged the pig industry of one of the largest producers of pork products in the world. To understand the epidemiological characteristics of the pseudorabies virus (PRV) strains currently prevalent in China, a total of 16,256 samples collected from pig farms suspected of PRV infection in 27 Provinces of China between 2012 and 2017 were evaluated for detection of PRV. Since the extensive use of gE-deleted PRV vaccine in China, the PRV-gE was applied for determining wild-type virus infection by PCR. Of the 16,256 samples detected, approximately 1,345 samples were positive for the detection of PRV-gE, yielding an average positive rate of 8.27%. The positive rates of PRV detection from 2012 to 2017 were 11.92% (153/1284), 12.19% (225/1846), 6.70% (169/2523), 11.10% (269/2424), 5.57% (147/2640), and 6.90% (382/5539), respectively. To understand the genetic characteristics of the PRV strains currently circulating, 25 PRV strains isolated from those PRV-gE positive samples were selected for further investigation. Phylogenetic analysis based on gB, gC, and gE showed that PRV strains prevalent in China had a remarkably distinct evolutionary relationship with PRVs from other countries, which might explain the observation that Bartha-K61 vaccine was unable to provide full protection against emergent strains. Sequence alignments identified many amino acid changes within the gB, gC, and gE proteins of the PRVs circulating in China after the outbreak compared to those from other countries or those prevalent in China before the outbreak; those changes also might affect the protective efficacy of previously used vaccines in China, as well as being associated in part with the increased virulence of the current PRV epidemic strains in China.</jats:p>",0

Separate Evolution of Virulent Newcastle Disease Viruses from Mexico and Central America,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>An outbreak of Newcastle disease (ND) in poultry was reported in Belize in 2008. The characteristics of three virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates from this outbreak (NDV-Belize-3/08, NDV-Belize-4/08, and NDV-Belize-12/08) were assessed by genomic analysis and by clinicopathological characterization in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. The results showed that all three strains belong to NDV genotype V and are virulent, as assessed by the intracerebral pathogenicity index and the polybasic amino acid sequence at the fusion protein cleavage site. In 4-week-old SPF chickens, NDV-Belize-3/08 behaved as a typical velogenic viscerotropic NDV strain, causing severe necrohemorrhagic lesions in the lymphoid organs, with systemic virus distribution. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple NDV genotype V representatives revealed that genotype V can be divided into three subgenotypes, namely, Va, Vb, and Vc, and that all tested Belizean isolates belong to subgenotype Vb. Furthermore, these isolates are nearly identical to a 2007 isolate from Honduras and appear to have evolved separately from other contemporary viruses circulating in Mexico, clustering into a new clade within NDV subgenotype Vb.</jats:p>",0

A New Microplate Neutralization Test for Typing of Herpes Simplex Virus,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A microplate serum neutralization test for estimation of complement‐requiring neutralizing (CRN) antibody was established as the first step for simplification of typing of herpes simplex virus (HSV). When guinea pigs were immunized with type 2 HSV, the late sera could mostly differentiate the types of HSV better than hyperimmune rabbit sera, the CRN titer against the heterologous type 1 HSV being much lower than the homologous titer. Sera of guinea pigs immunized with type 1 HSV showed about the same level of cross reaction against type 2 HSV as did rabbit antisera. Guinea pig sera having minimal levels of cross reaction were selected, and their high dilution (1:160) and complement were added to serial 10‐fold dilutions of virus in the microplate titration of virus infectivity. Selective reduction of virus titer by either antiserum could determine the type of HSV. No equivocal intermediate case was found among a number of stock strains including many fresh isolates. The typing result coincided with that determined by a modification of Yang et al's method based on virus titers obtained with Vero and primary chick embryo cells. The typing based on plaquing in chick embryo cells sometimes failed to identify type 1 HSV.</jats:p>",0

Influenza A Viruses of Swine (IAV-S) in Vietnam from 2010 to 2015: Multiple Introductions of A(H1N1)pdm09 Viruses into the Pig Population and Diversifying Genetic Constellations of Enzootic IAV-S,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Active surveillance of influenza A viruses of swine (IAV-S) involving 262 farms and 10 slaughterhouses in seven provinces in northern and southern Vietnam from 2010 to 2015 yielded 388 isolates from 32 farms; these viruses were classified into H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes. Whole-genome sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates represented 15 genotypes, according to the genetic constellation of the eight segments. All of the H1N1 viruses were entirely A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, whereas all of the H1N2 and H3N2 viruses were reassortants among 5 distinct ancestral viruses: H1 and H3 triple-reassortant (TR) IAV-S that originated from North American pre-2009 human seasonal H1, human seasonal H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Notably, 93% of the reassortant IAV-S retained M genes that were derived from A(H1N1)pdm09, suggesting some advantage in terms of their host adaptation. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that multiple introductions of A(H1N1)pdm09 and TR IAV-S into the Vietnamese pig population have driven the genetic diversity of currently circulating Vietnamese IAV-S. In addition, our results indicate that a reassortant IAV-S with human-like H3 and N2 genes and an A(H1N1)pdm09 origin M gene likely caused a human case in Ho Chi Minh City in 2010. Our current findings indicate that human-to-pig transmission as well as cocirculation of different IAV-S have contributed to diversifying the gene constellations of IAV-S in Vietnam.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            This comprehensive genetic characterization of 388 influenza A viruses of swine (IAV-S) isolated through active surveillance of Vietnamese pig farms from 2010 through 2015 provides molecular epidemiological insight into the genetic diversification of IAV-S in Vietnam after the emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Multiple reassortments among A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and enzootic IAV-S yielded 14 genotypes, 9 of which carried novel gene combinations. The reassortants that carried M genes derived from A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses became predominant, replacing those of the IAV-S that had been endemic in Vietnam since 2011. Notably, one of the novel reassortants likely caused a human case in Vietnam. Given that Vietnam is the second-largest pig-producing country in Asia, continued monitoring of IAV-S is highly important from the viewpoints of both the swine industry and human public health.

Evaluation of the Broad-Range PCR-Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) System and Virus Microarrays for Virus Detection,"<jats:p>Advanced nucleic acid-based technologies are powerful research tools for novel virus discovery but need to be standardized for broader applications such as virus detection in biological products and clinical samples. We have used well-characterized retrovirus stocks to evaluate the limit of detection (LOD) for broad-range PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS or PLEX-ID), RT-PCR assays, and virus microarrays. The results indicated that in the absence of background cellular nucleic acids, PLEX-ID and RT-PCR had a similar LOD for xenotropic murine retrovirus-related virus (XMRV; 3.12 particles per µL) whereas sensitivity of virus detection was 10-fold greater using virus microarrays. When virus was spiked into a background of cellular nucleic acids, the LOD using PLEX-ID remained the same, whereas virus detection by RT-PCR was 10-fold less sensitive, and no virus could be detected by microarrays. Expected endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences were detected in cell lines tested and known species-specific viral sequences were detected in bovine serum and porcine trypsin. A follow-up strategy was developed using PCR amplification, nucleotide sequencing, and bioinformatics to demonstrate that an RD114-like retrovirus sequence that was detected by PLEX-ID in canine cell lines (Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Cf2Th canine thymus) was due to defective, endogenous gammaretrovirus-related sequences.</jats:p>",0

Suppression of Coronavirus Replication by Cyclophilin Inhibitors,"<jats:p>Coronaviruses infect a variety of mammalian and avian species and cause serious diseases in humans, cats, mice, and birds in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), mouse hepatitis, and avian infectious bronchitis, respectively. No effective vaccine or treatment has been developed for SARS-coronavirus or FIP virus, both of which cause lethal diseases. It has been reported that a cyclophilin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), could inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. CsA is a well-known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cellular cyclophilins to inhibit calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific phosphatase. The inhibition of calcineurin blocks the translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells from the cytosol into the nucleus, thus preventing the transcription of genes encoding cytokines such as interleukin-2. Cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl isomerases with physiological functions that have been described for many years to include chaperone and foldase activities. Also, many viruses require cyclophilins for replication; these include human immunodeficiency virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and hepatitis C virus. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the suppression of viral replication differ for different viruses. This review describes the suppressive effects of CsA on coronavirus replication.</jats:p>",0

Detection and characterization of two co-infection variant strains of avian orthoreovirus (ARV) in young layer chickens using next-generation sequencing (NGS),"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) for full genomic characterization studies of the newly emerging avian orthoreovirus (ARV) field strains isolated in Pennsylvania poultry, we identified two co-infection ARV variant strains from one ARV isolate obtained from ARV-affected young layer chickens. The de novo assembly of the ARV reads generated 19 contigs of two different ARV variant strains according to 10 genome segments of each ARV strain. The two variants had the same M2 segment. The complete genomes of each of the two variant strains were 23,493 bp in length and 10 dsRNA segments ranged from 1192 bp (S4) to 3958 bp (L1), encoding 12 viral proteins. Sequence comparison of nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequences of all 10 genome segments revealed 58.1–100% and 51.4–100% aa identity between the two variant strains and 54.3–89.4% and 49.5–98.1% aa identity between the two variants and classic vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a moderate to significant nt sequence divergence between the two variant and ARV reference strains. These findings have demonstrated the first naturally occurring co-infection of two ARV variants in commercial young layer chickens, providing scientific evidence that multiple ARV strains can be simultaneously present in one host species of chickens.</jats:p>",0

Combining Comprehensive Analysis of Off-Site Lambda Phage Integration with a CRISPR-Based Means of Characterizing Downstream Physiology,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            During its lysogenic life cycle, the phage genome is integrated into the host chromosome by site-specific recombination. In this report, we analyze lambda phage integration into noncanonical sites using next-generation sequencing and show that it generates significant genetic diversity by targeting over 300 unique sites in the host

            genome. Moreover, these integration events can have important phenotypic consequences for the host, including changes in cell motility and increased antibiotic resistance. Importantly, the new technologies that we developed to enable this study—sequencing secondary sites using next-generation sequencing and then selecting relevant lysogens using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-based selection—are broadly applicable to other phage-bacterium systems.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Bacteriophages play an important role in bacterial evolution through lysogeny, where the phage genome is integrated into the host chromosome. While phage integration generally occurs at a specific site in the host chromosome, it is also known to occur at other, so-called secondary sites. In this study, we developed a new experimental technology to comprehensively study secondary integration sites and discovered that phage can integrate into over 300 unique sites in the host genome, resulting in significant genetic diversity in bacteria. We further developed an assay to examine the phenotypic consequence of such diverse integration events and found that phage integration can cause changes in evolutionarily relevant traits such as bacterial motility and increases in antibiotic resistance. Importantly, our method is readily applicable to other phage-bacterium systems.

Viral Metagenomics on Animals as a Tool for the Detection of Zoonoses Prior to Human Infection?,"<jats:p>Many human viral infections have a zoonotic, i.e., wild or domestic animal, origin. Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly via contact with an animal or indirectly via exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of  a bloodsucking arthropod. If a virus is able to adapt and replicate in its new human host, human-to-human transmissions may occur, possibly resulting in an epidemic, such as  the A/H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. Thus, predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important challenge for public health officials in the coming decades. The recent development of viral metagenomics, i.e., the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or an environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, is promising for the surveillance of such diseases and can be accomplished by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and arthropods that are closely in contact with humans. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity within such animals (in particular blood-feeding arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present its possible future application for the surveillance of zoonotic and arboviral diseases.</jats:p>",0

The capacities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics were investigated here. First, cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were already detected at 7 seconds after start of sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3 h. Next, diarrheic feces of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed. Almost all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages, which may have reshaped the piglet’s microbiome. Contigs matched <jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Escherichia</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Enterococcus</jats:italic> phages. Moreover, porcine kobuvirus was discovered in the feces for the first time in Belgium. Suckling piglets shed kobuvirus from one week of age, but an association between peak of viral shedding (10<jats:sup>6.42</jats:sup>–10<jats:sup>7.01</jats:sup> copies/swab) and diarrheic signs was not observed during a follow-up study. Retrospective analysis showed the widespread (n = 25, 56.8% positive) of genetically moderately related kobuviruses among Belgian diarrheic piglets. MinION enables rapid detection of enteric viruses. Such new methodologies will change diagnostics, but more extensive validations should be conducted. The true enteric pathogenicity of porcine kobuvirus should be questioned, while its subclinical importance cannot be excluded.</jats:p>",0

            Ticks are implicated as vectors of a wide array of human and animal pathogens. To better understand the extent of tick-borne diseases, it is crucial to uncover the full range of microbial agents associated with ticks. Our current knowledge of the diversity of tick-associated viruses is limited, in part due to the lack of investigation of tick viromes. In this study, we examined the viromes of three tick species from the United States. We found that ticks are hosts to highly divergent viruses across several taxa, including ones previously associated with human disease. Our data underscore the diversity of tick-associated viruses and provide the foundation for further studies into viral etiology of tick-borne diseases.

Detection and Heterogeneity of Herpesviruses Causing Pacheco's Disease in Parrots,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Pacheco's disease (PD) is a common, often fatal, disease of parrots. We cloned a virus isolate from a parrot that had characteristic lesions of PD. Three viral clones were partially sequenced, demonstrating that this virus was an alphaherpesvirus most closely related to the gallid herpesvirus 1. Five primer sets were developed from these sequences. The primer sets were used with PCR to screen tissues or tissue culture media suspected to contain viruses from 54 outbreaks of PD. The primer sets amplified DNA from all but one sample. Ten amplification patterns were detected, indicating that PD is caused by a genetically heterogeneous population of viruses. A single genetic variant (psittacid herpesvirus variant 1) amplified with all primer sets and was the most common virus variant (62.7%). A single primer set (23F) amplified DNA from all of the positive samples, suggesting that PCR could be used as a rapid postmortem assay for these viruses. PCR was found to be significantly more sensitive than tissue culture for the detection of psittacid herpesviruses.</jats:p>",0
Molecular Phylogeny of the Psittacid Herpesviruses Causing Pacheco's Disease: Correlation of Genotype with Phenotypic Expression,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Fragments of 419 bp of the UL16 open reading frame from 73 psittacid herpesviruses (PsHVs) from the United States and Europe were sequenced. All viruses caused Pacheco's disease, and serotypes of the European isolates were known. A phylogenetic tree derived from these sequences demonstrated that the PsHVs that cause Pacheco's disease comprised four major genotypes, with each genotype including between two and four variants. With the exception of two viruses, the serotypes of the virus isolates could be predicted by the genotypes. Genotypes 1 and 4 corresponded to serotype 1 isolates, genotype 2 corresponded to serotype 2 isolates, and genotype 3 corresponded to serotype 3 isolates. The single serotype 4 virus mapped to genotype 4. DNA from a virus with a unique serotype could not be amplified with primers that amplified DNA from all other PsHVs, and its classification remains unknown. Viruses representing all four genotypes were found in both the United States and Europe, and it was therefore predicted that serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were present in the United States. Serotype 4 was represented by a single European isolate that could not be genetically distinguished from serotype 1 viruses; therefore, the presence of serotype 4 in the United States could not be predicted. Viruses of genotype 4 were found to be the most commonly associated with Pacheco's disease in macaws and conures and were least likely to be isolated in chicken embryo fibroblasts in the United States. All four genotypes caused deaths in Amazon parrots, but genotype 4 was associated with Pacheco's disease only in Amazons in Europe.

Characterization of the Dynamic Transcriptome of a Herpesvirus with Long-read Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Herpesvirus gene expression is co-ordinately regulated and sequentially ordered during productive infection. The viral genes can be classified into three distinct kinetic groups: immediate-early, early, and late classes. In this study, a massively parallel sequencing technique that is based on PacBio Single Molecule Real-time sequencing platform, was used for quantifying the poly(A) fraction of the lytic transcriptome of pseudorabies virus (PRV) throughout a 12-hour interval of productive infection on PK-15 cells. Other approaches, including microarray, real-time RT-PCR and Illumina sequencing are capable of detecting only the aggregate transcriptional activity of particular genomic regions, but not individual herpesvirus transcripts. However, SMRT sequencing allows for a distinction between transcript isoforms, including length- and splice variants, as well as between overlapping polycistronic RNA molecules. The non-amplified Isoform Sequencing (Iso-Seq) method was used to analyse the kinetic properties of the lytic PRV transcripts and to then classify them accordingly. Additionally, the present study demonstrates the general utility of long-read sequencing for the time-course analysis of global gene expression in practically any organism.</jats:p>",0

An Evolutionarily Young Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus) Endogenous Retrovirus Identified from Next Generation Sequence Data,"<jats:p>Transcriptome analysis of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) tissues identified sequences with similarity to Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV). Based on these sequences, four proviral copies and 15 solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) of a newly described endogenous retrovirus were characterized from the polar bear draft genome sequence. Closely related sequences were identified by PCR analysis of brown bear (Ursus arctos) and black bear (Ursus americanus) but were absent in non-Ursinae bear species. The virus was therefore designated UrsusERV. Two distinct groups of LTRs were observed including a recombinant ERV that contained one LTR belonging to each group indicating that genomic invasions by at least two UrsusERV variants have recently occurred. Age estimates based on proviral LTR divergence and conservation of integration sites among ursids suggest the viral group is only a few million years old. The youngest provirus was polar bear specific, had intact open reading frames (ORFs) and could potentially encode functional proteins. Phylogenetic analyses of UrsusERV consensus protein sequences suggest that it is part of a pig, gibbon and koala retrovirus clade. The young age estimates and lineage specificity of the virus suggests UrsusERV is a recent cross species transmission from an unknown reservoir and places the viral group among the youngest of ERVs identified in mammals.</jats:p>",0

A Novel Activation Mechanism of Avian Influenza Virus H9N2 by Furin,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Avian influenza virus H9N2 is prevalent in waterfowl and has become endemic in poultry in Asia and the Middle East. H9N2 influenza viruses have served as a reservoir of internal genes for other avian influenza viruses that infect humans, and several cases of human infection by H9N2 influenza viruses have indicated its pandemic potential. Fortunately, an extensive surveillance program enables close monitoring of H9N2 influenza viruses worldwide and has generated a large repository of virus sequences and phylogenetic information. Despite the large quantity of sequences in different databases, very little is known about specific virus isolates and their pathogenesis. Here, we characterize a low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus, A/chicken/Israel/810/2001 (H9N2) (Israel810), which is representative of influenza virus strains that have caused severe morbidity and mortality in poultry farms. We show that under certain circumstances the Israel810 hemagglutinin (HA) can be activated by furin, a hallmark of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. We demonstrate that Israel810 HA can be cleaved in cells with high levels of furin expression and that a mutation that eliminates a glycosylation site in HA
            <jats:sub>1</jats:sub>
            allows the Israel810 HA to gain universal cleavage in cell culture. Pseudoparticles generated from Israel810 HA, or the glycosylation mutant, transduce cells efficiently. In contrast, introduction of a polybasic cleavage site into Israel810 HA leads to pseudoviruses that are compromised for transduction. Our data indicate a mechanism for an H9N2 evolutionary pathway that may allow it to gain virulence in a distinct manner from H5 and H7 influenza viruses.

Evidence of serologic diversity within group C rotaviruses,"<jats:p>The Cowden strain of porcine group C rotavirus and the Shintoku strain of bovine group C rotavirus were classified as different serotypes by two-way cross-neutralization tests. Two neutralization patterns against the Cowden and Shintoku strains were observed when hyperimmune or convalescent-phase antisera to three noncultivatable porcine group C rotaviruses and a human group C rotavirus were used in one-way cross-neutralization tests. Antisera to two porcine group C rotaviruses and the human group C rotavirus neutralized the Cowden strain at high titers but did not neutralize the Shintoku strain, suggesting that these three strains are serotypically related to the Cowden strain. The remaining antisera to a porcine group C rotavirus (HF strain) reacted with the Cowden and Shintoku group C rotaviruses in cell culture immunofluorescence tests but did not neutralize either virus in one-way cross-neutralization, suggesting that the HF strain belongs to a third serotype. However, confirmation of these findings requires additional analysis by two-way cross-neutralization. Our findings support the existence of at least two distinct serotypes of group C rotaviruses, and possibly a third, among animals and humans. The serotypic similarity observed between the Cowden strain and a human group C rotavirus suggests that the cultivatable Cowden strain and antiserum to this virus may provide important reagents for the diagnosis of group C rotaviruses in humans.</jats:p>",0
"Porcine rotavirus C in pigs with gastroenteritis on Thai swine farms, 2011–2016","<jats:p>Swine are economically important food animals, but highly contagious porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and rotavirus can afflict pig herds and contribute significantly to piglet morbidity and mortality. While there have been studies on rotavirus group A (RVA) in Thailand, reports of rotavirus group C (RVC) are limited. Here, we aimed to identify the prevalence of RVC circulating on Thai commercial swine farms. We analyzed 769 feces and intestine mucosal contents of pigs affected with diarrhea between 2011 and 2016 using RT-PCR specific for the PEDV spike (S), rotavirus glycoprotein (G) VP7, and protease-sensitive protein (P) VP4 genes. We found that 6.6% (51/769) of samples tested positive for RVC, of which 11 samples were co-infected with RVA and four samples were co-infected with PEDV. Three samples tested positive for all three viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene showed that the most frequent RVC genotype was G1, which grouped with the prototypic RVC Cowden strain. While G6 and G9 were also common, G3 was relatively rare. Analysis of the VP4 gene revealed that the most common P type was P[5], followed by P[4], P[7], and P[1]. In all, there were six G/P combinations (G6P[5], G1P[1], G1P[4], G1P[5], G9P[4], and G9P[7]), of which G6P[5] was the most predominant.</jats:p>",0

A more exhaustive analysis of JEV evolution using 107 envelope sequences available for isolates from different geographic locations worldwide revealed five distinct genotypes of JEV, displaying a minimum nucleotide divergence of 7% with high bootstrap support values. The tree also revealed overall clustering of strains based on geographic location, as well as multiple introductions of JEV into the Indian subcontinent. Nonsynonymous nucleotide divergence rates of the envelope gene estimated that the ancestor common to all JEV genotypes arose within the last three hundred years.</jats:p>",0

Molecular epidemiology of Newcastle disease virus isolates from vaccinated commercial poultry farms in non-epidemic areas of Japan,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Newcastle Disease (ND) is a highly contagious and economically devastating disease of poultry. At present, limited molecular epidemiological data are available regarding the causes of ND outbreaks in vaccinated commercial poultry farms. Knowing the genomic characteristics of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infecting commercial poultry operations in spite of vaccination might give important insights on the infection dynamics of these viruses. In addition, molecular analyses at the subgenotype level and studies on the relationship of Japanese NDVs with other isolates from around the world are lacking. Therefore, in the present study, a molecular epidemiological investigation was conducted to characterize nine NDVs isolated from vaccinated commercial poultry flocks in five different Prefectures in non-epidemic areas of Japan between 1969 and 2002.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic studies were performed to characterize the complete fusion (F)-protein gene, 3-prime end of the nucleoprotein (NP)-gene and 5-prime end of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L)-gene. Sequence data were compared with 180 NDV strains from GenBank representing different NDV genotypes and subgenotypes from different regions of the world at different time periods. Deduced amino acids were analyzed for homologies, recombination and mutation. Recombination events were estimated using Recombination Detection Program (RDP) version 3.44. Phylogenetic trees were constructed to determine evolutionary relationships among strains.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Mean death time (MDT: 48-56 hr), Intracerebral Pathogenicity Index (ICPI: 1.7-1.9) and deduced amino acid sequences of the F0 proteolytic cleavage site (<jats:sup>112</jats:sup>RRQKR<jats:sup>116</jats:sup>) revealed that all nine field isolates were velogenic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates could be classified into two genetic lineages and three sublineages namely genotypes VIa (lineage 4a), VId (lineage 4d) and VIId (lineage 5d). No recombination events were observed but a point mutation in one of the neutralizing epitope of the F-protein was identified in the field isolates from Japan.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>All field isolates from vaccinated commercial poultry in non-epidemic areas of Japan were part of much bigger outbreaks in provinces and regions and, in some cases, continents. In general, four ND panzootics occurred in Japan and that these outbreaks were mostly characterized by co-circulation of genetically distinct virus lineages due to involvements of infected wild birds. The point mutation identified in the field isolates from Japan may be due to escape from vaccine pressure. The identification of such mutation may be useful for future site-directed mutagenesis to understand the dynamics of NDV infection in vaccinated chickens.</jats:p>

"Epidemiology of two human protoparvoviruses, bufavirus and tusavirus","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Two human parvoviruses were recently discovered by metagenomics in Africa, bufavirus (BuV) in 2012 and tusavirus (TuV) in 2014. These viruses have been studied exclusively by PCR in stool and detected only in patients with diarrhoea, although at low prevalence. Three genotypes of BuV have been identified. We detected, by in-house EIA, BuV1-3 IgG antibodies in 7/228 children (3.1%) and 10/180 adults (5.6%), whereas TuV IgG was found in one child (0.4%). All children and 91% of the adults were Finnish, yet interestingly 3/6 adults of Indian origin were BuV-IgG positive. By competition EIA, no cross-reactivity between the BuVs was detected, indicating that the BuV genotypes represent distinct serotypes. Furthermore, we analysed by BuV qPCR stool and nasal swab samples from 955 children with gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, or both, and found BuV DNA in three stools (0.3%) and for the first time in a nasal swab (0.1%). This is the first study documenting the presence of BuV and TuV antibodies in humans. Although the seroprevalences of both viruses were low in Finland, our results indicate that BuV infections might be widespread in Asia. The BuV-specific humoral immune responses appeared to be strong and long-lasting, pointing to systemic infection in humans.</jats:p>",0

            Strain superinfection occurs when a second pathogen strain infects a host already infected with a primary strain.

"Complete nucleotide sequence of the new simian T-lymphotropic virus, STLV-PH969 from a Hamadryas baboon, and unusual features of its long terminal repeat","<jats:p>A third type of primate T-lymphotropic virus, PTLV-L, with STLV-PH969 as a prototype, has recently been isolated from an African baboon (Papio hamadryas). Classification of this virus has been based on partial sequence analysis of cDNA from a virus-producing cell line, PH969. We obtained the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus with a proviral genome of 8,916 bp. All major genes, homologous in all human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-related viruses, and their corresponding mRNAs, including appropriate splicing, were identified. One additional nonhomologous open reading frame in the proximal pX region is accessible for translation through alternative splicing. Sequence comparison shows that STLV-PH969 is equidistantly related to HTLV type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2. In all coding regions, the similarity tends to be the lowest between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-1. However, in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region, the lowest similarity was found between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-2. The U3-R and R-U5 boundaries of the STLV-PH969 LTR were experimentally determined at nucleotides 268 and 524, respectively. This 695-bp LTR is 60 and 73 bp shorter than the LTRs of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively, but its general organization is similar to the one found in the HTLV-bovine leukemia virus genus. In the long region between the polyadenylation signal and the poly(A) site, sequence similarity with the HTLV-1 Rex-responsive element (RexRE) core and secondary structure prediction suggest the presence of a RexRE. The presence of three 21-bp repeats is conserved within the U3 region of HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and BLV. Only two direct repeats with similarity to these Tax-responsive elements were found in the STLV-PH969 LTR, which might suggest differences in the Tax-mediated transactivation of this virus. We conclude that STLV-PH969 has all the genes and genomic regions to suggest a replication cycle comparable to that of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.</jats:p>",0

An Ecological and Conservation Perspective on Advances in the Applied Virology of Zoonoses,"<jats:p>The aim of this manuscript is to describe how modern advances in our knowledge of viruses and viral evolution can be applied to the fields of disease ecology and conservation. We review recent progress in virology and provide examples of how it is informing both empirical research in field ecology and applied conservation. We include a discussion of needed breakthroughs and ways to bridge communication gaps between the field and the lab. In an effort to foster this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table that lists the definitions of key terms. The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to both assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies. In conclusion, we highlight the need for smart surveillance, viral discovery efforts and predictive modeling. A shift towards a predictive approach is necessary in today’s globalized society because, as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, identification post-emergence is often too late to prevent global spread. Integrating molecular virology and ecological techniques will allow for earlier recognition of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they jump from wildlife reservoirs into human or livestock populations and cause serious public health or conservation issues.</jats:p>",0

Avian Influenza Viruses in Wild Birds: Virus Evolution in a Multihost Ecosystem,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Wild ducks and gulls are the major reservoirs for avian influenza A viruses (AIVs). The mechanisms that drive AIV evolution are complex at sites where various duck and gull species from multiple flyways breed, winter, or stage. The Republic of Georgia is located at the intersection of three migratory flyways: the Central Asian flyway, the East Africa/West Asia flyway, and the Black Sea/Mediterranean flyway. For six complete study years (2010 to 2016), we collected AIV samples from various duck and gull species that breed, migrate, and overwinter in Georgia. We found a substantial subtype diversity of viruses that varied in prevalence from year to year. Low-pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) subtypes included H1N1, H2N3, H2N5, H2N7, H3N8, H4N2, H6N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N1, H9N3, H10N4, H10N7, H11N1, H13N2, H13N6, H13N8, and H16N3, and two highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs) belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, H5N5 and H5N8, were found. Whole-genome phylogenetic trees showed significant host species lineage restriction for nearly all gene segments and significant differences in observed reassortment rates, as defined by quantification of phylogenetic incongruence, and in nucleotide sequence diversity for LPAIVs among different host species. Hemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses, which circulated in Eurasia during 2014 and 2015, did not reassort, but analysis after their subsequent dissemination during 2016 and 2017 revealed reassortment in all gene segments except NP and NS. Some virus lineages appeared to be unrelated to AIVs in wild bird populations in other regions, with maintenance of local AIVs in Georgia, whereas other lineages showed considerable genetic interrelationships with viruses circulating in other parts of Eurasia and Africa, despite relative undersampling in the area.</jats:p>

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Waterbirds (e.g., gulls and ducks) are natural reservoirs of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and have been shown to mediate the dispersal of AIVs at intercontinental scales during seasonal migration. The segmented genome of influenza viruses enables viral RNA from different lineages to mix or reassort when two viruses infect the same host. Such reassortant viruses have been identified in most major human influenza pandemics and several poultry outbreaks. Despite their importance, we have only recently begun to understand AIV evolution and reassortment in their natural host reservoirs. This comprehensive study illustrates AIV evolutionary dynamics within a multihost ecosystem at a stopover site where three major migratory flyways intersect. Our analysis of this ecosystem over a 6-year period provides a snapshot of how these viruses are linked to global AIV populations. Understanding the evolution of AIVs in the natural host is imperative to mitigating both the risk of incursion into domestic poultry and the potential risk to mammalian hosts, including humans.

"The Capacity of UL49.5 Proteins To Inhibit TAP Is Widely Distributed among Members of the Genus
            <i>Varicellovirus</i>","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            The lifelong infection by varicelloviruses is characterized by a fine balance between the host immune response and immune evasion strategies used by these viruses. Virus-derived peptides are presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transports the peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum, where the loading of MHC-I molecules occurs. The varicelloviruses bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), pseudorabies virus, and equid herpesviruses 1 and 4 have been found to encode a UL49.5 protein that inhibits TAP-mediated peptide transport. To investigate to what extent UL49.5-mediated TAP inhibition is conserved within the family of
            <jats:italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</jats:italic>
            , the homologs of another five varicelloviruses, one mardivirus, and one iltovirus were studied. The UL49.5 proteins of BoHV-5, bubaline herpesvirus 1, cervid herpesvirus 1, and felid herpesvirus 1 were identified as potent TAP inhibitors. The varicella-zoster virus and simian varicellovirus UL49.5 proteins fail to block TAP; this is not due to the absence of viral cofactors that might assist in this process, since cells infected with these viruses did not show reduced TAP function either. The UL49.5 homologs of the mardivirus Marek's disease virus 1 and the iltovirus infectious laryngotracheitis virus did not block TAP, suggesting that the capacity to inhibit TAP via UL49.5 has been acquired by varicelloviruses only. A phylogenetic analysis of viruses that inhibit TAP through their UL49.5 proteins reveals an interesting hereditary pattern, pointing toward the presence of this capacity in defined clades within the genus

Metagenomics detection and characterisation of viruses in faecal samples from Australian wild birds,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We present an optimised metagenomics method for detection and characterisation of all virus types including single and double stranded DNA/RNA and enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Initial evaluation included both spiked and non-spiked bird faecal samples as well as non-spiked human faecal samples. From the non-spiked bird samples (Australian Muscovy duck and Pacific black ducks) we detected 21 viruses, and we also present a summary of a few viruses detected in human faecal samples. We then present a detailed analysis of selected virus sequences in the avian samples that were somewhat similar to known viruses, and had good quality (Q20 or higher) and quantity of next-generation sequencing reads, and was of interest from a virological point of view, for example, avian coronavirus and avian paramyxovirus 6. Some of these viruses were closely related to known viruses while others were more distantly related with 70% or less identity to currently known/sequenced viruses. Besides detecting viruses, the technique also allowed the characterisation of host mitochondrial DNA present and thus identifying host species, while ribosomal RNA sequences provided insight into the “ribosomal activity microbiome”; of gut parasites; and of food eaten such as plants or insects, which we correlated to non-avian host associated viruses.</jats:p>",0
Metagenomic Analyses of Viruses in Stool Samples from Children with Acute Flaccid Paralysis,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            We analyzed viral nucleic acids in stool samples collected from 35 South Asian children with nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Sequence-independent reverse transcription and PCR amplification of capsid-protected, nuclease-resistant viral nucleic acids were followed by DNA sequencing and sequence similarity searches. Limited Sanger sequencing (35 to 240 subclones per sample) identified an average of 1.4 distinct eukaryotic viruses per sample, while pyrosequencing yielded 2.6 viruses per sample. In addition to bacteriophage and plant viruses, we detected known enteric viruses, including rotavirus, adenovirus, picobirnavirus, and human enterovirus species A (HEV-A) to HEV-C, as well as numerous other members of the
            <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>

Viral Nucleic Acids in Live-Attenuated Vaccines: Detection of Minority Variants and an Adventitious Virus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Metagenomics and a panmicrobial microarray were used to examine eight live-attenuated viral vaccines. Viral nucleic acids in trivalent oral poliovirus (OPV), rubella, measles, yellow fever, varicella-zoster, multivalent measles/mumps/rubella, and two rotavirus live vaccines were partially purified, randomly amplified, and pyrosequenced. Over half a million sequence reads were generated covering from 20 to 99% of the attenuated viral genomes at depths reaching up to 8,000 reads per nucleotides. Mutations and minority variants, relative to vaccine strains, not known to affect attenuation were detected in OPV, mumps virus, and varicella-zoster virus. The anticipated detection of endogenous retroviral sequences from the producer avian and primate cells was confirmed. Avian leukosis virus (ALV), previously shown to be noninfectious for humans, was present as RNA in viral particles, while simian retrovirus (SRV) was present as genetically defective DNA. Rotarix, an orally administered rotavirus vaccine, contained porcine circovirus-1 (PCV1), a highly prevalent nonpathogenic pig virus, which has not been shown to be infectious in humans. Hybridization of vaccine nucleic acids to a panmicrobial microarray confirmed the presence of endogenous retroviral and PCV1 nucleic acids. Deep sequencing and microarrays can therefore detect attenuated virus sequence changes, minority variants, and adventitious viruses and help maintain the current safety record of live-attenuated viral vaccines.</jats:p>",0

Complete Genomic Sequence of Human Coronavirus OC43: Molecular Clock Analysis Suggests a Relatively Recent Zoonotic Coronavirus Transmission Event,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of approximately 30 kb. Based on genetic similarities, coronaviruses are classified into three groups. Two group 2 coronaviruses, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), show remarkable antigenic and genetic similarities. In this study, we report the first complete genome sequence (30,738 nucleotides) of the prototype HCoV-OC43 strain (ATCC VR759). Complete genome and open reading frame (ORF) analyses were performed in comparison to the BCoV genome. In the region between the spike and membrane protein genes, a 290-nucleotide deletion is present, corresponding to the absence of BCoV ORFs ns4.9 and ns4.8. Nucleotide and amino acid similarity percentages were determined for the major HCoV-OC43 ORFs and for those of other group 2 coronaviruses. The highest degree of similarity is demonstrated between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV in all ORFs with the exception of the E gene. Molecular clock analysis of the spike gene sequences of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 suggests a relatively recent zoonotic transmission event and dates their most recent common ancestor to around 1890. An evolutionary rate in the order of 4 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup>nucleotide changes per site per year was estimated. This is the first animal-human zoonotic pair of coronaviruses that can be analyzed in order to gain insights into the processes of adaptation of a nonhuman coronavirus to a human host, which is important for understanding the interspecies transmission events that led to the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak.</jats:p>",0

Hepatitis E Virus Genotype 3 Diversity: Phylogenetic Analysis and Presence of Subtype 3b in Wild Boar in Europe,"<jats:p>An increasing number of indigenous cases of hepatitis E caused by genotype  3 viruses (HEV-3) have been diagnosed all around the word, particularly in industrialized countries. Hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease and accumulating evidence indicates that  domestic pigs and wild boars are the main reservoirs of HEV-3. A detailed analysis of  HEV-3 subtypes could help to determine the interplay of human activity, the role of animals as reservoirs and cross species transmission. Although complete genome sequences are most appropriate for HEV subtype determination, in most cases only partial genomic sequences are available. We therefore carried out a subtype classification analysis, which uses regions from all three open reading frames of the genome. Using this approach, more than 1000 published HEV-3 isolates were subtyped. Newly recovered HEV partial sequences from hunted German wild boars were also included in this study. These sequences were assigned to genotype 3 and clustered within subtype 3a, 3i and, unexpectedly, one of them within the subtype 3b, a first non-human report of this subtype in Europe.</jats:p>",0
Investigation of Human Cancers for Retrovirus by Low-Stringency Target Enrichment and High-Throughput Sequencing,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although nearly one fifth of all human cancers have an infectious aetiology, the causes for the majority of cancers remain unexplained. Despite the enormous data output from high-throughput shotgun sequencing, viral DNA in a clinical sample typically constitutes a proportion of host DNA that is too small to be detected. Sequence variation among virus genomes complicates application of sequence-specific and highly sensitive, PCR methods. Therefore, we aimed to develop and characterize a method that permits sensitive detection of sequences despite considerable variation. We demonstrate that our low-stringency in-solution hybridization method enables detection of &lt;100 viral copies. Furthermore, distantly related proviral sequences may be enriched by orders of magnitude, enabling discovery of hitherto unknown viral sequences by high-throughput sequencing. The sensitivity was sufficient to detect retroviral sequences in clinical samples. We used this method to conduct an investigation for novel retrovirus in samples from three cancer types. In accordance with recent studies our investigation revealed no retroviral infections in human B-cell lymphoma cells, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or colorectal cancer biopsies. Nonetheless, our generally applicable method makes sensitive detection possible and permits sequencing of distantly related sequences from complex material.</jats:p>",0

Experimental infection of conventional nursing pigs and their dams with <i>Porcine deltacoronavirus</i>,"<jats:p> Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly identified virus that has been detected in swine herds of North America associated with enteric disease. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the pathogenicity, course of infection, virus kinetics, and aerosol transmission of PDCoV using 87 conventional piglets and their 9 dams, including aerosol and contact controls to emulate field conditions. Piglets 2–4 days of age and their dams were administered an oronasal PDCoV inoculum with a quantitative real-time reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR quantification cycle (Cq) value of 22 that was generated from a field sample having 100% nucleotide identity to USA/Illinois121/2014 determined by metagenomic sequencing and testing negative for other enteric disease agents using standard assays. Serial samples of blood, serum, oral fluids, nasal and fecal swabs, and tissues from sequential autopsy, conducted daily on days 1–8 and regular intervals thereafter, were collected throughout the 42-day study for qRT-PCR, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Diarrhea developed in all inoculated and contact control pigs, including dams, by 2 days post-inoculation (dpi) and in aerosol control pigs and dams by 3–4 dpi, with resolution occurring by 12 dpi. Mild to severe atrophic enteritis with PDCoV antigen staining was observed in the small intestine of affected piglets from 2 to 8 dpi. Mesenteric lymph node and small intestine were the primary sites of antigen detection by immunohistochemistry, and virus RNA was detected in these tissues to the end of the study. Virus RNA was detectable in piglet fecal swabs to 21 dpi, and dams to 14–35 dpi. </jats:p>",0
Novel hemotropic mycoplasmas are widespread and genetically diverse in vampire bats,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Bats (Order: Chiroptera) have been widely studied as reservoir hosts for viruses of concern for human and animal health. However, whether bats are equally competent hosts of non-viral pathogens such as bacteria remains an important open question. Here, we surveyed blood and saliva samples of vampire bats from Peru and Belize for hemotropic <jats:italic>Mycoplasma</jats:italic> spp. (hemoplasmas), bacteria that can cause inapparent infection or anemia in hosts. 16S rRNA gene amplification of blood showed 67% (150/223) of common vampire bats (<jats:italic>Desmodus rotundus</jats:italic>) were infected by hemoplasmas. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed three novel genotypes that were phylogenetically related but not identical to hemoplasmas described from other (non-vampire) bat species, rodents, humans, and non-human primates. Hemoplasma prevalence in vampire bats was highest in non-reproductive and young individuals, did not differ by country, and was relatively stable over time (i.e., endemic). Metagenomics from pooled <jats:italic>D. rotundus</jats:italic> saliva from Peru detected non-hemotropic <jats:italic>Mycoplasma</jats:italic> species and hemoplasma genotypes phylogenetically similar to those identified in blood, providing indirect evidence for potential direct transmission of hemoplasmas through biting or social contacts. This study demonstrates vampire bats host several novel hemoplasmas and sheds light on risk factors for infection and basic transmission routes. Given the high frequency of direct contacts that arise when vampire bats feed on humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, the potential of these bacteria to be transmitted between species should be investigated in future work.</jats:p>",0

"99th Dahlem Conference on Infection, Inflammation and Chronic Inflammatory Disorders: Farm lifestyles and the hygiene hypothesis","<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>
               <jats:p>About 15 years have gone by since Strachan first proposed the idea that infections and unhygienic contact may confer protection from the development of allergic illnesses. The so-called ‘hygiene hypothesis’ has since undergone numerous modifications in the field of epidemiology, clinical science and immunology. Three main areas of research have been brought forward: to explore the role of overt viral and bacterial infections for the inception of allergic diseases; to investigate the significance of environmental exposure to microbial compounds on the development of allergies; and to study the effect of both exposures on underlying innate and adaptive immune responses. A concept unifying these various aspects has not been found, but various pieces of a complex interplay between immune responses of the host, characteristics of the invading microorganism, the level and variety of the environmental exposure and the interactions between an exposed subject's genetic background and the environmental exposures becomes apparent. A natural experiment relating to the hygiene hypothesis is the recurrent observation of a protective effect of growing up on a farm for asthma and allergies. This has been shown in a large number of epidemiological studies across the world among children and adults. The timing and duration of exposure are likely to play a critical role. The largest reduction in risk has been demonstrated for those exposed prenatally and continuously thereafter until adulthood. The protective factors in these farming environments have not been unravelled completely. Findings from various studies suggest that the contact with farm animals, at least in childhood, confers protection. Also the consumption of unprocessed cow's milk directly from the farm has been shown to protect from childhood asthma and allergies. Increased levels of microbial substances may, at least in part, contribute to the ‘farm effect’. However, only few studies have measured microbial exposures in these environments and the results obtained so far suggest that the underlying protective microbial exposure(s) have not been identified, but a number of studies using metagenomic approaches are currently under way. The mechanisms by which such environmental exposures confer protection from respiratory allergies are also not well understood. There is good evidence for the involvement of innate immune responses, but translation into protective mechanisms for asthma and allergies is lacking. Furthermore, a number of gene × environment interactions have been observed.</jats:p>",0
The Possible Role That Buffalo Played in the Recent Outbreaks of Foot‐and‐Mouth Disease in South Africa,"<jats:p><jats:bold>A<jats:sc>bstract</jats:sc>: </jats:bold> African buffalo (<jats:italic>Syncerus caffer</jats:italic>) act as maintenance hosts for foot‐and‐mouth disease (FMD) in southern Africa. A single buffalo can become infected with all three of the endemic serotypes of FMD virus (SAT‐1, SAT‐2, and SAT‐3) and pose a threat of infection to other susceptible cloven‐hoofed animals. The floods of 2000 in southern Africa damaged the Kruger National Park (KNP) game fence extensively, and there were several accounts of buffalo that had escaped from the park. The VP1 gene, which codes for the major antigenic determinant of the FMD virus, was used to determine phylogenetic relationships between virus isolates obtained from the outbreaks and those previously obtained from buffalo in the KNP. These results demonstrate that buffalo were most probably the source of the outbreaks, indicating that disease control using fencing as well as vaccination is extremely important to ensure that FMD does not become established in domestic livestock.</jats:p>",0

A Global Genomic Characterization of Nairoviruses Identifies Nine Discrete Genogroups with Distinctive Structural Characteristics and Host-Vector Associations,"<jats:p>Nairoviruses are primarily tick-borne bunyaviruses, some of which are known to cause mild-to-severe febrile illness in humans or livestock. We describe the genome sequences of 11 poorly characterized nairoviruses that have ecological associations with either birds (Farallon, Punta Salinas, Sapphire II, Zirqa, Avalon, Clo Mor, Taggert, and Abu Hammad viruses), rodents (Qalyub and Bandia viruses), or camels (Dera Ghazi Khan virus). Global phylogenetic analyses of proteins encoded in the L, M, and S RNA segments of these and 20 other available nairovirus genomes identified nine well-supported genogroups (Nairobi sheep disease, Thiafora, Sakhalin, Keterah, Qalyub, Kasokero, Dera Ghazi Khan, Hughes, and Tamdy). Genogroup-specific structural variations were evident, particularly in the M segment encoding a polyprotein from which virion envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) are generated by proteolytic processing. Structural variations include the extension, abbreviation, or absence sequences encoding an O-glycosylated mucin-like protein in the N-terminal domain, distinctive patterns of conserved cysteine residues in the GP38-like domain, insertion of sequences encoding a double-membrane-spanning protein (NSm) between the Gn and Gc domains, and the presence of an alternative long open reading frame encoding a viroporin-like transmembrane protein (Gx).

Identification of the Progenitors of Indonesian and Vietnamese Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Viruses from Southern China,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus to Southeast Asian countries triggered the first major outbreak and transmission wave in late 2003, accelerating the pandemic threat to the world. Due to the lack of influenza surveillance prior to these outbreaks, the genetic diversity and the transmission pathways of H5N1 viruses from this period remain undefined. To determine the possible source of the wave 1 H5N1 viruses, we recently conducted further sequencing and analysis of samples collected in live-poultry markets from Guangdong, Hunan, and Yunnan in southern China from 2001 to 2004. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of 73 H5N1 isolates from this period revealed a greater genetic diversity in southern China than previously reported. Moreover, results show that eight viruses isolated from Yunnan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to the clade 1 virus sublineage from Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while two viruses from Hunan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to viruses from Indonesia (clade 2.1). Further phylogenetic analyses of the six internal genes showed that all 10 of those viruses maintained similar phylogenetic relationships as the surface genes. The 10 progenitor viruses were genotype Z and shared high similarity (≥99%) with their corresponding descendant viruses in most gene segments. These results suggest a direct transmission link for H5N1 viruses between Yunnan and Vietnam and also between Hunan and Indonesia during 2002 and 2003. Poultry trade may be responsible for virus introduction to Vietnam, while the transmission route from Hunan to Indonesia remains unclear.</jats:p>",0

Isolation of a Reassortant H1N2 Swine Flu Strain of Type “Swine-Human-Avian” and Its Genetic Variability Analysis,"<jats:p>We isolated an influenza strain named A/Swine/Fujian/F1/2010 (H1N2) from a pig suspected to be infected with swine flu. The results of electron microscopy, hemagglutination (HA) assay, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and whole genome sequencing analysis suggest that it was a reassortant virus of swine (H1N1 subtype), human (H3N2 subtype), and avian influenza viruses. To further study the genetic evolution of A/Swine/Fujian/F1/2010 (H1N2), we cloned its whole genome fragments using RT-PCR and performed phylogenetic analysis on the eight genes. As a result, the nucleotide sequences of HA, NA, PB1, PA, PB2, NP, M, and NS gene are similar to those of A/Swine/Shanghai/1/2007(H1N2) with identity of 98.9%, 98.9%, 99.0%, 98.6%, 99.0%, 98.9%, 99.3%, and 99.3%, respectively. Similar to A/Swine/Shanghai/1/2007(H1N2), we inferred that the HA, NP, M, and NS gene fragments of A/Swine/Fujian/F1/2010 (H1N2) strain were derived from classical swine influenza H3N2 subtype, NA and PB1 were derived from human swine influenza H3N2 subtype, and PB2 and PA genes were derived from avian influenza virus. This further validates the role of swine as a “mixer” for influenza viruses.</jats:p>",0

            <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>
            , we have sequenced the complete genome of D3112. The genome is 37,611 bp, with an overall G+C content of 65%. We have identified 53 potential open reading frames, including three genes (the c repressor gene and early genes A and B) that have been previously characterized and sequenced. The organization of the putative coding regions corresponds to published genetic and transcriptional maps and is very similar to that of enterobacteriophage Mu. In contrast, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has classified D3112 as a λ-like phage on the basis of its morphology. Similarity-based analyses identified 27 open reading frames with significant matches to proteins in the NCBI databases. Forty-eight percent of these were similar to Mu-like phage and prophage sequences, including proteins responsible for transposition, transcriptional regulation, virion morphogenesis, and capsid formation. The tail proteins were highly similar to prophage sequences in
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            and phage Phi12 from

Different results were obtained from similarity-based versus phylogenetic analyses in some instances. Overall, our findings reveal a highly mosaic structure and suggest that extensive horizontal exchange of genetic material played an important role in the evolution of D3112.

Prevalence of Noroviruses and Sapoviruses in Swine of Various Ages Determined by Reverse Transcription-PCR and Microwell Hybridization Assays,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Noroviruses (NoVs) and sapoviruses (SaVs) are emerging enteric pathogens that cause diarrhea in humans and animals. Porcine genogroup II (GII) NoVs replicate in pigs, but their pathogenesis is undefined. The porcine SaV/GIII/Cowden/80/US strain causes diarrhea and intestinal lesions in pigs. Recently, genetically diverse porcine NoVs (genotypes 11, 18, and 19 within GII) and SaVs comprising at least two genogroups (GIII and GVI?/JJ681-like) and two unclassified strains (G?/QW19 and G?/LL26) were identified; however, their prevalence has not been reported. To investigate the prevalence of porcine NoVs and SaVs, 621 fecal samples were collected from swine of various ages from seven swine farms and one slaughterhouse in three states in the United States. Fecal samples were tested by reverse transcription-PCR and microwell hybridization assays with porcine NoV- and SaV-specific primers and probes, respectively. Porcine GII NoVs were detected exclusively from finisher pigs with an overall prevalence of 20%. Porcine GIII SaVs were detected in 62% of pigs, with the highest prevalence in postweaning pigs and lowest in nursing pigs. Porcine GVI?/JJ681-like SaVs and the G?/QW19-like SaVs were detected infrequently in pigs. The G?/LL26-like SaVs were detected mainly in younger pigs. Because some porcine NoVs and SaVs are genetically or antigenically related to human strains and recombinants within NoVs or SaVs occur for human and pig strains, the high prevalence and subclinical infection rate of these viruses in pigs raise questions of whether pigs may be reservoirs for human strains or for the emergence of new human and porcine recombinants.</jats:p>",0

"Divergent Pathogenic Properties of Circulating Coxsackievirus A6 Associated with Emerging Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease","<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) is an emerging pathogen associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Its genetic characterization and pathogenic properties are largely unknown. Here, we report 39 circulating CV-A6 strains isolated in 2013 from HFMD patients in northeast China. Three major clusters of CV-A6 were identified and related to CV-A6, mostly from Shanghai, indicating that domestic CV-A6 strains were responsible for HFMD emerging in northeast China. Four full-length CV-A6 genomes representing each cluster were sequenced and analyzed further. Bootscanning tests indicated that all four CV-A6-Changchun strains were most likely recombinants between the CV-A6 prototype Gdula and prototype CV-A4 or CV-A4-related viruses, while the recombination pattern was related to, yet distinct from, the strains isolated from other regions of China. Furthermore, different CV-A6 strains showed different capabilities of viral replication, release, and pathogenesis in a mouse model. Further analyses indicated that viral protein 2C contributed to the diverse pathogenic abilities of CV-A6 by causing autophagy and inducing cell death. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report lethal and nonlethal strains of CV-A6 associated with HFMD. The 2C protein region may play a key role in the pathogenicity of CV-A6 strains.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major and persistent threat to infants and children. Besides the most common pathogens, such as enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), other enteroviruses are increasingly contributing to HFMD. The present study focused on the recently emerged CV-A6 strain. We found that CV-A6 strains isolated in Changchun City in northeast China were associated with domestic origins. These Changchun viruses were novel recombinants of the CV-A6 prototype Gdula and CV-A4. Our results imply that measures to control CV-A6 transmission are urgently needed. Further analyses revealed differing pathogenicities in strains isolated in a neonatal mouse model. One of the possible causes has been narrowed down to the viral protein 2C, using phylogenetic studies, viral sequences, and direct tests on cultured human cells. Thus, the viral 2C protein is a promising target for antiviral drugs to prevent CV-A6-induced tissue damage.

Discovery of a Highly Divergent Coronavirus in the Asian House Shrew from China Illuminates the Origin of the Alphacoronaviruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Although shrews are one of the largest groups of mammals, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). We captured 266 Asian house shrews (
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Suncus murinus</jats:named-content>
            ) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, China, during 2013 to 2015. CoV RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02%. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from the RNA-positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into four lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses but sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel member of the genus
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Alphacoronavirus</jats:named-content>
            , which we denote Wénchéng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to genes of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution.

            contains several notorious human and animal pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Because of their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, it has been proposed that the alphacoronaviruses likely have their ultimate ancestry in the viruses residing in bats. Here, we describe a novel alphacoronavirus (Wénchéng shrew virus [WESV]) that was sampled from Asian house shrews in China. Notably, WESV is a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and possesses an S gene that is genetically distinct from those of all known coronaviruses. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to those of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are important and longstanding hosts for coronaviruses that merit additional research and surveillance.

Genetic characterization of a novel duck-origin picornavirus with six 2A proteins,"<jats:p>A novel virus was detected from diseased ducks and completely determined. The virus was shown to have a picornavirus-like genome layout. Interestingly, the genome contained a total of up to six 2As, including four 2As (2A1–2A4) each having an NPGP motif, an AIG1-like 2A5, and a parechovirus-like 2A6. The 5′UTR was predicted to possess a hepacivirus/pestivirus-like internal ribosome entry site (IRES). However, the subdomain IIIe consisted of a 3 nt stem and five unpaired bases, distinct from those found in all other HP-like IRESs. The virus was most closely related to duck hepatitis A virus, with amino acid identities of 37.7 %, 39 % and 43.7 % in the P1, P2 and P3 regions, respectively. Based on these investigations, together with phylogenetic analyses, the virus could be considered as the founding member of a novel picornavirus genus that we tentatively named ‘Aalivirus’, with ‘Aalivirus A’ as the type species.</jats:p>",0

Our previous study suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) play significant roles in the regulation of host response to AIV infection in layer chickens. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis if genetic background play essential role in the miRNA regulation of AIV infection in chickens and if miRNAs that were differentially expressed in layer with AIV infection would be modulated the same way in broiler chickens. Furthermore, by integrating with parallel mRNA expression profiling, potential molecular mechanisms of host response to AIV infection can be further exploited.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Total RNA isolated from the lungs of non-infected and low pathogenic H5N3 infected broilers at four days post-infection were used for both miRNA deep sequencing and mRNA microarray analyses. A total of 2.6 M and 3.3 M filtered high quality reads were obtained from infected and non-infected chickens by Solexa GA-I Sequencer, respectively. A total of 271 miRNAs in miRBase 16.0 were identified and one potential novel miRNA was discovered. There were 121 miRNAs differentially expressed at the 5% false discovery rate by Fisher’s exact test. More miRNAs were highly expressed in infected lungs (108) than in non-infected lungs (13), which was opposite to the findings in layer chickens. This result suggested that a different regulatory mechanism of host response to AIV infection mediated by miRNAs might exist in broiler chickens.

Antigenic analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 sublineages co-circulating in Egypt,"<jats:p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 has spread across Eurasia and Africa, and outbreaks are now endemic in several countries, including Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt. Continuous circulation of H5N1 virus in Egypt, from a single infected source, has led to significant genetic diversification with phylogenetically separable sublineages, providing an opportunity to study the impact of genetic evolution on viral phenotypic variation. In this study, we analysed the phylogeny of H5 haemagglutinin (HA) genes in influenza viruses isolated in Egypt from 2006 to 2011 and investigated the effect of conserved amino acid mutations in the HA genes in each of the sublineages on their antigenicity. The analysis showed that viruses in at least four sublineages still persisted in poultry in Egypt as of 2011. Using reverse genetics to generate HA-reassortment viruses with specific HA mutations, we found antigenic drift in the HA in two influenza virus sublineages, compared with the other currently co-circulating influenza virus sublineages in Egypt. Moreover, the two sublineages with significant antigenic drift were antigenically distinguishable. Our findings suggested that phylogenetically divergent H5N1 viruses, which were not antigenically cross-reactive, were co-circulating in Egypt, indicating that there was a problem in using a single influenza virus strain as seed virus to produce influenza virus vaccine in Egypt and providing data for designing more efficacious control strategies in H5N1-endemic areas.</jats:p>",0

First Evidence of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Infection in Wild Boars,"<jats:p>Background: The farming of wild boars has growing due to the interest of the human consumption of this exotic meat. Such a development may pose an increased risk of disease transmission between boars and domestic animals. The wild boar population has increased in South America in the last years due the absence of predator causing economic losses due to direct damage to crops and risk of disease transmission. The genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae are composed by four recognized species by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV): classical swine fever virus (CSFV), border disease virus (BDV), bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1) and 2 (BVDV-2). Other putative species denoted as atypical pesitiviruses have been reported as ‘HoBi’-like virus, giraffe pestivirus, Bungowannah pestivirus, Pronghorn antelope virus, atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV), Norwegian rat pestivirus (NrPV) and Rhinolophus affinis bat pestivirus (RaPestV-1). CSFV is commonly detected in wild boars, but despite positive serology, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was never detected in this animal species. Thereby, the present communication describes the first detection of BVDV in the lungs of captive boars using RT-PCR and DNA sequencing.Materials, Methods &amp; Results: Forty lung samples from farmed wild boars were collected after slaughter in a commercial abattoir. The organs were crushed separately, centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored for further analysis. The total RNA was isolated using a phenol-based protocol and RT-PCR protocol that amplified 118 bp of 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) was carried out. One out 40 samples resulted positive. The positive sample had partial fragments of 5’UTR and N terminal autoprotease (Npro) sequenced and analyzed. The strain LV Java/2012 presented 99% of identity in 5’UTR and 98% in Npro region with a BVDV-2 previously reported in bovines in Southern Brazil. In both 5’UTR and Npro phylogenetic analysis, the strain LV Java/2015 clustered with BVDV-2 strains and was most closely related to subtype 2b identified in bovines in Southern Brazil grouping in the same terminal node.Discussion: Wild boars are commonly associated to pathogen transmission to domestic animals. This animal species is considered a reservoir of the pestivirus CSFV and important keys in CSFV control and eradication programs in Europe. Despite indirect presence of BVDV was reported in wild boars by serology tests, the direct detection of the viral agent was never reported. The present study showed the presence of BVDV-2 genomic segments obtained by RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing in captive wild boars. The reported data suggests a possible importance of this animal species in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses which could interfere in control and eradication programs of these important pathogens for cattle worldwide. The strain LV Java/2012 was closely related to BVDV-2b and presented highest identity with a strain detected in cattle from Southern Brazil. This data suggests that wild boars and bovines could be sharing this pathogen due the similarity of the strains and that both were reported in the same region. It can lead to need of inclusion of wild swines in BVDV control programs since boars can circulate between different regions and carry this pathogen to different cattle herds. The present study reported the first molecular evidence of BVDV in wild boars in the literature. The data generated herein suggests a possible importance of boars in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses.</jats:p>",0

Genetic and Pathobiologic Characterization of Pandemic H1N1 2009 Influenza Viruses from a Naturally Infected Swine Herd,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Since its initial identification in Mexico and the United States, concerns have been raised that the novel H1N1 influenza virus might cause a pandemic of severity comparable to that of the 1918 pandemic. In late April 2009, viruses phylogenetically related to pandemic H1N1 influenza virus were isolated from an outbreak on a Canadian pig farm. This outbreak also had epidemiological links to a suspected human case. Experimental infections carried out in pigs using one of the swine isolates from this outbreak and the human isolate A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 showed differences in virus recovery from the lower respiratory tract. Virus was consistently isolated from the lungs of pigs infected with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009, while only one pig infected with A/swine/Alberta/OTH-33-8/2008 yielded live virus from the lung, despite comparable amounts of viral RNA and antigen in both groups of pigs. Clinical disease resembled other influenza virus infections in swine, albeit with somewhat prolonged virus antigen detection and delayed viral-RNA clearance from the lungs. There was also a noteworthy amount of genotypic variability among the viruses isolated from the pigs on the farm. This, along with the somewhat irregular pathobiological characteristics observed in experimentally infected animals, suggests that although the virus may be of swine origin, significant viral evolution may still be ongoing.</jats:p>",0

Coronavirus Pathogenesis and the Emerging Pathogen Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"<jats:sec><jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-strand RNA viruses classified within the Nidovirales order. This coronavirus family consists of pathogens of many animal species and of humans, including the recently isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This review is divided into two main parts; the first concerns the animal coronaviruses and their pathogenesis, with an emphasis on the functions of individual viral genes, and the second discusses the newly described human emerging pathogen, SARS-CoV. The coronavirus part covers (i) a description of a group of coronaviruses and the diseases they cause, including the prototype coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, which is one of the recognized animal models for multiple sclerosis, as well as viruses of veterinary importance that infect the pig, chicken, and cat and a summary of the human viruses; (ii) a short summary of the replication cycle of coronaviruses in cell culture; (iii) the development and application of reverse genetics systems; and (iv) the roles of individual coronavirus proteins in replication and pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV part covers the pathogenesis of SARS, the developing animal models for infection, and the progress in vaccine development and antiviral therapies. The data gathered on the animal coronaviruses continue to be helpful in understanding SARS-CoV.</jats:p></jats:sec>",0

Characterization of Unknown Orthobunya-Like Viruses from India,"<jats:p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of agents causing idiopathic human diseases has been crucial in the identification of novel viruses. This study describes the isolation and characterization of two novel orthobunyaviruses obtained from a jungle myna and a paddy bird from Karnataka State, India. Using an NGS approach, these isolates were classified as Cat Que and Balagodu viruses belonging to the Manzanilla clade of the Simbu serogroup. Closely related viruses in the Manzanilla clade have been isolated from mosquitos, humans, birds, and pigs across a wide geographic region. Since Orthobunyaviruses exhibit high reassortment frequency and can cause acute, self-limiting febrile illness, these data suggest that human and livestock infections of the Oya/Cat Que/Manzanilla virus may be more widespread and/or under-reported than anticipated. It therefore becomes imperative to identify novel and unknown viruses in order to understand their role in human and animal pathogenesis. The current study is a step forward in this regard and would act as a prototype method for isolation, identification and detection of several other emerging viruses.</jats:p>",0
"Prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis E virus among apparently healthy humans and pigs in Bali, Indonesia: Identification of a pig infected with a genotype 4 hepatitis E virus","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In Indonesia where hepatitis E virus (HEV) is believed to be highly endemic, only three outbreaks of HEV transmission have been documented to date in restricted areas (West Kalimantan and East Java). A total of 1,115 serum samples collected from apparently healthy individuals in Bali, Lombok, and Surabaya in Indonesia in 1996 where epidemic HEV transmissions have never been reported, were tested for IgG class antibodies to HEV (anti‐HEV). In Bali, anti‐HEV was detected in 20% (54/276) of the tested population, in remarkable contrast with 4% (17/446) in Lombok and 0.5% (2/393) in Surabaya. On the other hand, antibodies to hepatitis A virus were highly prevalent in all three regions (95% in Bali, 90% in Lombok, and 89% in Surabaya). Although the majority of the population in Indonesia is Moslem, Balinese people are mostly Hindu and have a habit of consuming pork. Therefore, serum samples were obtained from the 99 farm pigs in Bali and tested for anti‐HEV and HEV RNA. The sera from 71 pigs (72%) were positive for anti‐HEV and a 2‐month‐old pig had detectable HEV RNA. The swine HEV isolate recovered from the viremic pig was named SB66‐Bali. The SB66‐Bali isolate was most closely related to the genotype 4 isolates from China, India, Japan, and Taiwan, but shared only 82.6–90.0% identity in the common 241–412 nucleotides within open reading frame 2 (ORF2). These results indicate that a presumably indigenous HEV strain(s) is circulating in Bali, Indonesia and that HEV infection may occur via zoonosis even in developing countries. J. Med.

Matrix Gene of Influenza A Viruses Isolated from Wild Aquatic Birds: Ecology and Emergence of Influenza A Viruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Wild aquatic birds are the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses, but little is known about the viruses' gene pool in wild birds. Therefore, we investigated the ecology and emergence of influenza viruses by conducting phylogenetic analysis of 70 matrix (M) genes of influenza viruses isolated from shorebirds and gulls in the Delaware Bay region and from ducks in Alberta, Canada, during &gt;18 years of surveillance. In our analysis, we included 61 published M genes of isolates from various hosts. We showed that M genes of Canadian duck viruses and those of shorebird and gull viruses in the Delaware Bay shared ancestors with the M genes of North American poultry viruses. We found that North American and Eurasian avian-like lineages are divided into sublineages, indicating that multiple branches of virus evolution may be maintained in wild aquatic birds. The presence of non-H13 gull viruses in the gull-like lineage and of H13 gull viruses in other avian lineages suggested that gulls' M genes do not preferentially associate with the H13 subtype or segregate into a distinct lineage. Some North American avian influenza viruses contained M genes closely related to those of Eurasian avian viruses. Therefore, there may be interregional mixing of the two clades. Reassortment of shorebird M and HA genes was evident, but there was no correlation among the HA or NA subtype, M gene sequence, and isolation time. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that influenza viruses in wild waterfowl contain distinguishable lineages of M genes.</jats:p>",0

A Divergent Hepatitis D-Like Agent in Birds,"<jats:p>Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is currently only found in humans and is a satellite virus that depends on hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope proteins for assembly, release, and entry. Using meta-transcriptomics, we identified the genome of a novel HDV-like agent in ducks. Sequence analysis revealed secondary structures that were shared with HDV, including self-complementarity and ribozyme features. The predicted viral protein shares 32% amino acid similarity to the small delta antigen of HDV and comprises a divergent phylogenetic lineage. The discovery of an avian HDV-like agent has important implications for the understanding of the origins of HDV and sub-viral agents.</jats:p>",0

Here, we report analysis of the fecal virome of house mice in residential buildings in New York City, NY. Mice were collected at seven sites in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx over a period of 1 year. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of feces revealed 36 viruses from 18 families and 21 genera, including at least 6 novel viruses and 3 novel genera. A representative screen of 15 viruses by PCR confirmed the presence of 13 of these viruses in liver. We identified an uneven distribution of diversity, with several viruses being associated with specific locations. Higher mouse weight was associated with an increase in the number of viruses detected per mouse, after adjusting for site, sex, and length. We found neither genetic footprints to known human viral pathogens nor antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.

            Mice carry a wide range of infectious agents with zoonotic potential. Their proximity to humans in the built environment is therefore a concern for public health. Laboratory mice are also the most common experimental model for investigating the pathobiology of infectious diseases. In this survey of mice trapped in multiple locations within New York City over a period of 1 year, we found a diverse collection of viruses that includes some previously not associated with house mice and others that appear to be novel. Although we found no known human pathogens, our findings provide insights into viral ecology and may yield models that have utility for clinical microbiology.

Neutralizing DNA Aptamers against Swine Influenza H3N2 Viruses,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Triple reassortant influenza A viruses (IAVs) of swine, particularly the North American H3N2 subtype, circulate in swine herds and may reassort and result in the emergence of novel zoonotic strains. Current diagnostic tools rely on isolation of the viruses, followed by serotyping by hemagglutination or genome sequencing, both of which can be expensive and time-consuming. Thus, novel subtype-specific ligands and methods are needed for rapid testing and subtyping of IAVs in the field. To address this need, we selected DNA aptamers against the recombinant HA protein from swine IAV H3 cluster IV using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Four candidate aptamers (HA68, HA7, HA2a, and HA2b) were identified and characterized. The dissociation constants (

            ) of aptamers HA68, HA7, HA2a, and HA2b against recombinant H3 protein were 7.1, 22.3, 16.0, and 3.7 nM, respectively. The binding site of HA68 to H3 was identified to be between nucleotide residues 8 and 40. All aptamers inhibited H3 hemagglutination. HA68 was highly specific to all four lineages within the North American H3N2 subtype. Further, the other three aptamers specifically identified live viruses belonging to the phylogenetic clusters I, II/III, and IV especially the virus that closely related to the recent H3N2 variant (H3N2v). Aptamer HA68 was also able to bind and detect H3N2v isolated from recent human cases. In conclusion, we provide subtype-specific aptamers against H3N2 IAVs of swine that can now be used in rapid detection and typing protocols for field applications.

Resolving <i>Bovine viral diarrhea virus</i> subtypes from persistently infected U.S. beef calves with complete genome sequence,"<jats:p> Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified into 2 genotypes, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, each of which contains distinct subtypes with genetic and antigenic variation. To effectively control BVDV by vaccination, it is important to know which subtypes of the virus are circulating and how their prevalence is changing over time. Accordingly, the purpose of our study was to estimate the current prevalence and diversity of BVDV subtypes from persistently infected (PI) beef calves in the central United States. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5′-UTR (5′ untranslated region) for 119 virus strains revealed that a majority (82%) belonged to genotype 1b, and the remaining strains were distributed between genotypes 1a (9%) and 2 (8%); however, BVDV-2 subtypes could not be confidently resolved. Therefore, to better define the variability of U.S. BVDV isolates and further investigate the division of BVDV-2 isolates into subtypes, complete genome sequences were obtained for these isolates as well as representatives of BVDV-1a and -1b. Phylogenetic analyses of the complete coding sequence provided more conclusive genetic classification and revealed that U.S. BVDV-2 isolates belong to at least 3 distinct genetic groups that are statistically supported by both complete and individual coding gene analyses. These results show that a more complex set of BVDV-2 subtypes has been circulating in this region than was previously thought. </jats:p>",0

Eight new clade designations were recommended based on division of clade 1·1 (Mekong River Delta), 2·1·3·2 (Indonesia), 2·2·2 (India/Bangladesh), 2·2·1·1 (Egypt/Israel), and 2·3·2·1 (Asia). A simplification to the previously defined criteria, which adds a letter rather than number to the right‐most digit of fifth‐order clades, was proposed to facilitate this and future updates.</jats:p>",0

"Genetic and molecular characterization of H9N2 and H5 avian influenza viruses from live poultry markets in Zhejiang Province, eastern China","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Live poultry markets (LPMs) are a key source of reassorted avian influenza viruses (AIVs) because of the density of terrestrial and aquatic poultry and the frequency of AIV infection. H9N2 viruses are prevalent in terrestrial poultry throughout Asia and have been isolated from poultry outbreaks worldwide. They infect both avian and mammalian species and may be significant donors of genetic material to emerging human pathogens. LPMs in Zhejiang Province were surveyed from 2013–2014 for AIVs. Three hundred seventy-four (374) AIV strains were isolated from 3,328 samples. Whole–genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed. We identified a novel H9N2 virus genotype that had undergone reassortment with gene segments from Qa/HK/G1/97–like, Ck/BJ/1/94–like and Dk/HK/Y439/97–like viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested the H9N2 viruses had undergone reassortments with other AIV subtypes. The results also suggested that two different clades (2.3.2 and 2.3.4.6) of H5 viruses were co–circulating in Zhejiang Province. Given that reassorted H5 AIVs were detected in geese and ducks, it is possible that apparently healthy birds contribute to emerging H5 AIVs. Continued surveillance is required in poultry in eastern China.</jats:p>",0

Nine pairs of specific primers and a set of universal primers were designed; the multiplex PCR was established. The specificity and cross-reactivity of this assay were examined, and the detection limit was determined using serial 10-fold dilutions of plasmids containing the target sequences. The assay was further tested using 144 clinical samples. We found that the nine specific amplification peaks were observed, and the assay had a high degree of specificity, without nonspecific amplification. The simultaneous detection limit for the nine viruses reached 10000 copies <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> when all of the premixed viral targets were present. Seventy-seven of the clinical samples tested positive for at least one of the viruses; the principal viral infections in the clinical samples were porcine circovirus type 2 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. This approach has much potential for further development of high-throughput detection tools for the diagnosis of diseases in animals.</jats:p>",0

Deciphering the bat virome catalog to better understand the ecological diversity of bat viruses and the bat origin of emerging infectious diseases,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Studies have demonstrated that ~60%–80% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans originated from wild life. Bats are natural reservoirs of a large variety of viruses, including many important zoonotic viruses that cause severe diseases in humans and domestic animals. However, the understanding of the viral population and the ecological diversity residing in bat populations is unclear, which complicates the determination of the origins of certain EIDs. Here, using bats as a typical wildlife reservoir model, virome analysis was conducted based on pharyngeal and anal swab samples of 4440 bat individuals of 40 major bat species throughout China. The purpose of this study was to survey the ecological and biological diversities of viruses residing in these bat species, to investigate the presence of potential bat-borne zoonotic viruses and to evaluate the impacts of these viruses on public health. The data obtained in this study revealed an overview of the viral community present in these bat samples. Many novel bat viruses were reported for the first time and some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. This genetic evidence provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolution pattern of certain viruses, such as coronaviruses and noroviruses. These data offer meaningful ecological information for predicting and tracing wildlife-originated EIDs.</jats:p>",0

These included herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, a circovirus, a bocavirus, picornaviruses, a pestivirus, and a foamy virus. Pairwise alignments and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these novel viruses showed little genetic similarity with previously reported viruses. This study also revealed a high prevalence and diversity of bat astroviruses and coronaviruses in some provinces. These findings have expanded our understanding of the viromes of bats in China and hinted at the presence of a large variety of unknown mammalian viruses in many common bat species of mainland China.

Enhanced virome sequencing using targeted sequence capture,"<jats:p>Metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) is an important tool for characterizing viral populations. It is culture independent, requires no a priori knowledge of the viruses in the sample, and may provide useful genomic information. However, MSS can lack sensitivity and may yield insufficient data for detailed analysis. We have created a targeted sequence capture panel, ViroCap, designed to enrich nucleic acid from DNA and RNA viruses from 34 families that infect vertebrate hosts. A computational approach condensed ∼1 billion bp of viral reference sequence into &lt;200 million bp of unique, representative sequence suitable for targeted sequence capture. We compared the effectiveness of detecting viruses in standard MSS versus MSS following targeted sequence capture. First, we analyzed two sets of samples, one derived from samples submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory and one derived from samples collected in a study of fever in children. We detected 14 and 18 viruses in the two sets, comprising 19 genera from 10 families, with dramatic enhancement of genome representation following capture enrichment. The median fold-increases in percentage viral reads post-capture were 674 and 296. Median breadth of coverage increased from 2.1% to 83.2% post-capture in the first set and from 2.0% to 75.6% in the second set. Next, we analyzed samples containing a set of diverse anellovirus sequences and demonstrated that ViroCap could be used to detect viral sequences with up to 58% variation from the references used to select capture probes. ViroCap substantially enhances MSS for a comprehensive set of viruses and has utility for research and clinical applications.</jats:p>",0

            comprise two genera of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Despite considerable research efforts, the molecular events following Ebola virus (EBOV) infection are poorly understood. With the view of identifying host factors that underpin EBOV pathogenesis, we compared the transcriptomes of EBOV-infected human, pig, and bat kidney cells using a transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. Despite a significant difference in viral transcription/replication between the cell lines, all cells responded to EBOV infection through a robust induction of extracellular growth factors. Furthermore, a significant upregulation of activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor complex members
            <jats:italic>FOS</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>JUN</jats:italic>
            was observed in permissive cell lines. Functional studies focusing on human cells showed that EBOV infection induces protein expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear accumulation of JUN and, to a lesser degree, FOS. Using a luciferase-based reporter, we show that EBOV infection induces AP1 transactivation activity within human cells at 48 and 72 h postinfection. Finally, we show that JUN knockdown decreases the expression of EBOV-induced host gene expression. Taken together, our study highlights the role of AP1 in promoting the host gene expression profile that defines EBOV pathogenesis.

            Many questions remain about the molecular events that underpin filovirus pathophysiology. The rational design of new intervention strategies, such as postexposure therapeutics, will be significantly enhanced through an in-depth understanding of these molecular events. We believe that new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EBOV may be possible by examining the transcriptomic response of taxonomically diverse cell lines (derived from human, pig, and bat). We first identified the responsive pathways using an RNA-seq-based transcriptomics approach. Further functional and computational analysis focusing on human cells highlighted an important role for the AP1 transcription factor in mediating the transcriptional response to EBOV infection. Our study sheds new light on how host transcription factors respond to and promote the transcriptional landscape that follows viral infection.

Identification and Classification of Endogenous Retroviruses in Cattle,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            The aim of this study was to identify the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences in a bovine genome. We subjected bovine genomic DNA to PCR with degenerate or ovine ERV (OERV) family-specific primers that aimed to amplify the retroviral
            <jats:italic>pro/pol</jats:italic>
            region. Sequence analysis of 113 clones obtained by PCR revealed that 69 were of retroviral origin. On the basis of the OERV classification system, these clones from degenerate PCR could be divided into the β3, γ4, and γ9 families. PCR with OERV family-specific primers revealed an additional ERV that was classified into the bovine endogenous retrovirus (BERV) γ7 family. In conclusion, here we report the results of a genome scale study of the BERV. Our study shows that the ERV family expansion in cattle may be somewhat limited, while more diverse family members of ERVs have been reported from other artiodactyls, such as pigs and sheep.

Aberrant host immune response induced by highly virulent PRRSV identified by digital gene expression tag profiling,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>There was a large scale outbreak of the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in China and Vietnam during 2006 and 2007 that resulted in unusually high morbidity and mortality among pigs of all ages. The mechanisms underlying the molecular pathogenesis of the highly virulent PRRS virus (H-PRRSV) remains unknown. Therefore, the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after H-PRRSV infection and infection pathology were analyzed in this study using high-throughput deep sequencing and histopathology.</jats:p>
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>H-PRRSV infection resulted in severe lung pathology. The results indicate that aberrant host innate immune responses to H-PRRSV and induction of an anti-apoptotic state could be responsible for the aggressive replication and dissemination of H-PRRSV. Prolific rapid replication of H-PRRSV could have triggered aberrant sustained expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines leading to a markedly robust inflammatory response compounded by significant cell death and increased oxidative damage. The end result was severe tissue damage and high pathogenicity.</jats:p>

            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            <jats:p>The systems analysis utilized in this study provides a comprehensive basis for better understanding the pathogenesis of H-PRRSV. Furthermore, it allows the genetic components involved in H-PRRSV resistance/susceptibility in swine populations to be identified.</jats:p>

Hybrid DNA virus in Chinese patients with seronegative hepatitis discovered by deep sequencing,"<jats:p>
            Seronegative hepatitis—non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis—is poorly characterized but strongly associated with serious complications. We collected 92 sera specimens from patients with non-A–E hepatitis in Chongqing, China between 1999 and 2007. Ten sera pools were screened by Solexa deep sequencing. We discovered a 3,780-bp contig present in all 10 pools that yielded BLASTx E scores of 7e-05–0.008 against parvoviruses. The complete sequence of the
            <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic>
            -assembled 3,780-bp contig was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions over almost the entire genome, and the virus was provisionally designated NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of two major ORFs. By protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the replication-associated protein of bat circovirus and the capsid protein of porcine parvovirus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NIH-CQV is located at the interface of
            <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>
            . Prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. Sixty-three of 90 patient samples (70%) were positive, but all those from 45 healthy controls were negative. Average virus titer in the patient specimens was 1.05 e4 copies/µL. Specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were sought by immunoblotting. Eighty-four percent of patients were positive for IgG, and 31% were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78% of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although more work is needed to determine the etiologic role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data indicate that a parvovirus-like virus is highly prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-A–E hepatitis.

            In addition to causing illness, viruses leave indelible footprints behind, because infection permanently alters the immune system. Blood tests that detect antiviral antibodies can provide information about both past and present viral exposures. Typically, such tests measure only one virus at a time.

            developed a blood test that identifies antibodies against all known human viruses. They studied blood samples from nearly 600 people of differing ages and geographic locations and found that most had been exposed to about 10 viral species over their lifetime. Despite differences in the rates of exposure to specific viruses, the antibody responses in most individuals targeted the same viral epitopes.

Transcriptome Analysis of HepG2 Cells Expressing ORF3 from Swine Hepatitis E Virus to Determine the Effects of ORF3 on Host Cells,"<jats:p>Hepatitis E virus- (HEV-) mediated hepatitis has become a global public health problem. An important regulatory protein of HEV, ORF3, influences multiple signal pathways in host cells. In this study, to investigate the function of ORF3 from the swine form of HEV (SHEV), high-throughput RNA-Seq-based screening was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes in ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells. The results were validated with quantitative real-time PCR and gene ontology was employed to assign differentially expressed genes to functional categories. The results indicated that, in the established ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells, the mRNA levels of CLDN6, YLPM1, APOC3, NLRP1, SCARA3, FGA, FGG, FGB, and FREM1 were upregulated, whereas the mRNA levels of SLC2A3, DKK1, BPIFB2, and PTGR1 were downregulated. The deregulated expression of CLDN6 and FREM1 might contribute to changes in integral membrane protein and basement membrane protein expression, expression changes for NLRP1 might affect the apoptosis of HepG2 cells, and the altered expression of APOC3, SCARA3, and DKK1 may affect lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, ORF3 plays a functional role in virus-cell interactions by affecting the expression of integral membrane protein and basement membrane proteins and by altering the process of apoptosis and lipid metabolism in host cells. These findings provide important insight into the pathogenic mechanism of HEV.</jats:p>",0

"Epidemiological and Evolutionary Inference of the Transmission Network of the 2014 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N2 Outbreak in British Columbia, Canada","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The first North American outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) involving a virus of Eurasian A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1) lineage began in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada in late November 2014. A total of 11 commercial and 1 non-commercial (backyard) operations were infected before the outbreak was terminated. Control measures included movement restrictions that were placed on a total of 404 individual premises, 150 of which were located within a 3 km radius of an infected premise(s) (IP). A complete epidemiological investigation revealed that the source of this HPAI H5N2 virus for 4 of the commercial IPs and the single non-commercial IP likely involved indirect contact with wild birds. Three IPs were associated with the movement of birds or service providers and localized/environmental spread was suspected as the source of infection for the remaining 4 IPs. Viral phylogenies, as determined by Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood methods, were used to validate the epidemiologically inferred transmission network. The phylogenetic clustering of concatenated viral genomes and the median-joining phylogenetic network of the viruses supported, for the most part, the transmission network that was inferred by the epidemiologic analysis.</jats:p>",0

Failed detection of <i>Bovine viral diarrhea virus 2</i> subgenotype a (BVDV-2a) by direct fluorescent antibody test on tissue samples due to reduced reactivity of field isolates to raw anti-BVDV antibody,"<jats:p> Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) is associated with mild or subclinical infections, whereas BVDV-2 is frequently implicated in outbreaks of severe thrombocytopenia and acute fatal disease. In the present study, the carcass of a beef breed cow and tissue samples of a beef calf were received for laboratory diagnosis. Both animals exhibited severe clinical signs compatible with thrombocytopenia or hemorrhagic syndrome. Direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) failed to detect BVDV antigen in the tissue specimens of both cases. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed the presence of BVDV antigen in oral and esophageal mucosa and Peyer patches of the beef breed cow. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) detected BVDV-2 in selected tissues of both animals. Subsequently, BVDV was isolated from both cases and subjected to genetic and serologic characterizations. Mutations in the 5′–untranslated genomic region (5′-UTR) primer and probe binding sites and the E2 gene were associated with reduced efficiency of an established real-time RT-PCR assay and amino acid alterations in the E2 glycoprotein, respectively. Both viral isolates were classified by real-time RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis as BVDV-2 subgenotype a. Unlike BVDV reference strains Singer and 125c, the isolates cross-reacted with anti–BVDV-1 and anti–BVDV-2 reference sera, indicating antigenic variations in field isolates. The isolates also showed reduced reactivity to porcine anti-BVDV antiserum (the raw serum used to produce BVDV DFA conjugate). In summary, data from the present investigation indicated that genetic and antigenic variations affected the performance of detection assays, especially DFAT, highlighting the need for regular evaluation and modification of BVDV tests. </jats:p>",0

Novel characteristics of the avian gyrovirus 2 genome,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2) was the second member of the viral genus <jats:italic>Cyclovirus</jats:italic> to be discovered. This virus poses a significant potential threat to humans and poultry due to its global dissemination and infectiousness. We used three overlapping polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to map the whole genome of AGV2. We then modelled the evolutionary history of these novel sequence data in the context of related sequences from GenBank. We analysed the viral protein characteristics of the different phylogenetic groups and explored differences in evolutionary trends between Chinese strains and strains from other countries. We obtained 17 avian-sourced AGV2 whole genomes from different regions of China from 2015 to 2016. Phylogenetic analyses of these Chinese AGV2 sequences and related sequences produced four distinct groups (A–D) with significant bootstrap values. We also built phylogenies using predicted viral protein sequences. We found a potential hypervariable region in VP1 at sites 288–314, and we identified the amino acid changes responsible for the distinct VP2 and VP3 groups. Three new motifs in the AGV2 5′-UTR direct repeat (DR) region were discovered and grouped. The novel characteristics and diverse research on the AGV2 genome provide a valuable framework for additional research.</jats:p>",0

The genetic basis of its pathogenesis remains enigmatic and no effective prevention measures have been established. To better understand the virulence differentiation of <jats:italic>S. suis</jats:italic> and develop a promising vaccine, we isolated and sequenced a native avirulent <jats:italic>S. suis</jats:italic> strain (05HAS68). Animal experiments revealed that 05HAS68 is an avirulent strain and could protect piglets from the attack of virulent strains. Comparative genomics analyses demonstrated the genetic basis for the lack of virulence in 05HAS68, which is characterized by the absence of some important virulence-associated factors and the intact 89K pathogenicity island. Lack of virulence was also illustrated by reduced survival of 05HAS68 compared to a virulent strain in pig whole blood. Further investigations revealed a large-scale genomic rearrangement in 05HAS68, which was proposed to be mediated by transposase genes and/or prophages. This genomic rearrangement may have caused the genomic diversity of <jats:italic>S. suis</jats:italic> and resulted in biological discrepancies between 05HAS68 and highly virulent <jats:italic>S. suis</jats:italic> strains.</jats:p>",0
Novel microRNAs encoded by duck enteritis virus,"<jats:p>Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is an important herpesvirus pathogen associated with acute, highly contagious lethal disease in waterfowls.

Unlike most mardivirus-encoded miRNAs, DEV-encoded miRNAs mapped mostly to the unique long region of the genome. The precursors of DEV miR-D18 and miR-D19 overlapped with each other, suggesting similarities to miRNA-offset RNAs, although only the DEV-miR-D18-3p was functional in reporter assays. Identification of these novel miRNAs will add to the growing list of virus-encoded miRNAs enabling the exploration of their roles in pathogenesis.</jats:p>",0

Polymerase Chain Reaction–based Genetic Typing of Japanese Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Viruses,"<jats:p> Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSVs) are classified into 2 distinct genotypes: the North American type and the European type. The Japanese PRRSVs were genotyped by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction using the reported primer pairs that were either reactive to both types, specific to the North American type or specific to the European type. All the PRRSV genomes from 66 tissue homogenates or sera and 55 infectious viruses were of the North American type, whereas no European-type viral genome was detected. Two PCR primers specific to the North American type showed different detection efficiency. Half of the tissue samples and 15% of the infectious viruses were not detected with one primer pair, although all of them were detected with the other primer pair. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of the forward-and reverse primer–binding sites of the nonreactive viruses indicated that all these viruses had nucleotide mismatches within the 4 bases corresponding to the 3′ end of the reverse primer. These mismatches appeared to be responsible for the nonreactivity of the former primers to these viruses. </jats:p>",0

"Molecular epidemiology of coxsackievirus A6 derived from hand, foot, and mouth disease in Fukuoka between 2013 and 2017","<jats:p>Coxsackievirus (CV)‐A6 has been the primary causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in Japan since 2011. In Fukuoka, CV‐A6‐associated HFMD caused epidemics in 2013, 2015, and 2017. This paper reports the genetic characteristics of the CV‐A6 entire viral protein 1 (VP1) derived from patients with HFMD in Fukuoka between 2013 and 2017. CV‐A6 was detected in 105 of 280 clinical specimens, and the entire VP1 sequences could be analyzed for 90 of the 105 specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CV‐A6 strains were classified into clade A and subgrouped into subclade A3 or subclade A4. Each subclade strain carried amino acid substitutions in the presumed DE and GH loops of the VP1, and no amino acid substitutions were identified as deleterious to the protein function. No significant difference was found in the clinical symptoms between the genetic subclades using statistical analyses. In conclusion, this study clarified the genetic diversity of CV‐A6 in Fukuoka from 2013 to 2017. The emergence of the CV‐A6 strains was classified into derived new subclades based on phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene that may cause CV‐A6‐associated HFMD epidemics approximately every 2 years.</jats:p>",0

Influenza H7N9 and H9N2 Viruses: Coexistence in Poultry Linked to Human H7N9 Infection and Genome Characteristics,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Avian influenza virus A of the novel H7N9 reassortant subtype was recently found to cause severe human respiratory infections in China. Live poultry markets were suspected locations of the human H7N9 infection sources, based on the cases' exposure histories and sequence similarities between viral isolates. To explore the role of live poultry markets in the origin of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental specimens from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as well as high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified specimens positive for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all of the 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks, and environmental specimens from the markets contained heavily mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2 and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea of the coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, human H7N9 infection cases (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 31) were all negative for H9N2 virus according to real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2, and internal-segment sequences were very close to the sequence of the H9N2 virus circulating in chickens in China recently. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains coexisted with the novel human-pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically linked live poultry markets. Avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus and continues to do so.

            Our results suggest that avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus, a novel reassortant avian influenza virus A subtype, and continues to do so. The finding helps shed light on how the H7N9 virus emerged, spread, and transmitted to humans. It is of considerable interest for assessing the risk of the possible emergence of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced transmissibility to humans.

Newly Emergent Highly Pathogenic H5N9 Subtype Avian Influenza A Virus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The novel H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) was demonstrated to cause severe human respiratory infections in China. Here, we examined poultry specimens from live bird markets linked to human H7N9 infection in Hangzhou, China. Metagenomic sequencing revealed mixed subtypes (H5, H7, H9, N1, N2, and N9). Subsequently, AIV subtypes H5N9, H7N9, and H9N2 were isolated. Evolutionary analysis showed that the hemagglutinin gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/LBM227/2012 (H5N1), which belongs to clade 2.3.2.1. The neuraminidase gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from 
human-infective A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9). The six internal genes were similar to those of other H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 virus strains. The virus harbored the PQRERRRKR/GL motif characteristic of highly pathogenic AIVs at the HA cleavage site. Receptor-binding experiments demonstrated that the virus binds α-2,3 sialic acid but not α-2,6 sialic acid. Identically, pathogenicity experiments also showed that the virus caused low mortality rates in mice. This newly isolated H5N9 virus is a highly pathogenic reassortant virus originating from H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes. Live bird markets represent a potential transmission risk to public health and the poultry industry.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>
            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            This investigation confirms that the novel H5N9 subtype avian influenza A virus is a reassortant strain originating from H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes and is totally different from the H5N9 viruses reported before. The novel H5N9 virus acquired a highly pathogenic H5 gene and an N9 gene from human-infecting subtype H7N9 but caused low mortality rates in mice. Whether this novel H5N9 virus will cause human infections from its avian host and become a pandemic subtype is not known yet. It is therefore imperative to assess the risk of emergence of this novel reassortant virus with potential transmissibility to public health.

"Hepatitis E Virus: Foodborne, Waterborne and Zoonotic Transmission","<jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for epidemics and endemics of acute hepatitis in humans, mainly through waterborne, foodborne, and zoonotic transmission routes. HEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus classified in the family Hepeviridae and encompasses four known Genotypes (1–4), at least two new putative genotypes of mammalian HEV, and one floating genus of avian HEV. Genotypes 1 and 2 HEVs only affect humans, while Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic and responsible for sporadic and autochthonous infections in both humans and several other animal species worldwide. HEV has an ever-expanding host range and has been identified in numerous animal species. Swine serve as a reservoir species for HEV transmission to humans; however, it is likely that other animal species may also act as reservoirs. HEV poses an important public health concern with cases of the disease definitively linked to handling of infected pigs, consumption of raw and undercooked animal meats, and animal manure contamination of drinking or irrigation water. Infectious HEV has been identified in numerous sources of concern including animal feces, sewage water, inadequately-treated water, contaminated shellfish and produce, as well as animal meats. Many aspects of HEV pathogenesis, replication, and immunological responses remain unknown, as HEV is an extremely understudied but important human pathogen. This article reviews the current understanding of HEV transmission routes with emphasis on food and environmental sources and the prevalence of HEV in animal species with zoonotic potential in humans.</jats:p>",0

Mapping the virome in wild-caught Aedes aegypti from Cairns and Bangkok,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Medically important arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses are primarily transmitted by the globally distributed mosquito <jats:italic>Aedes aegypti</jats:italic>. Increasing evidence suggests that transmission can be influenced by mosquito viromes. Herein RNA-Seq was used to characterize RNA metaviromes of wild-caught <jats:italic>Ae</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>aegypti</jats:italic> from Bangkok (Thailand) and from Cairns (Australia). The two mosquito populations showed a high degree of similarity in their viromes. BLAST searches of assembled contigs suggest up to 27 insect-specific viruses may infect <jats:italic>Ae</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>aegypti</jats:italic>, with up to 23 of these currently uncharacterized and up to 16 infecting mosquitoes from both Cairns and Bangkok. Three characterized viruses dominated, Phasi Charoen-like virus, Humaita-Tubiacanga virus and Cell fusing agent virus, and comparisons with other available RNA-Seq datasets suggested infection levels with these viruses may vary in laboratory-reared mosquitoes. As expected, mosquitoes from Bangkok showed higher mitochondrial diversity and carried alleles associated with knock-down resistance to pyrethroids. Blood meal reads primarily mapped to human genes, with a small number also showing homology with rat/mouse and dog genes. These results highlight the wide spectrum of data that can be obtained from such RNA-Seq analyses, and suggests differing viromes may need to be considered in arbovirus vector competence studies.</jats:p>",0

ICTV Virus Taxonomy Profile: Picornaviridae,"<jats:p>The family <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic> comprises small non-enveloped viruses with RNA genomes of 6.7 to 10.1 kb, and contains &gt;30 genera and &gt;75 species. Most of the known picornaviruses infect mammals and birds, but some have also been detected in reptiles, amphibians and fish. Many picornaviruses are important human and veterinary pathogens and may cause diseases of the central nervous system, heart, liver, skin, gastrointestinal tract or upper respiratory tract. Most picornaviruses are transmitted by the faecal–oral or respiratory routes.

Molecular-based reclassification of the bovine enteroviruses,"<jats:p>Bovine enteroviruses are currently classified into two serotypes within the species<jats:italic>Bovine enterovirus</jats:italic>(BEV). Comparison of the sequences of six American and eleven German BEV isolates with published BEV sequences revealed the necessity to revise the taxonomy of these viruses. Molecular data indicate that the bovine enteroviruses are composed of two clusters (designated BEV-A and -B) each with two and three geno-/serotypes, respectively. Whereas low amino acid identity of the capsid proteins 1C (VP3) and 1D (VP1) is the main criterion for the discrimination of geno-/serotypes, the BEV clusters, presumably representing species, differ in sequence identity of all viral proteins. In addition, characteristic lengths of (i) the capsid proteins 1B, 1C and 1D, (ii) the 2C protein, and (iii) the 3′-non-translated region are observed. The BEVs can be distinguished from the other enteroviruses by sequence identity and unique features of the 5′-non-translated region, i.e. a conserved second cloverleaf and characteristic RNA structures of the internal ribosome entry site. Phylogenetically, the closest relatives of the bovine enteroviruses are the porcine enteroviruses. Incongruent phylogenies of the 5′-non-translated region, the capsid proteins and the 3D polymerase indicate frequent intraserotypic and interserotypic recombination within the non-capsid and the capsid region of the BEV genome.</jats:p>",0

Viral metagenomics analysis demonstrates the diversity of viral flora in piglet diarrhoeic faeces in China,"<jats:p>To investigate the diversity of viral flora, we used metagenomics to study the viral communities in a pooled faecal sample of 27 diarrhoeic piglets from intensive commercial farms in China. The 15 distinct mammalian viruses identified in the pooled diarrhoeic sample were, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, <jats:italic>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</jats:italic> (PEDV), sapovirus, porcine bocavirus-4 (PBoV-4), sapelovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, PBoV-2, stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus (poSCV), astrovirus (AstV), kobuvirus, posavirus-1, porcine enterovirus-9 (PEV-9), porcine circovirus-like (po-circo-like) virus, picobirnavirus (PBV) and <jats:italic>Torque teno sus virus 2</jats:italic> (TTSuV-2). The prevalence rate of each virus was verified from diarrhoeic and healthy piglets by PCR assay. A mean of 5.5 different viruses were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact co-infected with 11 different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets. Furthermore, we report here for the first time the presence of several recently described viruses in China, and the identification of novel genotypes. Therefore, our investigation results provide an unbiased survey of viral communities and prevalence in faecal samples of piglets.</jats:p>",0

Porcine bocaviruses: genetic analysis and prevalence in Chinese swine population,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>In members of the<jats:italic>Bocavirus</jats:italic>genus, that contain three open reading frames (ORFs) of the Parvovirinae subfamily, porcine bocaviruses (PoBoVs) exhibit the most genetic diversity. Based on the ORF2-encoded viral protein (VP1) classification, the six reported porcine bocaviruses were grouped into four species: PoBoV1 (porcine boca-like virus or PBoLV), PoBoV2 (porcine parvovirus 4 or PPV4), PoBoV3 (PBoV1/PBoV2) and PoBoV4 (6V/7V), with PoBoV3 and PoBoV4 each having two genotype viruses. All four PoBoV species were detected in the 166 samples collected in 2010 from swine herds located in ten provinces of China. The detection rates for PoBoV1-4 were 28·9%, 6·6%, 19·3% and 39·7%, respectively. The co-infection combinations involving these six porcine bocaviruses in the collected samples were very complex. Furthermore, mixed infections with viruses from other families (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, classic swine fever virus and porcine circovirus type 2) were also detected.</jats:p>",0

High-throughput whole genome sequencing of <i>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus</i> from cell culture materials and clinical specimens using next-generation sequencing technology,"<jats:p> Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have increasingly played crucial roles in biological and medical research, but are not yet in routine use in veterinary diagnostic laboratories. We developed and applied a procedure for high-throughput RNA sequencing of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from cell culture–derived isolates and clinical specimens. Ten PRRSV isolates with known sequence information, 2 mixtures each with 2 different PRRSV isolates, and 51 clinical specimens (19 sera, 16 lungs, and 16 oral fluids) with various PCR threshold cycle (Ct) values were subjected to nucleic acid extraction, cDNA library preparation (24-plexed), and sequencing. Whole genome sequences were obtained from 10 reference isolates with expected sequences and from sera with a PRRSV real-time reverse transcription PCR Ct ≤ 23.6, lung tissues with Ct ≤ 21, and oral fluids with Ct ≤ 20.6. For mixtures with PRRSV-1 and -2 isolates (57.8% nucleotide identity), NGS was able to distinguish them as well as obtain their respective genome sequences. For mixtures with 2 PRRSV-2 isolates (92.4% nucleotide identity), sequence reads with nucleotide ambiguity at numerous sites were observed, indicating mixed infection; however, individual virus sequences could only be separated when 1 isolate identity and sequence in the mixture is known. The NGS approach described herein offers the prospect of high-throughput sequencing and could be adapted to routine workflows in veterinary diagnostic laboratories, although further improvement of sequencing outcomes from clinical specimens with higher Ct values remains to be investigated. </jats:p>",0

Transcript Profiling Identifies Early Response Genes against FMDV Infection in PK-15 Cells,"<jats:p>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease that results in enormous economic loses worldwide. Although the protection provided by vaccination is limited during early infection, it is recognized as the best method to prevent FMD outbreaks. Furthermore, the mechanism of host early responses against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection remains unclear. In our study, a pig kidney cell line (PK-15) was used as a cell model to reveal the mechanism of early pig responses to FMDV infection. Four non-treated control and four FMDV-treated PK-15 cells were sequenced with RNA-seq technology, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed. The results showed that 1212 DEGs were in the FMDV-infected PK-15 cells, including 914 up-regulated and 298 down-regulated genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were significantly enriched in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NOD-like receptor, toll-like receptor, NF-κB, and the chemokine signaling pathways. To verify the results of the DEGs, 30 immune-related DEGs (19 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated) were selected for Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) verification. The results showed that RT-qPCR-measured genes exhibited a similar pattern as the RNA-seq analyses. Based on bioinformatics analysis, during FMDV early infection, we found that a series of cytokines, such as interleukins (IL6), chemokines (CXCL2, CCL20 and CCL4), and transcription factors (ZFP36, FOS, NFKBIA, ZBTB3, ZNF503, ZNF283, dymeclin (DYM), and orthodenticle homeobox 1 (OTX1)) were involved in the battle between FMDV and the host. Combined with their features and functions, we propose inflammation as the main early mechanism by which the host responds to FMDV infection. These data provide an additional panel of candidate genes for deciphering the mechanisms of a host’s early response against FMDV infection.</jats:p>",0
Evolution and Variation of the H3 Gene of Influenza A Virus and Interaction among Hosts,"<jats:p>&lt;i&gt;Objective:&lt;/i&gt; Continual mutations to the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza A virus generate novel antigenic strains that cause annual epidemics. The aim of this study was to evaluate evolution tendency of the H3 gene in a long period of time. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; 1842 H3 HA1 nucleotide strains of different hosts were collected for analysis. A two-step clustering method was used to divide strains into groups, and then a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on cluster results. Evolution rate in lineages were future estimated. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Tree structure showed three lineages: horse/canine, human/swine and avian. As a single trunk, the human/swine lineage was mainly composed of human strains, and more big branches appeared in recent years. Tree topology showed no evidence that swine affected the main evolution tendency of human H3 strains. The evolution rate of H3 strains varied between lineages. We observed that the rate in the human lineage decreased from 3.2 substitutions/year before 1980 to 1.8 after 1997. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; We concluded that the variation of human H3 gene was associated with swine strains but independent of others, including bird strains. The evolution rate of human H3 strains seems to have decreased in recent years, while the reasons for the rate change need to be further explored.</jats:p>",0
Faecal virome of cats in an animal shelter,"<jats:p>We describe the metagenomics-derived feline enteric virome in the faeces of 25 cats from a single shelter in California.

Novel species of astroviruses and bocaviruses, and the first genome of a cyclovirus in a feline were characterized. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region from four highly divergent partial viral genomes in the order <jats:italic>Picornavirales</jats:italic> were sequenced. The detection of such a diverse collection of viruses shed within a single shelter suggested that such animals experience robust viral exposures. This study increases our understanding of the viral diversity in cats, facilitating future evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials.</jats:p>",0

Hepatitis E Virus Infection among Domestic Animals in Eastern China,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen of which several species of animal were reported as reservoirs. Antibodies to HEV and HEV RNA have been detected in some Chinese population and swine groups but few other domestic animals. In this study, to investigate the HEV prevalence, we tested sera from 788 pigs, 100 cows, 50 goats, 49 horses, 101 pet dogs, 105 chickens, 47 duck and 45 pigeons in eastern China for anti‐HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG). We also tested 50% of the swine sera, all of sera from the other domestic animals and 13 Shanghai human sera which were positive for anti‐HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) for HEV RNA using reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction. Our results indicated that 82.5% (222/269) of the sows, 53.9% (104/193) of the 4‐ to 6‐month‐old swine, 63.4% (168/265) of the 1‐ to 3‐month‐old swine, 55.7% (34/61) of the slaughterhouse swine, 24% (12/50) of the goats, 16.3% (8/49) of the horses, 17.8% (21/101) of the pet dogs, 6% (6/100) of the cows, 12.8% (6/47) of the ducks, 4.4% (2/45) of the pigeons and 1.9% (2/105) of the chickens exhibited positive for anti‐HEV IgG. Inhibition assay confirmed the infection with HEV or HEV‐like viruses in these domestic animals except pigeons and chickens. From the sera, we isolated 18 swine HEV strains, one horse HEV strain and two human HEV strains. Sequence analysis showed that the horse HEV isolate and one swine isolate belonged to genotype 3. The other isolates belonged to genotype 4. The two human isolates were phylogenetically closely related to eight of the swine isolates. In short, the presence of anti‐HEV antibody had been confirmed in several species of domestic animals in eastern China and HEV RNA has been identified in swine, human and horse. This suggested that the authorities should pay more attention to the prevalence of HEV in eastern China.</jats:p>",0

          <jats:p>Pandemic influenza A viruses that emerge from animal reservoirs are inevitable. Therefore, rapid genomic analysis and creation of vaccines are vital. We developed a multisegment reverse transcription-PCR (M-RTPCR) approach that simultaneously amplifies eight genomic RNA segments, irrespective of virus subtype. M-RTPCR amplicons can be used for high-throughput sequencing and/or cloned into modified reverse-genetics plasmids via regions of sequence identity. We used these procedures to rescue a contemporary H3N2 virus and a swine origin H1N1 virus directly from human swab specimens. Together, M-RTPCR and the modified reverse-genetics plasmids that we designed streamline the creation of vaccine seed stocks (9 to 12 days).</jats:p>",0

Global pairwise RNA interaction landscapes reveal core features of protein recognition,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>RNA–protein interactions permeate biology. Transcription, translation, and splicing all hinge on the recognition of structured RNA elements by RNA-binding proteins. Models of RNA–protein interactions are generally limited to short linear motifs and structures because of the vast sequence sampling required to access longer elements. Here, we develop an integrated approach that calculates global pairwise interaction scores from in vitro selection and high-throughput sequencing. We examine four RNA-binding proteins of phage, viral, and human origin. Our approach reveals regulatory motifs, discriminates between regulated and non-regulated RNAs within their native genomic context, and correctly predicts the consequence of mutational events on binding activity. We design binding elements that improve binding activity in cells and infer mutational pathways that reveal permissive versus disruptive evolutionary trajectories between regulated motifs. These coupling landscapes are broadly applicable for the discovery and characterization of protein–RNA recognition at single nucleotide resolution.</jats:p>",0

Origins and Evolutionary Dynamics of H3N2 Canine Influenza Virus,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are maintained mainly in wild birds, and despite frequent spillover infections of avian IAVs into mammals, only a small number of viruses have become established in mammalian hosts. A new H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations of China and South Korea, and possibly in Thailand. The emergence of CIV provides new opportunities for zoonotic infections and interspecies transmission. We examined 14,764 complete IAV genomes together with all CIV genomes publicly available since its first isolation until 2013. We show that CIV may have originated as early as 1999 as a result of segment reassortment among Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages. We also identified amino acid changes that might have played a role in CIV emergence, some of which have not been previously identified in other cross-species jumps. CIV evolves at a lower rate than H3N2 human influenza viruses do, and viral phylogenies exhibit geographical structure compatible with high levels of local transmission. We detected multiple intrasubtypic and heterosubtypic reassortment events, including the acquisition of the NS segment of an H5N1 avian influenza virus that had previously been overlooked. In sum, our results provide insight into the adaptive changes required by avian viruses to establish themselves in mammals and also highlight the potential role of dogs to act as intermediate hosts in which viruses with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential could originate, particularly with an estimated dog population of ∼700 million.</jats:p>

            Influenza A viruses circulate in humans and animals. This multihost ecology has important implications, as past pandemics were caused by IAVs carrying gene segments of both human and animal origin. Adaptive evolution is central to cross-species jumps, and this is why understanding the evolutionary processes that shape influenza A virus genomes is key to elucidating the mechanisms underpinning viral emergence. An avian-origin canine influenza virus (CIV) has recently emerged in dogs and is spreading in Asia. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of CIV and show that it originated from both Eurasian and North American avian lineages. We also identified the mutations that might have been responsible for the cross-species jump. Finally, we provide evidence of multiple reassortment events between CIV and other influenza viruses (including an H5N1 avian virus). This is a cause for concern, as there is a large global dog population to which humans are highly exposed.

Phylogenetic Analysis of the Rabies Virus N-coding Region in Lithuanian Rabies Isolates,"<jats:p>Rabies infection among wild and domestic animals constitutes a well-known problem in Lithuania, but only one dog rabies virus isolate sequence (1992) from Lithuania was used in the European rabies virus phylogenetic analysis. The objective of this work was to determine nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences and genetically characterize the rabies virus isolates in order to learn which virus group (biotype) is circulating in reservoir species in Lithuania. Classical rabies virus isolate nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences from different parts of Lithuania were found to be closely related to each other and demonstrated nucleotide identity from 97.7 to 100% and could be placed in one lineage with 100% bootstrap support. All 12 sequences of raccoon dogs, red foxes, dogs and marten rabies viruses exhibited 97.7 - 99.0% identity to previously published sequences from Eastern parts of Poland, Estonia, Finland, and the North-Eastern part of Russia. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Lithuanian strains belong to the North East Europe (NEE) group of rabies virus.</jats:p>",0

Novel Picornavirus Associated with Avian Keratin Disorder in Alaskan Birds,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>
          <jats:p>
            Avian keratin disorder (AKD), characterized by debilitating overgrowth of the avian beak, was first documented in black-capped chickadees (
            <jats:italic>Poecile atricapillus</jats:italic>
            ) in Alaska. Subsequently, similar deformities have appeared in numerous species across continents. Despite the widespread distribution of this emerging pathology, the cause of AKD remains elusive. As a result, it is unknown whether suspected cases of AKD in the afflicted species are causally linked, and the impacts of this pathology at the population and community levels are difficult to evaluate. We applied unbiased, metagenomic next-generation sequencing to search for candidate pathogens in birds affected with AKD. We identified and sequenced the complete coding region of a novel picornavirus, which we are calling poecivirus. Subsequent screening of 19 AKD-affected black-capped chickadees and 9 control individuals for the presence of poecivirus revealed that 19/19 (100%) AKD-affected individuals were positive, while only 2/9 (22%) control individuals were infected with poecivirus. Two northwestern crows (
            <jats:italic>Corvus caurinus</jats:italic>
            ) and two red-breasted nuthatches (
            <jats:italic>Sitta canadensis</jats:italic>
            ) with AKD-consistent pathology also tested positive for poecivirus. We suggest that poecivirus is a candidate etiological agent of AKD.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Avian keratin disorder (AKD) is an increasingly common disease of wild birds. This disease, characterized by beak overgrowth, was first described in the late 1990s and has been spreading rapidly both geographically and in terms of host species affected. AKD decreases host fitness and can be fatal. However, the cause of the disease has remained elusive, and its impact on host populations is poorly understood. We found a novel and divergent picornavirus in 19/19 AKD-affected black-capped chickadees that we examined but in only 2/9 control cases. We also found this virus in 4 individuals of 2 other passerine species that exhibited symptoms consistent with AKD. Our data suggest that this novel picornavirus warrants further investigation as the causative agent of AKD.
